Thus the line AE running out through the earth B among the fixed stars will intersect the ecliptic, and AC will intersect the orbit of Mars.

Therefore, as AC is to EBC, so is BA to BCA, 2\u00b0 43\u2019 27\u201c ^23. This, subtracted from EBC, leaves the required angle BAC, 1\u00b0 48\u2019 43\u201c; hence, right at the limit, it would be about 1\u00b0 49\u2019 and is somewhat altered if the ratio BA to AC is altered (more on this below). In this manner, from any given acronychal observation with a comparatively great latitude, the inclination is found, first, of that point on the orbit, and then at its maximum, by considering the distance from the node or limit. For example, on 1593 August 24, the apparent latitude at opposition to the sun comes out to be 6\u00b0 3\u2019 south ^24. Mars was at 12\u00bd\u00b0 Pisces.

Subtracting from CBE, this leaves the required angle BAC, 1\u00b0 41\u2019 50\u201c. However, this position is about 26\u00b0 from the limit, 64\u00b0 from the node. So, as the sine of 64\u00b0 is to this digression from the ecliptic of 1\u00b0 42\u2019, so is the whole sine to the maximum inclination of the planes, which comes out to be 1\u00b0 53\u2019.

Subtracting from CBE, this leaves the required angle BAC, 1\u00b0 41\u2019 50\u201c. However, this position is about 26\u00b0 from the limit, 64\u00b0 from the node. So, as the sine of 64\u00b0 is to this digression from the ecliptic of 1\u00b0 42\u2019, so is the whole sine to the maximum inclination of the planes, which comes out to be 1\u00b0 53\u2019.

For since the sun is nearly twice as far away from earth as is Mars, Mars\u2019s parallax will consequently be nearly twice the sun\u2019s. On the supposition that the sun\u2019s is 3\u2019, Mars\u2019s will be about 5\u2019. Now when 9\u00b0 Sagittarius is rising, the nonagesimal10 is 55\u00b0 from the zenith. Opposite this number in our parallactic table,11 under the column headed 5\u2019, the latitudinal parallax 4\u2019 is shown.

And because the altitude of the nonagesimal is 26\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax15 at the horizon is 2\u2019 38\u201c. But Mars is 40\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, counting from 4\u00b0 Scorpio to 24\u00b0 Virgo, which, under the column  headed 2\u2019 38\u201c shows a true longitudinal parallax of 1\u2019 42\u201c. That hastens Mars further forward than when viewed from the center of the earth, and this is so on the assumption that it underwent no refraction. But to me it is more probable that it undergoes the same refraction as the sun, greater, that is, than that of the fixed stars, because the opposition of the sun and Mars stirs up the air, while the fixed stars are observed when the air is as calm as possible. Still, let there be no refraction at all, and let Mars be placed at 3\u00b0 57\u2019 Scorpio. At that moment the sun was at 5\u00b0 36\u2019 20\u201c Taurus. At this time, therefore, Mars was 1\u00b0 39\u2019 20\u201c past opposition to the sun. Mars\u2019s diurnal motion, as is clear from comparison with April 13, is 22\u2019 8\u201c; the sun\u2019s, 58\u2019 10\u201c; the sum, 1\u00b0 20\u2019 18\u201c. As this is to 24 hours, so is 1\u00b0 39\u2019 20\u201c to 1 day 5 hours 42 minutes. Therefore, the moment of opposition was April 14 at 6h 23m PM. Its position was 4\u00b0 24\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio, or a little past, if refraction were applied or if the previously assumed value for the diurnal parallax was too great. For reduction to the orbit, some imperceptible quantity must be subtracted, since it is barely 12 degrees from the node. This would be about 24 seconds, which are of no importance, and Mars would be at 4\u00b0 24\u2019 Scorpio, with latitude three minutes greater than before. For from that position, the latitude was decreasing from the eighth of March; nor was it a maximum at opposition.\nVI. On the night following 1591 June 6 at 12h 20m, Mars was found at 27\u00b0 14\u2019 42\u201c Sagittarius,16 with latitude 3\u00b0 55\u00bd\u2019 south. Refraction was of course provided for (from the table for the fixed stars), since it was large, in that Mars had no more than 6\u00b0 altitude on the meridian. There was, however, no mention of parallax. But at that time Mars was distant from the earth by half the solar distance. Therefore, the horizontal parallax is greater than 6 minutes, on the supposition that the sun\u2019s parallax is 3\u2019. I omit it nonetheless, partly because the refraction is supplied from the table for the sun (which, as I said, is the more probable), exceeding that which Brahe took here by 4\u00bd\u2019, which almost completely cancels out the parallax; and partly because Mars was on the meridian and near the winter solstice point, and thus had no longitudinal parallax. Of the latitude, on the other hand, it will have to be seen below in Part IV whether it might not be a few minutes less, since the parallax projects the planet too far south.\nThe sun was at 24\u00b0 58\u2019 10\u201c Gemini. The difference in position between the stars was 2\u00b0 16\u2019 10\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 57\u2019 8\u201c, and Mars\u2019s (for four days) was 1\u00b0 12\u2019 24\u201c, since on June 10 at 11h 50m it was at 26\u00b0 2\u2019 18\u201c Sagittarius. For one day, therefore, 18\u2019 12\u201c. The sum of the diurnal motions is 1\u00b0 15\u2019 20\u201c. This corresponds to 1 day 19 hours 24 minutes, which, added to the 6th at 12h 20m (because opposition was yet to come), shows [the moment of opposition to be] the 8th at 7h 43m. Mars\u2019s position was 26\u00b0 41\u2019 48\u201c Sagittarius, to which are added 52\u201c for reduction to the orbit, so as to make it about 26\u00b0 43\u2019 Sagittarius. The latitude was six minutes greater than on 6 June, because, by the observations, the latitude here was increasing until the fortieth day after opposition, and increased nearly thirteen minutes between the 6th and the 10th of June. Therefore, ignoring parallax and keeping the same refraction, it would be 4\u00b0 1\u00bd\u2019 ^17. VII. On 1593 August 24 at 10h 30m, the ecliptic position of Mars was found  to be 12\u00b0 38\u2019 Pisces,18 with latitude 6\u00b0 5\u2019 30\u201c south. The altitude was great enough that horizontal variations canceled one another. On the August 29th following, at 10h 20m, Mars was observed at 11\u00b0 15\u2019 24\u201c Pisces, with latitude 5\u00b0 52\u2019 15\u201c south. It was decreasing precipitously. For before August 10 it was maximum, fourteen days before opposition. The motion for the five days was 1\u00b0 22\u2019 36\u201c, and for one day, 16\u2019 31\u201c. The sun\u2019s position on August 24 at 10\u00bdh was 11\u00b0 2\u2019 31\u201c Virgo. The stars were 1\u00b0 35\u2019 30\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 58\u2019 20\u201c. The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 14\u2019 51\u201c. This requires 1 day 6 hours 57 min. until opposition, so that this will be August 26 at 5h 27m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 12\u00b0 16\u2019 Pisces. Its latitude was 6\u00b0 2\u2019 south, approximately, if the horizontal variations do indeed cancel.","1618":"On the night following 1589 April 15 at 12h 5m, the planet was found at 3\u00b0 58\u2019 20\u201c Scorpio,13 with latitude 1\u00b0 4\u2019 20\u201c north, decreasing. Mars\u2019s altitude was 22\u2155\u00b0, where refraction from the table for the fixed stars was zero, and from the table for the sun, 3\u00bd\u2019. But the parallax was about twice as great as the sun\u2019s, that is, 6 minutes at the horizon. The degree rising was 24\u00b0 Sagittarius. Therefore, the nonagesimal was 64\u00b0 from the zenith, giving a diurnal latitudinal parallax of 5\u2019 24\u201c. Whether it really was that much will become apparent below, through a careful consideration of latitudes ^14.

As this is to 24 hours, so is 1\u00b0 39\u2019 20\u201c to 1 day 5 hours 42 minutes. Therefore, the moment of opposition was April 14 at 6h 23m PM.

The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 57\u2019 8\u201c, and Mars\u2019s (for four days) was 1\u00b0 12\u2019 24\u201c, since on June 10 at 11h 50m it was at 26\u00b0 2\u2019 18\u201c Sagittarius. For one day, therefore, 18\u2019 12\u201c. The sum of the diurnal motions is 1\u00b0 15\u2019 20\u201c. This corresponds to 1 day 19 hours 24 minutes, which, added to the 6th at 12h 20m (because opposition was yet to come), shows [the moment of opposition to be] the 8th at 7h 43m. Mars\u2019s position was 26\u00b0 41\u2019 48\u201c Sagittarius, to which are added 52\u201c for reduction to the orbit, so as to make it about 26\u00b0 43\u2019 Sagittarius. The latitude was six minutes greater than on 6 June, because, by the observations, the latitude here was increasing until the fortieth day after opposition, and increased nearly thirteen minutes between the 6th and the 10th of June. Therefore, ignoring parallax and keeping the same refraction, it would be 4\u00b0 1\u00bd\u2019 ^17. VII. On 1593 August 24 at 10h 30m, the ecliptic position of Mars was found  to be 12\u00b0 38\u2019 Pisces,18 with latitude 6\u00b0 5\u2019 30\u201c south. The altitude was great enough that horizontal variations canceled one another. On the August 29th following, at 10h 20m, Mars was observed at 11\u00b0 15\u2019 24\u201c Pisces, with latitude 5\u00b0 52\u2019 15\u201c south. It was decreasing precipitously. For before August 10 it was maximum, fourteen days before opposition. The motion for the five days was 1\u00b0 22\u2019 36\u201c, and for one day, 16\u2019 31\u201c. The sun\u2019s position on August 24 at 10\u00bdh was 11\u00b0 2\u2019 31\u201c Virgo. The stars were 1\u00b0 35\u2019 30\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 58\u2019 20\u201c. The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 14\u2019 51\u201c. This requires 1 day 6 hours 57 min. until opposition, so that this will be August 26 at 5h 27m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 12\u00b0 16\u2019 Pisces. Its latitude was 6\u00b0 2\u2019 south, approximately, if the horizontal variations do indeed cancel.","1621":"On the night following 1589 April 15 at 12h 5m, the planet was found at 3\u00b0 58\u2019 20\u201c Scorpio,13 with latitude 1\u00b0 4\u2019 20\u201c north, decreasing. Mars\u2019s altitude was 22\u2155\u00b0, where refraction from the table for the fixed stars was zero, and from the table for the sun, 3\u00bd\u2019. But the parallax was about twice as great as the sun\u2019s, that is, 6 minutes at the horizon. The degree rising was 24\u00b0 Sagittarius. Therefore, the nonagesimal was 64\u00b0 from the zenith, giving a diurnal latitudinal parallax of 5\u2019 24\u201c. Whether it really was that much will become apparent below, through a careful consideration of latitudes ^14. For there, the northern latitude, free from diurnal parallax (and if there is no refraction), would come out to be 1\u00b0 9\u2019 45\u201c north. And because the altitude of the nonagesimal is 26\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax15 at the horizon is 2\u2019 38\u201c. But Mars is 40\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, counting from 4\u00b0 Scorpio to 24\u00b0 Virgo, which, under the column  headed 2\u2019 38\u201c shows a true longitudinal parallax of 1\u2019 42\u201c. That hastens Mars further forward than when viewed from the center of the earth, and this is so on the assumption that it underwent no refraction. But to me it is more probable that it undergoes the same refraction as the sun, greater, that is, than that of the fixed stars, because the opposition of the sun and Mars stirs up the air, while the fixed stars are observed when the air is as calm as possible. Still, let there be no refraction at all, and let Mars be placed at 3\u00b0 57\u2019 Scorpio. At that moment the sun was at 5\u00b0 36\u2019 20\u201c Taurus. At this time, therefore, Mars was 1\u00b0 39\u2019 20\u201c past opposition to the sun. Mars\u2019s diurnal motion, as is clear from comparison with April 13, is 22\u2019 8\u201c; the sun\u2019s, 58\u2019 10\u201c; the sum, 1\u00b0 20\u2019 18\u201c. As this is to 24 hours, so is 1\u00b0 39\u2019 20\u201c to 1 day 5 hours 42 minutes. Therefore, the moment of opposition was April 14 at 6h 23m PM. Its position was 4\u00b0 24\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio, or a little past, if refraction were applied or if the previously assumed value for the diurnal parallax was too great. For reduction to the orbit, some imperceptible quantity must be subtracted, since it is barely 12 degrees from the node. This would be about 24 seconds, which are of no importance, and Mars would be at 4\u00b0 24\u2019 Scorpio, with latitude three minutes greater than before. For from that position, the latitude was decreasing from the eighth of March; nor was it a maximum at opposition.\nVI. On the night following 1591 June 6 at 12h 20m, Mars was found at 27\u00b0 14\u2019 42\u201c Sagittarius,16 with latitude 3\u00b0 55\u00bd\u2019 south. Refraction was of course provided for (from the table for the fixed stars), since it was large, in that Mars had no more than 6\u00b0 altitude on the meridian. There was, however, no mention of parallax. But at that time Mars was distant from the earth by half the solar distance. Therefore, the horizontal parallax is greater than 6 minutes, on the supposition that the sun\u2019s parallax is 3\u2019. I omit it nonetheless, partly because the refraction is supplied from the table for the sun (which, as I said, is the more probable), exceeding that which Brahe took here by 4\u00bd\u2019, which almost completely cancels out the parallax; and partly because Mars was on the meridian and near the winter solstice point, and thus had no longitudinal parallax. Of the latitude, on the other hand, it will have to be seen below in Part IV whether it might not be a few minutes less, since the parallax projects the planet too far south.\nThe sun was at 24\u00b0 58\u2019 10\u201c Gemini.

The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 57\u2019 8\u201c, and Mars\u2019s (for four days) was 1\u00b0 12\u2019 24\u201c, since on June 10 at 11h 50m it was at 26\u00b0 2\u2019 18\u201c Sagittarius. For one day, therefore, 18\u2019 12\u201c. The sum of the diurnal motions is 1\u00b0 15\u2019 20\u201c. This corresponds to 1 day 19 hours 24 minutes, which, added to the 6th at 12h 20m (because opposition was yet to come), shows [the moment of opposition to be] the 8th at 7h 43m.

Mars\u2019s altitude was 22\u2155\u00b0, where refraction from the table for the fixed stars was zero, and from the table for the sun, 3\u00bd\u2019. But the parallax was about twice as great as the sun\u2019s, that is, 6 minutes at the horizon. The degree rising was 24\u00b0 Sagittarius. Therefore, the nonagesimal was 64\u00b0 from the zenith, giving a diurnal latitudinal parallax of 5\u2019 24\u201c. Whether it really was that much will become apparent below, through a careful consideration of latitudes ^14. For there, the northern latitude, free from diurnal parallax (and if there is no refraction), would come out to be 1\u00b0 9\u2019 45\u201c north. And because the altitude of the nonagesimal is 26\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax15 at the horizon is 2\u2019 38\u201c. But Mars is 40\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, counting from 4\u00b0 Scorpio to 24\u00b0 Virgo, which, under the column  headed 2\u2019 38\u201c shows a true longitudinal parallax of 1\u2019 42\u201c. That hastens Mars further forward than when viewed from the center of the earth, and this is so on the assumption that it underwent no refraction. But to me it is more probable that it undergoes the same refraction as the sun, greater, that is, than that of the fixed stars, because the opposition of the sun and Mars stirs up the air, while the fixed stars are observed when the air is as calm as possible. Still, let there be no refraction at all, and let Mars be placed at 3\u00b0 57\u2019 Scorpio. At that moment the sun was at 5\u00b0 36\u2019 20\u201c Taurus. At this time, therefore, Mars was 1\u00b0 39\u2019 20\u201c past opposition to the sun. Mars\u2019s diurnal motion, as is clear from comparison with April 13, is 22\u2019 8\u201c; the sun\u2019s, 58\u2019 10\u201c; the sum, 1\u00b0 20\u2019 18\u201c. As this is to 24 hours, so is 1\u00b0 39\u2019 20\u201c to 1 day 5 hours 42 minutes. Therefore, the moment of opposition was April 14 at 6h 23m PM. Its position was 4\u00b0 24\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio, or a little past, if refraction were applied or if the previously assumed value for the diurnal parallax was too great. For reduction to the orbit, some imperceptible quantity must be subtracted, since it is barely 12 degrees from the node. This would be about 24 seconds, which are of no importance, and Mars would be at 4\u00b0 24\u2019 Scorpio, with latitude three minutes greater than before. For from that position, the latitude was decreasing from the eighth of March; nor was it a maximum at opposition.\nVI. On the night following 1591 June 6 at 12h 20m, Mars was found at 27\u00b0 14\u2019 42\u201c Sagittarius,16 with latitude 3\u00b0 55\u00bd\u2019 south. Refraction was of course provided for (from the table for the fixed stars), since it was large, in that Mars had no more than 6\u00b0 altitude on the meridian. There was, however, no mention of parallax. But at that time Mars was distant from the earth by half the solar distance. Therefore, the horizontal parallax is greater than 6 minutes, on the supposition that the sun\u2019s parallax is 3\u2019. I omit it nonetheless, partly because the refraction is supplied from the table for the sun (which, as I said, is the more probable), exceeding that which Brahe took here by 4\u00bd\u2019, which almost completely cancels out the parallax; and partly because Mars was on the meridian and near the winter solstice point, and thus had no longitudinal parallax. Of the latitude, on the other hand, it will have to be seen below in Part IV whether it might not be a few minutes less, since the parallax projects the planet too far south.\nThe sun was at 24\u00b0 58\u2019 10\u201c Gemini. The difference in position between the stars was 2\u00b0 16\u2019 10\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 57\u2019 8\u201c, and Mars\u2019s (for four days) was 1\u00b0 12\u2019 24\u201c, since on June 10 at 11h 50m it was at 26\u00b0 2\u2019 18\u201c Sagittarius. For one day, therefore, 18\u2019 12\u201c. The sum of the diurnal motions is 1\u00b0 15\u2019 20\u201c. This corresponds to 1 day 19 hours 24 minutes, which, added to the 6th at 12h 20m (because opposition was yet to come), shows [the moment of opposition to be] the 8th at 7h 43m. Mars\u2019s position was 26\u00b0 41\u2019 48\u201c Sagittarius, to which are added 52\u201c for reduction to the orbit, so as to make it about 26\u00b0 43\u2019 Sagittarius. The latitude was six minutes greater than on 6 June, because, by the observations, the latitude here was increasing until the fortieth day after opposition, and increased nearly thirteen minutes between the 6th and the 10th of June. Therefore, ignoring parallax and keeping the same refraction, it would be 4\u00b0 1\u00bd\u2019 ^17. VII. On 1593 August 24 at 10h 30m, the ecliptic position of Mars was found  to be 12\u00b0 38\u2019 Pisces,18 with latitude 6\u00b0 5\u2019 30\u201c south. The altitude was great enough that horizontal variations canceled one another. On the August 29th following, at 10h 20m, Mars was observed at 11\u00b0 15\u2019 24\u201c Pisces, with latitude 5\u00b0 52\u2019 15\u201c south. It was decreasing precipitously. For before August 10 it was maximum, fourteen days before opposition. The motion for the five days was 1\u00b0 22\u2019 36\u201c, and for one day, 16\u2019 31\u201c. The sun\u2019s position on August 24 at 10\u00bdh was 11\u00b0 2\u2019 31\u201c Virgo. The stars were 1\u00b0 35\u2019 30\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 58\u2019 20\u201c. The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 14\u2019 51\u201c. This requires 1 day 6 hours 57 min. until opposition, so that this will be August 26 at 5h 27m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 12\u00b0 16\u2019 Pisces. Its latitude was 6\u00b0 2\u2019 south, approximately, if the horizontal variations do indeed cancel.","1625":"On the night following 1589 April 15 at 12h 5m, the planet was found at 3\u00b0 58\u2019 20\u201c Scorpio,13 with latitude 1\u00b0 4\u2019 20\u201c north, decreasing.

As this is to 24 hours, so is 1\u00b0 39\u2019 20\u201c to 1 day 5 hours 42 minutes. Therefore, the moment of opposition was April 14 at 6h 23m PM.

Refraction was of course provided for (from the table for the fixed stars), since it was large, in that Mars had no more than 6\u00b0 altitude on the meridian. There was, however, no mention of parallax. But at that time Mars was distant from the earth by half the solar distance. Therefore, the horizontal parallax is greater than 6 minutes, on the supposition that the sun\u2019s parallax is 3\u2019. I omit it nonetheless, partly because the refraction is supplied from the table for the sun (which, as I said, is the more probable), exceeding that which Brahe took here by 4\u00bd\u2019, which almost completely cancels out the parallax; and partly because Mars was on the meridian and near the winter solstice point, and thus had no longitudinal parallax. Of the latitude, on the other hand, it will have to be seen below in Part IV whether it might not be a few minutes less, since the parallax projects the planet too far south.\nThe sun was at 24\u00b0 58\u2019 10\u201c Gemini. The difference in position between the stars was 2\u00b0 16\u2019 10\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 57\u2019 8\u201c, and Mars\u2019s (for four days) was 1\u00b0 12\u2019 24\u201c, since on June 10 at 11h 50m it was at 26\u00b0 2\u2019 18\u201c Sagittarius. For one day, therefore, 18\u2019 12\u201c. The sum of the diurnal motions is 1\u00b0 15\u2019 20\u201c. This corresponds to 1 day 19 hours 24 minutes, which, added to the 6th at 12h 20m (because opposition was yet to come), shows [the moment of opposition to be] the 8th at 7h 43m. Mars\u2019s position was 26\u00b0 41\u2019 48\u201c Sagittarius, to which are added 52\u201c for reduction to the orbit, so as to make it about 26\u00b0 43\u2019 Sagittarius. The latitude was six minutes greater than on 6 June, because, by the observations, the latitude here was increasing until the fortieth day after opposition, and increased nearly thirteen minutes between the 6th and the 10th of June. Therefore, ignoring parallax and keeping the same refraction, it would be 4\u00b0 1\u00bd\u2019 ^17. VII. On 1593 August 24 at 10h 30m, the ecliptic position of Mars was found  to be 12\u00b0 38\u2019 Pisces,18 with latitude 6\u00b0 5\u2019 30\u201c south. The altitude was great enough that horizontal variations canceled one another. On the August 29th following, at 10h 20m, Mars was observed at 11\u00b0 15\u2019 24\u201c Pisces, with latitude 5\u00b0 52\u2019 15\u201c south. It was decreasing precipitously. For before August 10 it was maximum, fourteen days before opposition. The motion for the five days was 1\u00b0 22\u2019 36\u201c, and for one day, 16\u2019 31\u201c. The sun\u2019s position on August 24 at 10\u00bdh was 11\u00b0 2\u2019 31\u201c Virgo. The stars were 1\u00b0 35\u2019 30\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 58\u2019 20\u201c. The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 14\u2019 51\u201c. This requires 1 day 6 hours 57 min. until opposition, so that this will be August 26 at 5h 27m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 12\u00b0 16\u2019 Pisces. Its latitude was 6\u00b0 2\u2019 south, approximately, if the horizontal variations do indeed cancel.","1628":"On the night following 1589 April 15 at 12h 5m, the planet was found at 3\u00b0 58\u2019 20\u201c Scorpio,13 with latitude 1\u00b0 4\u2019 20\u201c north, decreasing. Mars\u2019s altitude was 22\u2155\u00b0, where refraction from the table for the fixed stars was zero, and from the table for the sun, 3\u00bd\u2019. But the parallax was about twice as great as the sun\u2019s, that is, 6 minutes at the horizon. The degree rising was 24\u00b0 Sagittarius. Therefore, the nonagesimal was 64\u00b0 from the zenith, giving a diurnal latitudinal parallax of 5\u2019 24\u201c. Whether it really was that much will become apparent below, through a careful consideration of latitudes ^14. For there, the northern latitude, free from diurnal parallax (and if there is no refraction), would come out to be 1\u00b0 9\u2019 45\u201c north. And because the altitude of the nonagesimal is 26\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax15 at the horizon is 2\u2019 38\u201c. But Mars is 40\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, counting from 4\u00b0 Scorpio to 24\u00b0 Virgo, which, under the column  headed 2\u2019 38\u201c shows a true longitudinal parallax of 1\u2019 42\u201c. That hastens Mars further forward than when viewed from the center of the earth, and this is so on the assumption that it underwent no refraction. But to me it is more probable that it undergoes the same refraction as the sun, greater, that is, than that of the fixed stars, because the opposition of the sun and Mars stirs up the air, while the fixed stars are observed when the air is as calm as possible. Still, let there be no refraction at all, and let Mars be placed at 3\u00b0 57\u2019 Scorpio. At that moment the sun was at 5\u00b0 36\u2019 20\u201c Taurus. At this time, therefore, Mars was 1\u00b0 39\u2019 20\u201c past opposition to the sun. Mars\u2019s diurnal motion, as is clear from comparison with April 13, is 22\u2019 8\u201c; the sun\u2019s, 58\u2019 10\u201c; the sum, 1\u00b0 20\u2019 18\u201c. As this is to 24 hours, so is 1\u00b0 39\u2019 20\u201c to 1 day 5 hours 42 minutes. Therefore, the moment of opposition was April 14 at 6h 23m PM. Its position was 4\u00b0 24\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio, or a little past, if refraction were applied or if the previously assumed value for the diurnal parallax was too great. For reduction to the orbit, some imperceptible quantity must be subtracted, since it is barely 12 degrees from the node. This would be about 24 seconds, which are of no importance, and Mars would be at 4\u00b0 24\u2019 Scorpio, with latitude three minutes greater than before. For from that position, the latitude was decreasing from the eighth of March; nor was it a maximum at opposition.\nVI.

The sun\u2019s position on August 24 at 10\u00bdh was 11\u00b0 2\u2019 31\u201c Virgo. The stars were 1\u00b0 35\u2019 30\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 58\u2019 20\u201c. The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 14\u2019 51\u201c. This requires 1 day 6 hours 57 min. until opposition, so that this will be August 26 at 5h 27m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 12\u00b0 16\u2019 Pisces. Its latitude was 6\u00b0 2\u2019 south, approximately, if the horizontal variations do indeed cancel.","1631":"On the night following 1589 April 15 at 12h 5m, the planet was found at 3\u00b0 58\u2019 20\u201c Scorpio,13 with latitude 1\u00b0 4\u2019 20\u201c north, decreasing. Mars\u2019s altitude was 22\u2155\u00b0, where refraction from the table for the fixed stars was zero, and from the table for the sun, 3\u00bd\u2019. But the parallax was about twice as great as the sun\u2019s, that is, 6 minutes at the horizon. The degree rising was 24\u00b0 Sagittarius. Therefore, the nonagesimal was 64\u00b0 from the zenith, giving a diurnal latitudinal parallax of 5\u2019 24\u201c. Whether it really was that much will become apparent below, through a careful consideration of latitudes ^14. For there, the northern latitude, free from diurnal parallax (and if there is no refraction), would come out to be 1\u00b0 9\u2019 45\u201c north. And because the altitude of the nonagesimal is 26\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax15 at the horizon is 2\u2019 38\u201c. But Mars is 40\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, counting from 4\u00b0 Scorpio to 24\u00b0 Virgo, which, under the column  headed 2\u2019 38\u201c shows a true longitudinal parallax of 1\u2019 42\u201c. That hastens Mars further forward than when viewed from the center of the earth, and this is so on the assumption that it underwent no refraction. But to me it is more probable that it undergoes the same refraction as the sun, greater, that is, than that of the fixed stars, because the opposition of the sun and Mars stirs up the air, while the fixed stars are observed when the air is as calm as possible. Still, let there be no refraction at all, and let Mars be placed at 3\u00b0 57\u2019 Scorpio. At that moment the sun was at 5\u00b0 36\u2019 20\u201c Taurus. At this time, therefore, Mars was 1\u00b0 39\u2019 20\u201c past opposition to the sun. Mars\u2019s diurnal motion, as is clear from comparison with April 13, is 22\u2019 8\u201c; the sun\u2019s, 58\u2019 10\u201c; the sum, 1\u00b0 20\u2019 18\u201c. As this is to 24 hours, so is 1\u00b0 39\u2019 20\u201c to 1 day 5 hours 42 minutes. Therefore, the moment of opposition was April 14 at 6h 23m PM. Its position was 4\u00b0 24\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio, or a little past, if refraction were applied or if the previously assumed value for the diurnal parallax was too great. For reduction to the orbit, some imperceptible quantity must be subtracted, since it is barely 12 degrees from the node. This would be about 24 seconds, which are of no importance, and Mars would be at 4\u00b0 24\u2019 Scorpio, with latitude three minutes greater than before. For from that position, the latitude was decreasing from the eighth of March; nor was it a maximum at opposition.\nVI. On the night following 1591 June 6 at 12h 20m, Mars was found at 27\u00b0 14\u2019 42\u201c Sagittarius,16 with latitude 3\u00b0 55\u00bd\u2019 south. Refraction was of course provided for (from the table for the fixed stars), since it was large, in that Mars had no more than 6\u00b0 altitude on the meridian. There was, however, no mention of parallax. But at that time Mars was distant from the earth by half the solar distance. Therefore, the horizontal parallax is greater than 6 minutes, on the supposition that the sun\u2019s parallax is 3\u2019. I omit it nonetheless, partly because the refraction is supplied from the table for the sun (which, as I said, is the more probable), exceeding that which Brahe took here by 4\u00bd\u2019, which almost completely cancels out the parallax; and partly because Mars was on the meridian and near the winter solstice point, and thus had no longitudinal parallax. Of the latitude, on the other hand, it will have to be seen below in Part IV whether it might not be a few minutes less, since the parallax projects the planet too far south.\nThe sun was at 24\u00b0 58\u2019 10\u201c Gemini. The difference in position between the stars was 2\u00b0 16\u2019 10\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 57\u2019 8\u201c, and Mars\u2019s (for four days) was 1\u00b0 12\u2019 24\u201c, since on June 10 at 11h 50m it was at 26\u00b0 2\u2019 18\u201c Sagittarius. For one day, therefore, 18\u2019 12\u201c. The sum of the diurnal motions is 1\u00b0 15\u2019 20\u201c. This corresponds to 1 day 19 hours 24 minutes, which, added to the 6th at 12h 20m (because opposition was yet to come), shows [the moment of opposition to be] the 8th at 7h 43m. Mars\u2019s position was 26\u00b0 41\u2019 48\u201c Sagittarius, to which are added 52\u201c for reduction to the orbit, so as to make it about 26\u00b0 43\u2019 Sagittarius. The latitude was six minutes greater than on 6 June, because, by the observations, the latitude here was increasing until the fortieth day after opposition, and increased nearly thirteen minutes between the 6th and the 10th of June. Therefore, ignoring parallax and keeping the same refraction, it would be 4\u00b0 1\u00bd\u2019 ^17. VII. On 1593 August 24 at 10h 30m, the ecliptic position of Mars was found  to be 12\u00b0 38\u2019 Pisces,18 with latitude 6\u00b0 5\u2019 30\u201c south. The altitude was great enough that horizontal variations canceled one another. On the August 29th following, at 10h 20m, Mars was observed at 11\u00b0 15\u2019 24\u201c Pisces, with latitude 5\u00b0 52\u2019 15\u201c south. It was decreasing precipitously.

As this is to 24 hours, so is 1\u00b0 39\u2019 20\u201c to 1 day 5 hours 42 minutes. Therefore, the moment of opposition was April 14 at 6h 23m PM.

Mars\u2019s diurnal motion, as is clear from comparison with April 13, is 22\u2019 8\u201c; the sun\u2019s, 58\u2019 10\u201c; the sum, 1\u00b0 20\u2019 18\u201c. As this is to 24 hours, so is 1\u00b0 39\u2019 20\u201c to 1 day 5 hours 42 minutes. Therefore, the moment of opposition was April 14 at 6h 23m PM. Its position was 4\u00b0 24\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio, or a little past, if refraction were applied or if the previously assumed value for the diurnal parallax was too great. For reduction to the orbit, some imperceptible quantity must be subtracted, since it is barely 12 degrees from the node. This would be about 24 seconds, which are of no importance, and Mars would be at 4\u00b0 24\u2019 Scorpio, with latitude three minutes greater than before. For from that position, the latitude was decreasing from the eighth of March; nor was it a maximum at opposition.\nVI. On the night following 1591 June 6 at 12h 20m, Mars was found at 27\u00b0 14\u2019 42\u201c Sagittarius,16 with latitude 3\u00b0 55\u00bd\u2019 south. Refraction was of course provided for (from the table for the fixed stars), since it was large, in that Mars had no more than 6\u00b0 altitude on the meridian. There was, however, no mention of parallax. But at that time Mars was distant from the earth by half the solar distance. Therefore, the horizontal parallax is greater than 6 minutes, on the supposition that the sun\u2019s parallax is 3\u2019. I omit it nonetheless, partly because the refraction is supplied from the table for the sun (which, as I said, is the more probable), exceeding that which Brahe took here by 4\u00bd\u2019, which almost completely cancels out the parallax; and partly because Mars was on the meridian and near the winter solstice point, and thus had no longitudinal parallax. Of the latitude, on the other hand, it will have to be seen below in Part IV whether it might not be a few minutes less, since the parallax projects the planet too far south.\nThe sun was at 24\u00b0 58\u2019 10\u201c Gemini. The difference in position between the stars was 2\u00b0 16\u2019 10\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 57\u2019 8\u201c, and Mars\u2019s (for four days) was 1\u00b0 12\u2019 24\u201c, since on June 10 at 11h 50m it was at 26\u00b0 2\u2019 18\u201c Sagittarius. For one day, therefore, 18\u2019 12\u201c. The sum of the diurnal motions is 1\u00b0 15\u2019 20\u201c. This corresponds to 1 day 19 hours 24 minutes, which, added to the 6th at 12h 20m (because opposition was yet to come), shows [the moment of opposition to be] the 8th at 7h 43m. Mars\u2019s position was 26\u00b0 41\u2019 48\u201c Sagittarius, to which are added 52\u201c for reduction to the orbit, so as to make it about 26\u00b0 43\u2019 Sagittarius. The latitude was six minutes greater than on 6 June, because, by the observations, the latitude here was increasing until the fortieth day after opposition, and increased nearly thirteen minutes between the 6th and the 10th of June. Therefore, ignoring parallax and keeping the same refraction, it would be 4\u00b0 1\u00bd\u2019 ^17. VII. On 1593 August 24 at 10h 30m, the ecliptic position of Mars was found  to be 12\u00b0 38\u2019 Pisces,18 with latitude 6\u00b0 5\u2019 30\u201c south. The altitude was great enough that horizontal variations canceled one another. On the August 29th following, at 10h 20m, Mars was observed at 11\u00b0 15\u2019 24\u201c Pisces, with latitude 5\u00b0 52\u2019 15\u201c south. It was decreasing precipitously. For before August 10 it was maximum, fourteen days before opposition. The motion for the five days was 1\u00b0 22\u2019 36\u201c, and for one day, 16\u2019 31\u201c. The sun\u2019s position on August 24 at 10\u00bdh was 11\u00b0 2\u2019 31\u201c Virgo. The stars were 1\u00b0 35\u2019 30\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 58\u2019 20\u201c. The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 14\u2019 51\u201c. This requires 1 day 6 hours 57 min. until opposition, so that this will be August 26 at 5h 27m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 12\u00b0 16\u2019 Pisces. Its latitude was 6\u00b0 2\u2019 south, approximately, if the horizontal variations do indeed cancel.","1635":"On the night following 1589 April 15 at 12h 5m, the planet was found at 3\u00b0 58\u2019 20\u201c Scorpio,13 with latitude 1\u00b0 4\u2019 20\u201c north, decreasing. Mars\u2019s altitude was 22\u2155\u00b0, where refraction from the table for the fixed stars was zero, and from the table for the sun, 3\u00bd\u2019. But the parallax was about twice as great as the sun\u2019s, that is, 6 minutes at the horizon. The degree rising was 24\u00b0 Sagittarius. Therefore, the nonagesimal was 64\u00b0 from the zenith, giving a diurnal latitudinal parallax of 5\u2019 24\u201c. Whether it really was that much will become apparent below, through a careful consideration of latitudes ^14. For there, the northern latitude, free from diurnal parallax (and if there is no refraction), would come out to be 1\u00b0 9\u2019 45\u201c north. And because the altitude of the nonagesimal is 26\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax15 at the horizon is 2\u2019 38\u201c. But Mars is 40\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, counting from 4\u00b0 Scorpio to 24\u00b0 Virgo, which, under the column  headed 2\u2019 38\u201c shows a true longitudinal parallax of 1\u2019 42\u201c. That hastens Mars further forward than when viewed from the center of the earth, and this is so on the assumption that it underwent no refraction. But to me it is more probable that it undergoes the same refraction as the sun, greater, that is, than that of the fixed stars, because the opposition of the sun and Mars stirs up the air, while the fixed stars are observed when the air is as calm as possible. Still, let there be no refraction at all, and let Mars be placed at 3\u00b0 57\u2019 Scorpio. At that moment the sun was at 5\u00b0 36\u2019 20\u201c Taurus.

As this is to 24 hours, so is 1\u00b0 39\u2019 20\u201c to 1 day 5 hours 42 minutes. Therefore, the moment of opposition was April 14 at 6h 23m PM. Its position was 4\u00b0 24\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio, or a little past, if refraction were applied or if the previously assumed value for the diurnal parallax was too great.

For one day, therefore, 18\u2019 12\u201c. The sum of the diurnal motions is 1\u00b0 15\u2019 20\u201c.

The latitude was six minutes greater than on 6 June, because, by the observations, the latitude here was increasing until the fortieth day after opposition, and increased nearly thirteen minutes between the 6th and the 10th of June. Therefore, ignoring parallax and keeping the same refraction, it would be 4\u00b0 1\u00bd\u2019 ^17. VII. On 1593 August 24 at 10h 30m, the ecliptic position of Mars was found  to be 12\u00b0 38\u2019 Pisces,18 with latitude 6\u00b0 5\u2019 30\u201c south. The altitude was great enough that horizontal variations canceled one another. On the August 29th following, at 10h 20m, Mars was observed at 11\u00b0 15\u2019 24\u201c Pisces, with latitude 5\u00b0 52\u2019 15\u201c south. It was decreasing precipitously. For before August 10 it was maximum, fourteen days before opposition. The motion for the five days was 1\u00b0 22\u2019 36\u201c, and for one day, 16\u2019 31\u201c. The sun\u2019s position on August 24 at 10\u00bdh was 11\u00b0 2\u2019 31\u201c Virgo. The stars were 1\u00b0 35\u2019 30\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 58\u2019 20\u201c. The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 14\u2019 51\u201c. This requires 1 day 6 hours 57 min. until opposition, so that this will be August 26 at 5h 27m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 12\u00b0 16\u2019 Pisces. Its latitude was 6\u00b0 2\u2019 south, approximately, if the horizontal variations do indeed cancel.","1638":"On the night following 1589 April 15 at 12h 5m, the planet was found at 3\u00b0 58\u2019 20\u201c Scorpio,13 with latitude 1\u00b0 4\u2019 20\u201c north, decreasing. Mars\u2019s altitude was 22\u2155\u00b0, where refraction from the table for the fixed stars was zero, and from the table for the sun, 3\u00bd\u2019. But the parallax was about twice as great as the sun\u2019s, that is, 6 minutes at the horizon. The degree rising was 24\u00b0 Sagittarius. Therefore, the nonagesimal was 64\u00b0 from the zenith, giving a diurnal latitudinal parallax of 5\u2019 24\u201c. Whether it really was that much will become apparent below, through a careful consideration of latitudes ^14. For there, the northern latitude, free from diurnal parallax (and if there is no refraction), would come out to be 1\u00b0 9\u2019 45\u201c north. And because the altitude of the nonagesimal is 26\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax15 at the horizon is 2\u2019 38\u201c. But Mars is 40\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, counting from 4\u00b0 Scorpio to 24\u00b0 Virgo, which, under the column  headed 2\u2019 38\u201c shows a true longitudinal parallax of 1\u2019 42\u201c. That hastens Mars further forward than when viewed from the center of the earth, and this is so on the assumption that it underwent no refraction. But to me it is more probable that it undergoes the same refraction as the sun, greater, that is, than that of the fixed stars, because the opposition of the sun and Mars stirs up the air, while the fixed stars are observed when the air is as calm as possible. Still, let there be no refraction at all, and let Mars be placed at 3\u00b0 57\u2019 Scorpio. At that moment the sun was at 5\u00b0 36\u2019 20\u201c Taurus. At this time, therefore, Mars was 1\u00b0 39\u2019 20\u201c past opposition to the sun. Mars\u2019s diurnal motion, as is clear from comparison with April 13, is 22\u2019 8\u201c; the sun\u2019s, 58\u2019 10\u201c; the sum, 1\u00b0 20\u2019 18\u201c. As this is to 24 hours, so is 1\u00b0 39\u2019 20\u201c to 1 day 5 hours 42 minutes. Therefore, the moment of opposition was April 14 at 6h 23m PM. Its position was 4\u00b0 24\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio, or a little past, if refraction were applied or if the previously assumed value for the diurnal parallax was too great. For reduction to the orbit, some imperceptible quantity must be subtracted, since it is barely 12 degrees from the node. This would be about 24 seconds, which are of no importance, and Mars would be at 4\u00b0 24\u2019 Scorpio, with latitude three minutes greater than before. For from that position, the latitude was decreasing from the eighth of March; nor was it a maximum at opposition.\nVI. On the night following 1591 June 6 at 12h 20m, Mars was found at 27\u00b0 14\u2019 42\u201c Sagittarius,16 with latitude 3\u00b0 55\u00bd\u2019 south. Refraction was of course provided for (from the table for the fixed stars), since it was large, in that Mars had no more than 6\u00b0 altitude on the meridian. There was, however, no mention of parallax. But at that time Mars was distant from the earth by half the solar distance. Therefore, the horizontal parallax is greater than 6 minutes, on the supposition that the sun\u2019s parallax is 3\u2019. I omit it nonetheless, partly because the refraction is supplied from the table for the sun (which, as I said, is the more probable), exceeding that which Brahe took here by 4\u00bd\u2019, which almost completely cancels out the parallax; and partly because Mars was on the meridian and near the winter solstice point, and thus had no longitudinal parallax. Of the latitude, on the other hand, it will have to be seen below in Part IV whether it might not be a few minutes less, since the parallax projects the planet too far south.\nThe sun was at 24\u00b0 58\u2019 10\u201c Gemini. The difference in position between the stars was 2\u00b0 16\u2019 10\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 57\u2019 8\u201c, and Mars\u2019s (for four days) was 1\u00b0 12\u2019 24\u201c, since on June 10 at 11h 50m it was at 26\u00b0 2\u2019 18\u201c Sagittarius. For one day, therefore, 18\u2019 12\u201c. The sum of the diurnal motions is 1\u00b0 15\u2019 20\u201c. This corresponds to 1 day 19 hours 24 minutes, which, added to the 6th at 12h 20m (because opposition was yet to come), shows [the moment of opposition to be] the 8th at 7h 43m. Mars\u2019s position was 26\u00b0 41\u2019 48\u201c Sagittarius, to which are added 52\u201c for reduction to the orbit, so as to make it about 26\u00b0 43\u2019 Sagittarius.

But Mars is 40\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, counting from 4\u00b0 Scorpio to 24\u00b0 Virgo, which, under the column  headed 2\u2019 38\u201c shows a true longitudinal parallax of 1\u2019 42\u201c. That hastens Mars further forward than when viewed from the center of the earth, and this is so on the assumption that it underwent no refraction. But to me it is more probable that it undergoes the same refraction as the sun, greater, that is, than that of the fixed stars, because the opposition of the sun and Mars stirs up the air, while the fixed stars are observed when the air is as calm as possible. Still, let there be no refraction at all, and let Mars be placed at 3\u00b0 57\u2019 Scorpio. At that moment the sun was at 5\u00b0 36\u2019 20\u201c Taurus. At this time, therefore, Mars was 1\u00b0 39\u2019 20\u201c past opposition to the sun. Mars\u2019s diurnal motion, as is clear from comparison with April 13, is 22\u2019 8\u201c; the sun\u2019s, 58\u2019 10\u201c; the sum, 1\u00b0 20\u2019 18\u201c. As this is to 24 hours, so is 1\u00b0 39\u2019 20\u201c to 1 day 5 hours 42 minutes. Therefore, the moment of opposition was April 14 at 6h 23m PM. Its position was 4\u00b0 24\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio, or a little past, if refraction were applied or if the previously assumed value for the diurnal parallax was too great. For reduction to the orbit, some imperceptible quantity must be subtracted, since it is barely 12 degrees from the node. This would be about 24 seconds, which are of no importance, and Mars would be at 4\u00b0 24\u2019 Scorpio, with latitude three minutes greater than before. For from that position, the latitude was decreasing from the eighth of March; nor was it a maximum at opposition.\nVI. On the night following 1591 June 6 at 12h 20m, Mars was found at 27\u00b0 14\u2019 42\u201c Sagittarius,16 with latitude 3\u00b0 55\u00bd\u2019 south. Refraction was of course provided for (from the table for the fixed stars), since it was large, in that Mars had no more than 6\u00b0 altitude on the meridian. There was, however, no mention of parallax. But at that time Mars was distant from the earth by half the solar distance. Therefore, the horizontal parallax is greater than 6 minutes, on the supposition that the sun\u2019s parallax is 3\u2019. I omit it nonetheless, partly because the refraction is supplied from the table for the sun (which, as I said, is the more probable), exceeding that which Brahe took here by 4\u00bd\u2019, which almost completely cancels out the parallax; and partly because Mars was on the meridian and near the winter solstice point, and thus had no longitudinal parallax. Of the latitude, on the other hand, it will have to be seen below in Part IV whether it might not be a few minutes less, since the parallax projects the planet too far south.\nThe sun was at 24\u00b0 58\u2019 10\u201c Gemini. The difference in position between the stars was 2\u00b0 16\u2019 10\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 57\u2019 8\u201c, and Mars\u2019s (for four days) was 1\u00b0 12\u2019 24\u201c, since on June 10 at 11h 50m it was at 26\u00b0 2\u2019 18\u201c Sagittarius. For one day, therefore, 18\u2019 12\u201c. The sum of the diurnal motions is 1\u00b0 15\u2019 20\u201c. This corresponds to 1 day 19 hours 24 minutes, which, added to the 6th at 12h 20m (because opposition was yet to come), shows [the moment of opposition to be] the 8th at 7h 43m. Mars\u2019s position was 26\u00b0 41\u2019 48\u201c Sagittarius, to which are added 52\u201c for reduction to the orbit, so as to make it about 26\u00b0 43\u2019 Sagittarius. The latitude was six minutes greater than on 6 June, because, by the observations, the latitude here was increasing until the fortieth day after opposition, and increased nearly thirteen minutes between the 6th and the 10th of June. Therefore, ignoring parallax and keeping the same refraction, it would be 4\u00b0 1\u00bd\u2019 ^17. VII. On 1593 August 24 at 10h 30m, the ecliptic position of Mars was found  to be 12\u00b0 38\u2019 Pisces,18 with latitude 6\u00b0 5\u2019 30\u201c south. The altitude was great enough that horizontal variations canceled one another. On the August 29th following, at 10h 20m, Mars was observed at 11\u00b0 15\u2019 24\u201c Pisces, with latitude 5\u00b0 52\u2019 15\u201c south. It was decreasing precipitously. For before August 10 it was maximum, fourteen days before opposition. The motion for the five days was 1\u00b0 22\u2019 36\u201c, and for one day, 16\u2019 31\u201c. The sun\u2019s position on August 24 at 10\u00bdh was 11\u00b0 2\u2019 31\u201c Virgo. The stars were 1\u00b0 35\u2019 30\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 58\u2019 20\u201c. The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 14\u2019 51\u201c. This requires 1 day 6 hours 57 min. until opposition, so that this will be August 26 at 5h 27m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 12\u00b0 16\u2019 Pisces. Its latitude was 6\u00b0 2\u2019 south, approximately, if the horizontal variations do indeed cancel.","1642":"On the night following 1589 April 15 at 12h 5m, the planet was found at 3\u00b0 58\u2019 20\u201c Scorpio,13 with latitude 1\u00b0 4\u2019 20\u201c north, decreasing. Mars\u2019s altitude was 22\u2155\u00b0, where refraction from the table for the fixed stars was zero, and from the table for the sun, 3\u00bd\u2019. But the parallax was about twice as great as the sun\u2019s, that is, 6 minutes at the horizon. The degree rising was 24\u00b0 Sagittarius. Therefore, the nonagesimal was 64\u00b0 from the zenith, giving a diurnal latitudinal parallax of 5\u2019 24\u201c. Whether it really was that much will become apparent below, through a careful consideration of latitudes ^14. For there, the northern latitude, free from diurnal parallax (and if there is no refraction), would come out to be 1\u00b0 9\u2019 45\u201c north.

As this is to 24 hours, so is 1\u00b0 39\u2019 20\u201c to 1 day 5 hours 42 minutes. Therefore, the moment of opposition was April 14 at 6h 23m PM.

The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 57\u2019 8\u201c, and Mars\u2019s (for four days) was 1\u00b0 12\u2019 24\u201c, since on June 10 at 11h 50m it was at 26\u00b0 2\u2019 18\u201c Sagittarius. For one day, therefore, 18\u2019 12\u201c. The sum of the diurnal motions is 1\u00b0 15\u2019 20\u201c. This corresponds to 1 day 19 hours 24 minutes, which, added to the 6th at 12h 20m (because opposition was yet to come), shows [the moment of opposition to be] the 8th at 7h 43m. Mars\u2019s position was 26\u00b0 41\u2019 48\u201c Sagittarius, to which are added 52\u201c for reduction to the orbit, so as to make it about 26\u00b0 43\u2019 Sagittarius. The latitude was six minutes greater than on 6 June, because, by the observations, the latitude here was increasing until the fortieth day after opposition, and increased nearly thirteen minutes between the 6th and the 10th of June. Therefore, ignoring parallax and keeping the same refraction, it would be 4\u00b0 1\u00bd\u2019 ^17. VII. On 1593 August 24 at 10h 30m, the ecliptic position of Mars was found  to be 12\u00b0 38\u2019 Pisces,18 with latitude 6\u00b0 5\u2019 30\u201c south. The altitude was great enough that horizontal variations canceled one another. On the August 29th following, at 10h 20m, Mars was observed at 11\u00b0 15\u2019 24\u201c Pisces, with latitude 5\u00b0 52\u2019 15\u201c south. It was decreasing precipitously. For before August 10 it was maximum, fourteen days before opposition. The motion for the five days was 1\u00b0 22\u2019 36\u201c, and for one day, 16\u2019 31\u201c. The sun\u2019s position on August 24 at 10\u00bdh was 11\u00b0 2\u2019 31\u201c Virgo. The stars were 1\u00b0 35\u2019 30\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 58\u2019 20\u201c. The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 14\u2019 51\u201c. This requires 1 day 6 hours 57 min. until opposition, so that this will be August 26 at 5h 27m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 12\u00b0 16\u2019 Pisces. Its latitude was 6\u00b0 2\u2019 south, approximately, if the horizontal variations do indeed cancel.","1645":"On the night following 1589 April 15 at 12h 5m, the planet was found at 3\u00b0 58\u2019 20\u201c Scorpio,13 with latitude 1\u00b0 4\u2019 20\u201c north, decreasing. Mars\u2019s altitude was 22\u2155\u00b0, where refraction from the table for the fixed stars was zero, and from the table for the sun, 3\u00bd\u2019. But the parallax was about twice as great as the sun\u2019s, that is, 6 minutes at the horizon. The degree rising was 24\u00b0 Sagittarius. Therefore, the nonagesimal was 64\u00b0 from the zenith, giving a diurnal latitudinal parallax of 5\u2019 24\u201c. Whether it really was that much will become apparent below, through a careful consideration of latitudes ^14. For there, the northern latitude, free from diurnal parallax (and if there is no refraction), would come out to be 1\u00b0 9\u2019 45\u201c north. And because the altitude of the nonagesimal is 26\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax15 at the horizon is 2\u2019 38\u201c. But Mars is 40\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, counting from 4\u00b0 Scorpio to 24\u00b0 Virgo, which, under the column  headed 2\u2019 38\u201c shows a true longitudinal parallax of 1\u2019 42\u201c. That hastens Mars further forward than when viewed from the center of the earth, and this is so on the assumption that it underwent no refraction. But to me it is more probable that it undergoes the same refraction as the sun, greater, that is, than that of the fixed stars, because the opposition of the sun and Mars stirs up the air, while the fixed stars are observed when the air is as calm as possible. Still, let there be no refraction at all, and let Mars be placed at 3\u00b0 57\u2019 Scorpio. At that moment the sun was at 5\u00b0 36\u2019 20\u201c Taurus. At this time, therefore, Mars was 1\u00b0 39\u2019 20\u201c past opposition to the sun. Mars\u2019s diurnal motion, as is clear from comparison with April 13, is 22\u2019 8\u201c; the sun\u2019s, 58\u2019 10\u201c; the sum, 1\u00b0 20\u2019 18\u201c. As this is to 24 hours, so is 1\u00b0 39\u2019 20\u201c to 1 day 5 hours 42 minutes. Therefore, the moment of opposition was April 14 at 6h 23m PM. Its position was 4\u00b0 24\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio, or a little past, if refraction were applied or if the previously assumed value for the diurnal parallax was too great. For reduction to the orbit, some imperceptible quantity must be subtracted, since it is barely 12 degrees from the node. This would be about 24 seconds, which are of no importance, and Mars would be at 4\u00b0 24\u2019 Scorpio, with latitude three minutes greater than before. For from that position, the latitude was decreasing from the eighth of March; nor was it a maximum at opposition.\nVI. On the night following 1591 June 6 at 12h 20m, Mars was found at 27\u00b0 14\u2019 42\u201c Sagittarius,16 with latitude 3\u00b0 55\u00bd\u2019 south. Refraction was of course provided for (from the table for the fixed stars), since it was large, in that Mars had no more than 6\u00b0 altitude on the meridian. There was, however, no mention of parallax. But at that time Mars was distant from the earth by half the solar distance. Therefore, the horizontal parallax is greater than 6 minutes, on the supposition that the sun\u2019s parallax is 3\u2019. I omit it nonetheless, partly because the refraction is supplied from the table for the sun (which, as I said, is the more probable), exceeding that which Brahe took here by 4\u00bd\u2019, which almost completely cancels out the parallax; and partly because Mars was on the meridian and near the winter solstice point, and thus had no longitudinal parallax. Of the latitude, on the other hand, it will have to be seen below in Part IV whether it might not be a few minutes less, since the parallax projects the planet too far south.\nThe sun was at 24\u00b0 58\u2019 10\u201c Gemini.

The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 57\u2019 8\u201c, and Mars\u2019s (for four days) was 1\u00b0 12\u2019 24\u201c, since on June 10 at 11h 50m it was at 26\u00b0 2\u2019 18\u201c Sagittarius. For one day, therefore, 18\u2019 12\u201c. The sum of the diurnal motions is 1\u00b0 15\u2019 20\u201c. This corresponds to 1 day 19 hours 24 minutes, which, added to the 6th at 12h 20m (because opposition was yet to come), shows [the moment of opposition to be] the 8th at 7h 43m.

Mars\u2019s altitude was 22\u2155\u00b0, where refraction from the table for the fixed stars was zero, and from the table for the sun, 3\u00bd\u2019. But the parallax was about twice as great as the sun\u2019s, that is, 6 minutes at the horizon. The degree rising was 24\u00b0 Sagittarius. Therefore, the nonagesimal was 64\u00b0 from the zenith, giving a diurnal latitudinal parallax of 5\u2019 24\u201c. Whether it really was that much will become apparent below, through a careful consideration of latitudes ^14. For there, the northern latitude, free from diurnal parallax (and if there is no refraction), would come out to be 1\u00b0 9\u2019 45\u201c north. And because the altitude of the nonagesimal is 26\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax15 at the horizon is 2\u2019 38\u201c. But Mars is 40\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, counting from 4\u00b0 Scorpio to 24\u00b0 Virgo, which, under the column  headed 2\u2019 38\u201c shows a true longitudinal parallax of 1\u2019 42\u201c. That hastens Mars further forward than when viewed from the center of the earth, and this is so on the assumption that it underwent no refraction. But to me it is more probable that it undergoes the same refraction as the sun, greater, that is, than that of the fixed stars, because the opposition of the sun and Mars stirs up the air, while the fixed stars are observed when the air is as calm as possible. Still, let there be no refraction at all, and let Mars be placed at 3\u00b0 57\u2019 Scorpio. At that moment the sun was at 5\u00b0 36\u2019 20\u201c Taurus. At this time, therefore, Mars was 1\u00b0 39\u2019 20\u201c past opposition to the sun. Mars\u2019s diurnal motion, as is clear from comparison with April 13, is 22\u2019 8\u201c; the sun\u2019s, 58\u2019 10\u201c; the sum, 1\u00b0 20\u2019 18\u201c. As this is to 24 hours, so is 1\u00b0 39\u2019 20\u201c to 1 day 5 hours 42 minutes. Therefore, the moment of opposition was April 14 at 6h 23m PM. Its position was 4\u00b0 24\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio, or a little past, if refraction were applied or if the previously assumed value for the diurnal parallax was too great. For reduction to the orbit, some imperceptible quantity must be subtracted, since it is barely 12 degrees from the node. This would be about 24 seconds, which are of no importance, and Mars would be at 4\u00b0 24\u2019 Scorpio, with latitude three minutes greater than before. For from that position, the latitude was decreasing from the eighth of March; nor was it a maximum at opposition.\nVI. On the night following 1591 June 6 at 12h 20m, Mars was found at 27\u00b0 14\u2019 42\u201c Sagittarius,16 with latitude 3\u00b0 55\u00bd\u2019 south. Refraction was of course provided for (from the table for the fixed stars), since it was large, in that Mars had no more than 6\u00b0 altitude on the meridian. There was, however, no mention of parallax. But at that time Mars was distant from the earth by half the solar distance. Therefore, the horizontal parallax is greater than 6 minutes, on the supposition that the sun\u2019s parallax is 3\u2019. I omit it nonetheless, partly because the refraction is supplied from the table for the sun (which, as I said, is the more probable), exceeding that which Brahe took here by 4\u00bd\u2019, which almost completely cancels out the parallax; and partly because Mars was on the meridian and near the winter solstice point, and thus had no longitudinal parallax. Of the latitude, on the other hand, it will have to be seen below in Part IV whether it might not be a few minutes less, since the parallax projects the planet too far south.\nThe sun was at 24\u00b0 58\u2019 10\u201c Gemini. The difference in position between the stars was 2\u00b0 16\u2019 10\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 57\u2019 8\u201c, and Mars\u2019s (for four days) was 1\u00b0 12\u2019 24\u201c, since on June 10 at 11h 50m it was at 26\u00b0 2\u2019 18\u201c Sagittarius. For one day, therefore, 18\u2019 12\u201c. The sum of the diurnal motions is 1\u00b0 15\u2019 20\u201c. This corresponds to 1 day 19 hours 24 minutes, which, added to the 6th at 12h 20m (because opposition was yet to come), shows [the moment of opposition to be] the 8th at 7h 43m. Mars\u2019s position was 26\u00b0 41\u2019 48\u201c Sagittarius, to which are added 52\u201c for reduction to the orbit, so as to make it about 26\u00b0 43\u2019 Sagittarius. The latitude was six minutes greater than on 6 June, because, by the observations, the latitude here was increasing until the fortieth day after opposition, and increased nearly thirteen minutes between the 6th and the 10th of June. Therefore, ignoring parallax and keeping the same refraction, it would be 4\u00b0 1\u00bd\u2019 ^17. VII. On 1593 August 24 at 10h 30m, the ecliptic position of Mars was found  to be 12\u00b0 38\u2019 Pisces,18 with latitude 6\u00b0 5\u2019 30\u201c south. The altitude was great enough that horizontal variations canceled one another. On the August 29th following, at 10h 20m, Mars was observed at 11\u00b0 15\u2019 24\u201c Pisces, with latitude 5\u00b0 52\u2019 15\u201c south. It was decreasing precipitously. For before August 10 it was maximum, fourteen days before opposition. The motion for the five days was 1\u00b0 22\u2019 36\u201c, and for one day, 16\u2019 31\u201c. The sun\u2019s position on August 24 at 10\u00bdh was 11\u00b0 2\u2019 31\u201c Virgo. The stars were 1\u00b0 35\u2019 30\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 58\u2019 20\u201c. The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 14\u2019 51\u201c. This requires 1 day 6 hours 57 min. until opposition, so that this will be August 26 at 5h 27m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 12\u00b0 16\u2019 Pisces. Its latitude was 6\u00b0 2\u2019 south, approximately, if the horizontal variations do indeed cancel.","1649":"On the night following 1589 April 15 at 12h 5m, the planet was found at 3\u00b0 58\u2019 20\u201c Scorpio,13 with latitude 1\u00b0 4\u2019 20\u201c north, decreasing.

Refraction was of course provided for (from the table for the fixed stars), since it was large, in that Mars had no more than 6\u00b0 altitude on the meridian. There was, however, no mention of parallax. But at that time Mars was distant from the earth by half the solar distance. Therefore, the horizontal parallax is greater than 6 minutes, on the supposition that the sun\u2019s parallax is 3\u2019. I omit it nonetheless, partly because the refraction is supplied from the table for the sun (which, as I said, is the more probable), exceeding that which Brahe took here by 4\u00bd\u2019, which almost completely cancels out the parallax; and partly because Mars was on the meridian and near the winter solstice point, and thus had no longitudinal parallax. Of the latitude, on the other hand, it will have to be seen below in Part IV whether it might not be a few minutes less, since the parallax projects the planet too far south.\nThe sun was at 24\u00b0 58\u2019 10\u201c Gemini. The difference in position between the stars was 2\u00b0 16\u2019 10\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 57\u2019 8\u201c, and Mars\u2019s (for four days) was 1\u00b0 12\u2019 24\u201c, since on June 10 at 11h 50m it was at 26\u00b0 2\u2019 18\u201c Sagittarius. For one day, therefore, 18\u2019 12\u201c. The sum of the diurnal motions is 1\u00b0 15\u2019 20\u201c. This corresponds to 1 day 19 hours 24 minutes, which, added to the 6th at 12h 20m (because opposition was yet to come), shows [the moment of opposition to be] the 8th at 7h 43m. Mars\u2019s position was 26\u00b0 41\u2019 48\u201c Sagittarius, to which are added 52\u201c for reduction to the orbit, so as to make it about 26\u00b0 43\u2019 Sagittarius. The latitude was six minutes greater than on 6 June, because, by the observations, the latitude here was increasing until the fortieth day after opposition, and increased nearly thirteen minutes between the 6th and the 10th of June. Therefore, ignoring parallax and keeping the same refraction, it would be 4\u00b0 1\u00bd\u2019 ^17. VII. On 1593 August 24 at 10h 30m, the ecliptic position of Mars was found  to be 12\u00b0 38\u2019 Pisces,18 with latitude 6\u00b0 5\u2019 30\u201c south. The altitude was great enough that horizontal variations canceled one another. On the August 29th following, at 10h 20m, Mars was observed at 11\u00b0 15\u2019 24\u201c Pisces, with latitude 5\u00b0 52\u2019 15\u201c south. It was decreasing precipitously. For before August 10 it was maximum, fourteen days before opposition. The motion for the five days was 1\u00b0 22\u2019 36\u201c, and for one day, 16\u2019 31\u201c. The sun\u2019s position on August 24 at 10\u00bdh was 11\u00b0 2\u2019 31\u201c Virgo. The stars were 1\u00b0 35\u2019 30\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 58\u2019 20\u201c. The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 14\u2019 51\u201c. This requires 1 day 6 hours 57 min. until opposition, so that this will be August 26 at 5h 27m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 12\u00b0 16\u2019 Pisces. Its latitude was 6\u00b0 2\u2019 south, approximately, if the horizontal variations do indeed cancel.","1652":"On the night following 1589 April 15 at 12h 5m, the planet was found at 3\u00b0 58\u2019 20\u201c Scorpio,13 with latitude 1\u00b0 4\u2019 20\u201c north, decreasing. Mars\u2019s altitude was 22\u2155\u00b0, where refraction from the table for the fixed stars was zero, and from the table for the sun, 3\u00bd\u2019. But the parallax was about twice as great as the sun\u2019s, that is, 6 minutes at the horizon. The degree rising was 24\u00b0 Sagittarius. Therefore, the nonagesimal was 64\u00b0 from the zenith, giving a diurnal latitudinal parallax of 5\u2019 24\u201c. Whether it really was that much will become apparent below, through a careful consideration of latitudes ^14. For there, the northern latitude, free from diurnal parallax (and if there is no refraction), would come out to be 1\u00b0 9\u2019 45\u201c north. And because the altitude of the nonagesimal is 26\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax15 at the horizon is 2\u2019 38\u201c. But Mars is 40\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, counting from 4\u00b0 Scorpio to 24\u00b0 Virgo, which, under the column  headed 2\u2019 38\u201c shows a true longitudinal parallax of 1\u2019 42\u201c. That hastens Mars further forward than when viewed from the center of the earth, and this is so on the assumption that it underwent no refraction. But to me it is more probable that it undergoes the same refraction as the sun, greater, that is, than that of the fixed stars, because the opposition of the sun and Mars stirs up the air, while the fixed stars are observed when the air is as calm as possible. Still, let there be no refraction at all, and let Mars be placed at 3\u00b0 57\u2019 Scorpio. At that moment the sun was at 5\u00b0 36\u2019 20\u201c Taurus. At this time, therefore, Mars was 1\u00b0 39\u2019 20\u201c past opposition to the sun. Mars\u2019s diurnal motion, as is clear from comparison with April 13, is 22\u2019 8\u201c; the sun\u2019s, 58\u2019 10\u201c; the sum, 1\u00b0 20\u2019 18\u201c. As this is to 24 hours, so is 1\u00b0 39\u2019 20\u201c to 1 day 5 hours 42 minutes. Therefore, the moment of opposition was April 14 at 6h 23m PM. Its position was 4\u00b0 24\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio, or a little past, if refraction were applied or if the previously assumed value for the diurnal parallax was too great. For reduction to the orbit, some imperceptible quantity must be subtracted, since it is barely 12 degrees from the node. This would be about 24 seconds, which are of no importance, and Mars would be at 4\u00b0 24\u2019 Scorpio, with latitude three minutes greater than before. For from that position, the latitude was decreasing from the eighth of March; nor was it a maximum at opposition.\nVI.

The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 57\u2019 8\u201c, and Mars\u2019s (for four days) was 1\u00b0 12\u2019 24\u201c, since on June 10 at 11h 50m it was at 26\u00b0 2\u2019 18\u201c Sagittarius.

The sun\u2019s position on August 24 at 10\u00bdh was 11\u00b0 2\u2019 31\u201c Virgo. The stars were 1\u00b0 35\u2019 30\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 58\u2019 20\u201c. The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 14\u2019 51\u201c. This requires 1 day 6 hours 57 min. until opposition, so that this will be August 26 at 5h 27m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 12\u00b0 16\u2019 Pisces. Its latitude was 6\u00b0 2\u2019 south, approximately, if the horizontal variations do indeed cancel.","1655":"On the night following 1589 April 15 at 12h 5m, the planet was found at 3\u00b0 58\u2019 20\u201c Scorpio,13 with latitude 1\u00b0 4\u2019 20\u201c north, decreasing. Mars\u2019s altitude was 22\u2155\u00b0, where refraction from the table for the fixed stars was zero, and from the table for the sun, 3\u00bd\u2019. But the parallax was about twice as great as the sun\u2019s, that is, 6 minutes at the horizon. The degree rising was 24\u00b0 Sagittarius. Therefore, the nonagesimal was 64\u00b0 from the zenith, giving a diurnal latitudinal parallax of 5\u2019 24\u201c. Whether it really was that much will become apparent below, through a careful consideration of latitudes ^14. For there, the northern latitude, free from diurnal parallax (and if there is no refraction), would come out to be 1\u00b0 9\u2019 45\u201c north. And because the altitude of the nonagesimal is 26\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax15 at the horizon is 2\u2019 38\u201c. But Mars is 40\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, counting from 4\u00b0 Scorpio to 24\u00b0 Virgo, which, under the column  headed 2\u2019 38\u201c shows a true longitudinal parallax of 1\u2019 42\u201c. That hastens Mars further forward than when viewed from the center of the earth, and this is so on the assumption that it underwent no refraction. But to me it is more probable that it undergoes the same refraction as the sun, greater, that is, than that of the fixed stars, because the opposition of the sun and Mars stirs up the air, while the fixed stars are observed when the air is as calm as possible. Still, let there be no refraction at all, and let Mars be placed at 3\u00b0 57\u2019 Scorpio. At that moment the sun was at 5\u00b0 36\u2019 20\u201c Taurus. At this time, therefore, Mars was 1\u00b0 39\u2019 20\u201c past opposition to the sun. Mars\u2019s diurnal motion, as is clear from comparison with April 13, is 22\u2019 8\u201c; the sun\u2019s, 58\u2019 10\u201c; the sum, 1\u00b0 20\u2019 18\u201c. As this is to 24 hours, so is 1\u00b0 39\u2019 20\u201c to 1 day 5 hours 42 minutes. Therefore, the moment of opposition was April 14 at 6h 23m PM. Its position was 4\u00b0 24\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio, or a little past, if refraction were applied or if the previously assumed value for the diurnal parallax was too great. For reduction to the orbit, some imperceptible quantity must be subtracted, since it is barely 12 degrees from the node. This would be about 24 seconds, which are of no importance, and Mars would be at 4\u00b0 24\u2019 Scorpio, with latitude three minutes greater than before. For from that position, the latitude was decreasing from the eighth of March; nor was it a maximum at opposition.\nVI. On the night following 1591 June 6 at 12h 20m, Mars was found at 27\u00b0 14\u2019 42\u201c Sagittarius,16 with latitude 3\u00b0 55\u00bd\u2019 south. Refraction was of course provided for (from the table for the fixed stars), since it was large, in that Mars had no more than 6\u00b0 altitude on the meridian. There was, however, no mention of parallax. But at that time Mars was distant from the earth by half the solar distance. Therefore, the horizontal parallax is greater than 6 minutes, on the supposition that the sun\u2019s parallax is 3\u2019. I omit it nonetheless, partly because the refraction is supplied from the table for the sun (which, as I said, is the more probable), exceeding that which Brahe took here by 4\u00bd\u2019, which almost completely cancels out the parallax; and partly because Mars was on the meridian and near the winter solstice point, and thus had no longitudinal parallax. Of the latitude, on the other hand, it will have to be seen below in Part IV whether it might not be a few minutes less, since the parallax projects the planet too far south.\nThe sun was at 24\u00b0 58\u2019 10\u201c Gemini. The difference in position between the stars was 2\u00b0 16\u2019 10\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 57\u2019 8\u201c, and Mars\u2019s (for four days) was 1\u00b0 12\u2019 24\u201c, since on June 10 at 11h 50m it was at 26\u00b0 2\u2019 18\u201c Sagittarius. For one day, therefore, 18\u2019 12\u201c. The sum of the diurnal motions is 1\u00b0 15\u2019 20\u201c. This corresponds to 1 day 19 hours 24 minutes, which, added to the 6th at 12h 20m (because opposition was yet to come), shows [the moment of opposition to be] the 8th at 7h 43m. Mars\u2019s position was 26\u00b0 41\u2019 48\u201c Sagittarius, to which are added 52\u201c for reduction to the orbit, so as to make it about 26\u00b0 43\u2019 Sagittarius. The latitude was six minutes greater than on 6 June, because, by the observations, the latitude here was increasing until the fortieth day after opposition, and increased nearly thirteen minutes between the 6th and the 10th of June. Therefore, ignoring parallax and keeping the same refraction, it would be 4\u00b0 1\u00bd\u2019 ^17. VII. On 1593 August 24 at 10h 30m, the ecliptic position of Mars was found  to be 12\u00b0 38\u2019 Pisces,18 with latitude 6\u00b0 5\u2019 30\u201c south. The altitude was great enough that horizontal variations canceled one another. On the August 29th following, at 10h 20m, Mars was observed at 11\u00b0 15\u2019 24\u201c Pisces, with latitude 5\u00b0 52\u2019 15\u201c south. It was decreasing precipitously.

As this is to 24 hours, so is 1\u00b0 39\u2019 20\u201c to 1 day 5 hours 42 minutes. Therefore, the moment of opposition was April 14 at 6h 23m PM.

Mars\u2019s diurnal motion, as is clear from comparison with April 13, is 22\u2019 8\u201c; the sun\u2019s, 58\u2019 10\u201c; the sum, 1\u00b0 20\u2019 18\u201c. As this is to 24 hours, so is 1\u00b0 39\u2019 20\u201c to 1 day 5 hours 42 minutes. Therefore, the moment of opposition was April 14 at 6h 23m PM. Its position was 4\u00b0 24\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio, or a little past, if refraction were applied or if the previously assumed value for the diurnal parallax was too great. For reduction to the orbit, some imperceptible quantity must be subtracted, since it is barely 12 degrees from the node. This would be about 24 seconds, which are of no importance, and Mars would be at 4\u00b0 24\u2019 Scorpio, with latitude three minutes greater than before. For from that position, the latitude was decreasing from the eighth of March; nor was it a maximum at opposition.\nVI. On the night following 1591 June 6 at 12h 20m, Mars was found at 27\u00b0 14\u2019 42\u201c Sagittarius,16 with latitude 3\u00b0 55\u00bd\u2019 south. Refraction was of course provided for (from the table for the fixed stars), since it was large, in that Mars had no more than 6\u00b0 altitude on the meridian. There was, however, no mention of parallax. But at that time Mars was distant from the earth by half the solar distance. Therefore, the horizontal parallax is greater than 6 minutes, on the supposition that the sun\u2019s parallax is 3\u2019. I omit it nonetheless, partly because the refraction is supplied from the table for the sun (which, as I said, is the more probable), exceeding that which Brahe took here by 4\u00bd\u2019, which almost completely cancels out the parallax; and partly because Mars was on the meridian and near the winter solstice point, and thus had no longitudinal parallax. Of the latitude, on the other hand, it will have to be seen below in Part IV whether it might not be a few minutes less, since the parallax projects the planet too far south.\nThe sun was at 24\u00b0 58\u2019 10\u201c Gemini. The difference in position between the stars was 2\u00b0 16\u2019 10\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 57\u2019 8\u201c, and Mars\u2019s (for four days) was 1\u00b0 12\u2019 24\u201c, since on June 10 at 11h 50m it was at 26\u00b0 2\u2019 18\u201c Sagittarius. For one day, therefore, 18\u2019 12\u201c. The sum of the diurnal motions is 1\u00b0 15\u2019 20\u201c. This corresponds to 1 day 19 hours 24 minutes, which, added to the 6th at 12h 20m (because opposition was yet to come), shows [the moment of opposition to be] the 8th at 7h 43m. Mars\u2019s position was 26\u00b0 41\u2019 48\u201c Sagittarius, to which are added 52\u201c for reduction to the orbit, so as to make it about 26\u00b0 43\u2019 Sagittarius. The latitude was six minutes greater than on 6 June, because, by the observations, the latitude here was increasing until the fortieth day after opposition, and increased nearly thirteen minutes between the 6th and the 10th of June. Therefore, ignoring parallax and keeping the same refraction, it would be 4\u00b0 1\u00bd\u2019 ^17. VII. On 1593 August 24 at 10h 30m, the ecliptic position of Mars was found  to be 12\u00b0 38\u2019 Pisces,18 with latitude 6\u00b0 5\u2019 30\u201c south. The altitude was great enough that horizontal variations canceled one another. On the August 29th following, at 10h 20m, Mars was observed at 11\u00b0 15\u2019 24\u201c Pisces, with latitude 5\u00b0 52\u2019 15\u201c south. It was decreasing precipitously. For before August 10 it was maximum, fourteen days before opposition. The motion for the five days was 1\u00b0 22\u2019 36\u201c, and for one day, 16\u2019 31\u201c. The sun\u2019s position on August 24 at 10\u00bdh was 11\u00b0 2\u2019 31\u201c Virgo. The stars were 1\u00b0 35\u2019 30\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 58\u2019 20\u201c. The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 14\u2019 51\u201c. This requires 1 day 6 hours 57 min. until opposition, so that this will be August 26 at 5h 27m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 12\u00b0 16\u2019 Pisces. Its latitude was 6\u00b0 2\u2019 south, approximately, if the horizontal variations do indeed cancel.","1659":"On the night following 1589 April 15 at 12h 5m, the planet was found at 3\u00b0 58\u2019 20\u201c Scorpio,13 with latitude 1\u00b0 4\u2019 20\u201c north, decreasing. Mars\u2019s altitude was 22\u2155\u00b0, where refraction from the table for the fixed stars was zero, and from the table for the sun, 3\u00bd\u2019. But the parallax was about twice as great as the sun\u2019s, that is, 6 minutes at the horizon. The degree rising was 24\u00b0 Sagittarius. Therefore, the nonagesimal was 64\u00b0 from the zenith, giving a diurnal latitudinal parallax of 5\u2019 24\u201c. Whether it really was that much will become apparent below, through a careful consideration of latitudes ^14. For there, the northern latitude, free from diurnal parallax (and if there is no refraction), would come out to be 1\u00b0 9\u2019 45\u201c north. And because the altitude of the nonagesimal is 26\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax15 at the horizon is 2\u2019 38\u201c. But Mars is 40\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, counting from 4\u00b0 Scorpio to 24\u00b0 Virgo, which, under the column  headed 2\u2019 38\u201c shows a true longitudinal parallax of 1\u2019 42\u201c. That hastens Mars further forward than when viewed from the center of the earth, and this is so on the assumption that it underwent no refraction. But to me it is more probable that it undergoes the same refraction as the sun, greater, that is, than that of the fixed stars, because the opposition of the sun and Mars stirs up the air, while the fixed stars are observed when the air is as calm as possible. Still, let there be no refraction at all, and let Mars be placed at 3\u00b0 57\u2019 Scorpio. At that moment the sun was at 5\u00b0 36\u2019 20\u201c Taurus.

As this is to 24 hours, so is 1\u00b0 39\u2019 20\u201c to 1 day 5 hours 42 minutes. Therefore, the moment of opposition was April 14 at 6h 23m PM. Its position was 4\u00b0 24\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio, or a little past, if refraction were applied or if the previously assumed value for the diurnal parallax was too great.

For one day, therefore, 18\u2019 12\u201c. The sum of the diurnal motions is 1\u00b0 15\u2019 20\u201c.

The latitude was six minutes greater than on 6 June, because, by the observations, the latitude here was increasing until the fortieth day after opposition, and increased nearly thirteen minutes between the 6th and the 10th of June. Therefore, ignoring parallax and keeping the same refraction, it would be 4\u00b0 1\u00bd\u2019 ^17. VII. On 1593 August 24 at 10h 30m, the ecliptic position of Mars was found  to be 12\u00b0 38\u2019 Pisces,18 with latitude 6\u00b0 5\u2019 30\u201c south. The altitude was great enough that horizontal variations canceled one another. On the August 29th following, at 10h 20m, Mars was observed at 11\u00b0 15\u2019 24\u201c Pisces, with latitude 5\u00b0 52\u2019 15\u201c south. It was decreasing precipitously. For before August 10 it was maximum, fourteen days before opposition. The motion for the five days was 1\u00b0 22\u2019 36\u201c, and for one day, 16\u2019 31\u201c. The sun\u2019s position on August 24 at 10\u00bdh was 11\u00b0 2\u2019 31\u201c Virgo. The stars were 1\u00b0 35\u2019 30\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 58\u2019 20\u201c. The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 14\u2019 51\u201c. This requires 1 day 6 hours 57 min. until opposition, so that this will be August 26 at 5h 27m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 12\u00b0 16\u2019 Pisces. Its latitude was 6\u00b0 2\u2019 south, approximately, if the horizontal variations do indeed cancel.","1662":"On the night following 1589 April 15 at 12h 5m, the planet was found at 3\u00b0 58\u2019 20\u201c Scorpio,13 with latitude 1\u00b0 4\u2019 20\u201c north, decreasing. Mars\u2019s altitude was 22\u2155\u00b0, where refraction from the table for the fixed stars was zero, and from the table for the sun, 3\u00bd\u2019. But the parallax was about twice as great as the sun\u2019s, that is, 6 minutes at the horizon. The degree rising was 24\u00b0 Sagittarius. Therefore, the nonagesimal was 64\u00b0 from the zenith, giving a diurnal latitudinal parallax of 5\u2019 24\u201c. Whether it really was that much will become apparent below, through a careful consideration of latitudes ^14. For there, the northern latitude, free from diurnal parallax (and if there is no refraction), would come out to be 1\u00b0 9\u2019 45\u201c north. And because the altitude of the nonagesimal is 26\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax15 at the horizon is 2\u2019 38\u201c. But Mars is 40\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, counting from 4\u00b0 Scorpio to 24\u00b0 Virgo, which, under the column  headed 2\u2019 38\u201c shows a true longitudinal parallax of 1\u2019 42\u201c. That hastens Mars further forward than when viewed from the center of the earth, and this is so on the assumption that it underwent no refraction. But to me it is more probable that it undergoes the same refraction as the sun, greater, that is, than that of the fixed stars, because the opposition of the sun and Mars stirs up the air, while the fixed stars are observed when the air is as calm as possible. Still, let there be no refraction at all, and let Mars be placed at 3\u00b0 57\u2019 Scorpio. At that moment the sun was at 5\u00b0 36\u2019 20\u201c Taurus. At this time, therefore, Mars was 1\u00b0 39\u2019 20\u201c past opposition to the sun. Mars\u2019s diurnal motion, as is clear from comparison with April 13, is 22\u2019 8\u201c; the sun\u2019s, 58\u2019 10\u201c; the sum, 1\u00b0 20\u2019 18\u201c. As this is to 24 hours, so is 1\u00b0 39\u2019 20\u201c to 1 day 5 hours 42 minutes. Therefore, the moment of opposition was April 14 at 6h 23m PM. Its position was 4\u00b0 24\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio, or a little past, if refraction were applied or if the previously assumed value for the diurnal parallax was too great. For reduction to the orbit, some imperceptible quantity must be subtracted, since it is barely 12 degrees from the node. This would be about 24 seconds, which are of no importance, and Mars would be at 4\u00b0 24\u2019 Scorpio, with latitude three minutes greater than before. For from that position, the latitude was decreasing from the eighth of March; nor was it a maximum at opposition.\nVI. On the night following 1591 June 6 at 12h 20m, Mars was found at 27\u00b0 14\u2019 42\u201c Sagittarius,16 with latitude 3\u00b0 55\u00bd\u2019 south. Refraction was of course provided for (from the table for the fixed stars), since it was large, in that Mars had no more than 6\u00b0 altitude on the meridian. There was, however, no mention of parallax. But at that time Mars was distant from the earth by half the solar distance. Therefore, the horizontal parallax is greater than 6 minutes, on the supposition that the sun\u2019s parallax is 3\u2019. I omit it nonetheless, partly because the refraction is supplied from the table for the sun (which, as I said, is the more probable), exceeding that which Brahe took here by 4\u00bd\u2019, which almost completely cancels out the parallax; and partly because Mars was on the meridian and near the winter solstice point, and thus had no longitudinal parallax. Of the latitude, on the other hand, it will have to be seen below in Part IV whether it might not be a few minutes less, since the parallax projects the planet too far south.\nThe sun was at 24\u00b0 58\u2019 10\u201c Gemini. The difference in position between the stars was 2\u00b0 16\u2019 10\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 57\u2019 8\u201c, and Mars\u2019s (for four days) was 1\u00b0 12\u2019 24\u201c, since on June 10 at 11h 50m it was at 26\u00b0 2\u2019 18\u201c Sagittarius. For one day, therefore, 18\u2019 12\u201c. The sum of the diurnal motions is 1\u00b0 15\u2019 20\u201c. This corresponds to 1 day 19 hours 24 minutes, which, added to the 6th at 12h 20m (because opposition was yet to come), shows [the moment of opposition to be] the 8th at 7h 43m. Mars\u2019s position was 26\u00b0 41\u2019 48\u201c Sagittarius, to which are added 52\u201c for reduction to the orbit, so as to make it about 26\u00b0 43\u2019 Sagittarius.

But Mars is 40\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, counting from 4\u00b0 Scorpio to 24\u00b0 Virgo, which, under the column  headed 2\u2019 38\u201c shows a true longitudinal parallax of 1\u2019 42\u201c. That hastens Mars further forward than when viewed from the center of the earth, and this is so on the assumption that it underwent no refraction. But to me it is more probable that it undergoes the same refraction as the sun, greater, that is, than that of the fixed stars, because the opposition of the sun and Mars stirs up the air, while the fixed stars are observed when the air is as calm as possible. Still, let there be no refraction at all, and let Mars be placed at 3\u00b0 57\u2019 Scorpio. At that moment the sun was at 5\u00b0 36\u2019 20\u201c Taurus. At this time, therefore, Mars was 1\u00b0 39\u2019 20\u201c past opposition to the sun. Mars\u2019s diurnal motion, as is clear from comparison with April 13, is 22\u2019 8\u201c; the sun\u2019s, 58\u2019 10\u201c; the sum, 1\u00b0 20\u2019 18\u201c. As this is to 24 hours, so is 1\u00b0 39\u2019 20\u201c to 1 day 5 hours 42 minutes. Therefore, the moment of opposition was April 14 at 6h 23m PM. Its position was 4\u00b0 24\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio, or a little past, if refraction were applied or if the previously assumed value for the diurnal parallax was too great. For reduction to the orbit, some imperceptible quantity must be subtracted, since it is barely 12 degrees from the node. This would be about 24 seconds, which are of no importance, and Mars would be at 4\u00b0 24\u2019 Scorpio, with latitude three minutes greater than before. For from that position, the latitude was decreasing from the eighth of March; nor was it a maximum at opposition.\nVI. On the night following 1591 June 6 at 12h 20m, Mars was found at 27\u00b0 14\u2019 42\u201c Sagittarius,16 with latitude 3\u00b0 55\u00bd\u2019 south. Refraction was of course provided for (from the table for the fixed stars), since it was large, in that Mars had no more than 6\u00b0 altitude on the meridian. There was, however, no mention of parallax. But at that time Mars was distant from the earth by half the solar distance. Therefore, the horizontal parallax is greater than 6 minutes, on the supposition that the sun\u2019s parallax is 3\u2019. I omit it nonetheless, partly because the refraction is supplied from the table for the sun (which, as I said, is the more probable), exceeding that which Brahe took here by 4\u00bd\u2019, which almost completely cancels out the parallax; and partly because Mars was on the meridian and near the winter solstice point, and thus had no longitudinal parallax. Of the latitude, on the other hand, it will have to be seen below in Part IV whether it might not be a few minutes less, since the parallax projects the planet too far south.\nThe sun was at 24\u00b0 58\u2019 10\u201c Gemini. The difference in position between the stars was 2\u00b0 16\u2019 10\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 57\u2019 8\u201c, and Mars\u2019s (for four days) was 1\u00b0 12\u2019 24\u201c, since on June 10 at 11h 50m it was at 26\u00b0 2\u2019 18\u201c Sagittarius. For one day, therefore, 18\u2019 12\u201c. The sum of the diurnal motions is 1\u00b0 15\u2019 20\u201c. This corresponds to 1 day 19 hours 24 minutes, which, added to the 6th at 12h 20m (because opposition was yet to come), shows [the moment of opposition to be] the 8th at 7h 43m. Mars\u2019s position was 26\u00b0 41\u2019 48\u201c Sagittarius, to which are added 52\u201c for reduction to the orbit, so as to make it about 26\u00b0 43\u2019 Sagittarius. The latitude was six minutes greater than on 6 June, because, by the observations, the latitude here was increasing until the fortieth day after opposition, and increased nearly thirteen minutes between the 6th and the 10th of June. Therefore, ignoring parallax and keeping the same refraction, it would be 4\u00b0 1\u00bd\u2019 ^17. VII. On 1593 August 24 at 10h 30m, the ecliptic position of Mars was found  to be 12\u00b0 38\u2019 Pisces,18 with latitude 6\u00b0 5\u2019 30\u201c south. The altitude was great enough that horizontal variations canceled one another. On the August 29th following, at 10h 20m, Mars was observed at 11\u00b0 15\u2019 24\u201c Pisces, with latitude 5\u00b0 52\u2019 15\u201c south. It was decreasing precipitously. For before August 10 it was maximum, fourteen days before opposition. The motion for the five days was 1\u00b0 22\u2019 36\u201c, and for one day, 16\u2019 31\u201c. The sun\u2019s position on August 24 at 10\u00bdh was 11\u00b0 2\u2019 31\u201c Virgo. The stars were 1\u00b0 35\u2019 30\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 58\u2019 20\u201c. The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 14\u2019 51\u201c. This requires 1 day 6 hours 57 min. until opposition, so that this will be August 26 at 5h 27m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 12\u00b0 16\u2019 Pisces. Its latitude was 6\u00b0 2\u2019 south, approximately, if the horizontal variations do indeed cancel.","1666":"On the night following 1589 April 15 at 12h 5m, the planet was found at 3\u00b0 58\u2019 20\u201c Scorpio,13 with latitude 1\u00b0 4\u2019 20\u201c north, decreasing. Mars\u2019s altitude was 22\u2155\u00b0, where refraction from the table for the fixed stars was zero, and from the table for the sun, 3\u00bd\u2019. But the parallax was about twice as great as the sun\u2019s, that is, 6 minutes at the horizon. The degree rising was 24\u00b0 Sagittarius. Therefore, the nonagesimal was 64\u00b0 from the zenith, giving a diurnal latitudinal parallax of 5\u2019 24\u201c. Whether it really was that much will become apparent below, through a careful consideration of latitudes ^14. For there, the northern latitude, free from diurnal parallax (and if there is no refraction), would come out to be 1\u00b0 9\u2019 45\u201c north.

As this is to 24 hours, so is 1\u00b0 39\u2019 20\u201c to 1 day 5 hours 42 minutes. Therefore, the moment of opposition was April 14 at 6h 23m PM.

The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 57\u2019 8\u201c, and Mars\u2019s (for four days) was 1\u00b0 12\u2019 24\u201c, since on June 10 at 11h 50m it was at 26\u00b0 2\u2019 18\u201c Sagittarius. For one day, therefore, 18\u2019 12\u201c. The sum of the diurnal motions is 1\u00b0 15\u2019 20\u201c. This corresponds to 1 day 19 hours 24 minutes, which, added to the 6th at 12h 20m (because opposition was yet to come), shows [the moment of opposition to be] the 8th at 7h 43m. Mars\u2019s position was 26\u00b0 41\u2019 48\u201c Sagittarius, to which are added 52\u201c for reduction to the orbit, so as to make it about 26\u00b0 43\u2019 Sagittarius. The latitude was six minutes greater than on 6 June, because, by the observations, the latitude here was increasing until the fortieth day after opposition, and increased nearly thirteen minutes between the 6th and the 10th of June. Therefore, ignoring parallax and keeping the same refraction, it would be 4\u00b0 1\u00bd\u2019 ^17. VII. On 1593 August 24 at 10h 30m, the ecliptic position of Mars was found  to be 12\u00b0 38\u2019 Pisces,18 with latitude 6\u00b0 5\u2019 30\u201c south. The altitude was great enough that horizontal variations canceled one another. On the August 29th following, at 10h 20m, Mars was observed at 11\u00b0 15\u2019 24\u201c Pisces, with latitude 5\u00b0 52\u2019 15\u201c south. It was decreasing precipitously. For before August 10 it was maximum, fourteen days before opposition. The motion for the five days was 1\u00b0 22\u2019 36\u201c, and for one day, 16\u2019 31\u201c. The sun\u2019s position on August 24 at 10\u00bdh was 11\u00b0 2\u2019 31\u201c Virgo. The stars were 1\u00b0 35\u2019 30\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 58\u2019 20\u201c. The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 14\u2019 51\u201c. This requires 1 day 6 hours 57 min. until opposition, so that this will be August 26 at 5h 27m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 12\u00b0 16\u2019 Pisces. Its latitude was 6\u00b0 2\u2019 south, approximately, if the horizontal variations do indeed cancel.","1669":"On the night following 1589 April 15 at 12h 5m, the planet was found at 3\u00b0 58\u2019 20\u201c Scorpio,13 with latitude 1\u00b0 4\u2019 20\u201c north, decreasing. Mars\u2019s altitude was 22\u2155\u00b0, where refraction from the table for the fixed stars was zero, and from the table for the sun, 3\u00bd\u2019. But the parallax was about twice as great as the sun\u2019s, that is, 6 minutes at the horizon. The degree rising was 24\u00b0 Sagittarius. Therefore, the nonagesimal was 64\u00b0 from the zenith, giving a diurnal latitudinal parallax of 5\u2019 24\u201c. Whether it really was that much will become apparent below, through a careful consideration of latitudes ^14. For there, the northern latitude, free from diurnal parallax (and if there is no refraction), would come out to be 1\u00b0 9\u2019 45\u201c north. And because the altitude of the nonagesimal is 26\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax15 at the horizon is 2\u2019 38\u201c. But Mars is 40\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, counting from 4\u00b0 Scorpio to 24\u00b0 Virgo, which, under the column  headed 2\u2019 38\u201c shows a true longitudinal parallax of 1\u2019 42\u201c. That hastens Mars further forward than when viewed from the center of the earth, and this is so on the assumption that it underwent no refraction. But to me it is more probable that it undergoes the same refraction as the sun, greater, that is, than that of the fixed stars, because the opposition of the sun and Mars stirs up the air, while the fixed stars are observed when the air is as calm as possible. Still, let there be no refraction at all, and let Mars be placed at 3\u00b0 57\u2019 Scorpio. At that moment the sun was at 5\u00b0 36\u2019 20\u201c Taurus. At this time, therefore, Mars was 1\u00b0 39\u2019 20\u201c past opposition to the sun. Mars\u2019s diurnal motion, as is clear from comparison with April 13, is 22\u2019 8\u201c; the sun\u2019s, 58\u2019 10\u201c; the sum, 1\u00b0 20\u2019 18\u201c. As this is to 24 hours, so is 1\u00b0 39\u2019 20\u201c to 1 day 5 hours 42 minutes. Therefore, the moment of opposition was April 14 at 6h 23m PM. Its position was 4\u00b0 24\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio, or a little past, if refraction were applied or if the previously assumed value for the diurnal parallax was too great. For reduction to the orbit, some imperceptible quantity must be subtracted, since it is barely 12 degrees from the node. This would be about 24 seconds, which are of no importance, and Mars would be at 4\u00b0 24\u2019 Scorpio, with latitude three minutes greater than before. For from that position, the latitude was decreasing from the eighth of March; nor was it a maximum at opposition.\nVI. On the night following 1591 June 6 at 12h 20m, Mars was found at 27\u00b0 14\u2019 42\u201c Sagittarius,16 with latitude 3\u00b0 55\u00bd\u2019 south. Refraction was of course provided for (from the table for the fixed stars), since it was large, in that Mars had no more than 6\u00b0 altitude on the meridian. There was, however, no mention of parallax. But at that time Mars was distant from the earth by half the solar distance. Therefore, the horizontal parallax is greater than 6 minutes, on the supposition that the sun\u2019s parallax is 3\u2019. I omit it nonetheless, partly because the refraction is supplied from the table for the sun (which, as I said, is the more probable), exceeding that which Brahe took here by 4\u00bd\u2019, which almost completely cancels out the parallax; and partly because Mars was on the meridian and near the winter solstice point, and thus had no longitudinal parallax. Of the latitude, on the other hand, it will have to be seen below in Part IV whether it might not be a few minutes less, since the parallax projects the planet too far south.\nThe sun was at 24\u00b0 58\u2019 10\u201c Gemini. The difference in position between the stars was 2\u00b0 16\u2019 10\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 57\u2019 8\u201c, and Mars\u2019s (for four days) was 1\u00b0 12\u2019 24\u201c, since on June 10 at 11h 50m it was at 26\u00b0 2\u2019 18\u201c Sagittarius. For one day, therefore, 18\u2019 12\u201c. The sum of the diurnal motions is 1\u00b0 15\u2019 20\u201c. This corresponds to 1 day 19 hours 24 minutes, which, added to the 6th at 12h 20m (because opposition was yet to come), shows [the moment of opposition to be] the 8th at 7h 43m. Mars\u2019s position was 26\u00b0 41\u2019 48\u201c Sagittarius, to which are added 52\u201c for reduction to the orbit, so as to make it about 26\u00b0 43\u2019 Sagittarius. The latitude was six minutes greater than on 6 June, because, by the observations, the latitude here was increasing until the fortieth day after opposition, and increased nearly thirteen minutes between the 6th and the 10th of June. Therefore, ignoring parallax and keeping the same refraction, it would be 4\u00b0 1\u00bd\u2019 ^17. VII. On 1593 August 24 at 10h 30m, the ecliptic position of Mars was found  to be 12\u00b0 38\u2019 Pisces,18 with latitude 6\u00b0 5\u2019 30\u201c south. The altitude was great enough that horizontal variations canceled one another. On the August 29th following, at 10h 20m, Mars was observed at 11\u00b0 15\u2019 24\u201c Pisces, with latitude 5\u00b0 52\u2019 15\u201c south. It was decreasing precipitously. For before August 10 it was maximum, fourteen days before opposition. The motion for the five days was 1\u00b0 22\u2019 36\u201c, and for one day, 16\u2019 31\u201c. The sun\u2019s position on August 24 at 10\u00bdh was 11\u00b0 2\u2019 31\u201c Virgo. The stars were 1\u00b0 35\u2019 30\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 58\u2019 20\u201c. The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 14\u2019 51\u201c. This requires 1 day 6 hours 57 min. until opposition, so that this will be August 26 at 5h 27m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 12\u00b0 16\u2019 Pisces. Its latitude was 6\u00b0 2\u2019 south, approximately, if the horizontal variations do indeed cancel.","1670":"VIII. On 1595 October 30 at 8h 20m, the planet was found at 17\u00b0 47\u2019 15\u201c Taurus,19 not far from the nonagesimal. We may thus be sure of the parallax, although we must take it into account. The latitude was 0\u00b0 5\u2019 10\u201c north. The sun\u2019s position was 16\u00b0 50\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio. The distance between the stars was 56\u2019 45\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 35\u201c; that of Mars, 22\u2019 54\u201c, as appears by comparing the nearby observations. The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 23\u2019 29\u201c. If the distance between the stars be divided by this, it comes out to 40\u2019 47\u201c of a day, or 16 hours 19 min. Therefore, the true opposition was 0h 39m PM on October 31. Mars\u2019s position was 17\u00b0 31\u2019 40\u201c Taurus. This needs no reduction to the orbit, as it is nearly at the node. The latitude was about 0\u00b0 8\u2019 north. But comparison with the preceding and following days shows a latitude of about 5\u2019 north.\nIX. Let, at any rate, Mars\u2019s position on 1597 December 10 at 8h 30m be 3\u00b0 45\u00bd\u2019 Cancer (as above) ^20. The sun\u2019s position was 29\u00b0 4\u2019 53\u201c Sagittarius. The distance between the stars was 4\u00b0 40\u2019 37\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 61\u2019 20\u201c, that of Mars 23\u2019 40\u201c (for in 1580 the diurnal motion in Gemini was 23\u2019, and in 1582, at 17\u00b0 Cancer, it was 24\u2019). Therefore, the sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 25\u2019 0\u201c. These data show that the time of true opposition followed 3 days 7 hours 14 min. later, on December 14 at 3h 44m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 2\u00b0 27\u2153\u2019 Cancer. The reduction to the orbit (quite ridiculous here, since the observation itself has an uncertainty of several minutes) requires the addition of about 52\u201c. Therefore, the corrected position was 2\u00b0 28\u2019 Cancer. The latitude, from the table, was 3\u00b0 33\u2019 north.\nOn the same night, the one following December 10, at 12\u2159h, Fabricius in East Frisia found Mars\u2019s position to be 3\u00b0 40\u00bc\u2019 Cancer with latitude 3\u00b0 23\u2019 N. In this observation the longitude comes out nearly the same. For the motion over 3h 40m is 3\u00bd\u2019, so that in the Brahean observation too, at 12\u2159h Mars could have been at 3\u00b0 42\u2019 Cancer\u2014two minutes beyond the Fabrician position.\nX. On 1600 January 13\/23 at 11h 40m, the time being adjusted to Uraniborg time, the planet was observed at 10\u00b0 38\u2019 46\u201c Leo ^21. The sun\u2019s position was 3\u00b0 26\u2019 30\u201c Aquarius. The stars were 7\u00b0 12\u2019 16\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion for the next few days was 1\u00b0 1\u2019 3\u201c; that of Mars, 23\u2019 44\u201c. The sum: 1\u00b0 24\u2019 47\u201c. The opposition therefore followed 5 days 2h 22m after; that is, on January 19\/29 at 2h 2m in the morning, before dawn. Mars was at 8\u00b0 38\u2019 Leo. There is no need for reduction, since it is near the limit. The latitude, from the table, was 4\u00b0 30\u2019 50\u201c N.\nXI. On the evening of 1602 Febr. 18\/28 at 10h 30m, using the Tychonic  instruments (with the help of the learned Matthias Seiffard,22 bequeathed us by Tycho), I took the distance of Mars from the middle star of the tail of Ursa Major 23 to be 52\u00b0 22\u2019. And since the distance between Cor Leonis and Procyon was 37\u00b0 22\u2019 20\u201c, which should have been 37\u00b0 19\u2019 50\u201c,24 we know that the sextant reads 2\u00bd minutes high. Therefore, the corrected distance of Mars from the tail of Ursa was 52\u00b0 19\u00bd\u2019. And since the latitude of the fixed star is 56\u00b0 22\u2019, the remainder, by subtraction, is 4\u00b0 2\u00bd\u2019\u2014supposing that Mars was at precisely the same longitude as the fixed star. But because there was a difference of 3\u00be degrees between them (as is clear from the following observations), a slight correction is required.\n For let AB be 3\u00b0 43\u2019 30\u201c on a parallel close to the ecliptic, B Mars, C the fixed star, and BC 52\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c. Dividing the secant of BC by the secant of AB gives the  secant of CA, 52\u00b0 14\u2019, which, subtracted from 56\u00b0 22\u2019 (the latitude of the fixed star) leaves 4\u00b0 8\u2019 north as Mars\u2019s observed latitude. At the same time, we found 19\u00b0 23\u2019 between Mars and Cor Leonis (19\u00b0 20\u00bd corrected), and 21\u00b0 20\u2019 between Mars and the bright star in the wing of Virgo25 (21\u00b0 17\u00bd\u2019 corrected). From these two distances (using the latitudes of the stars and Mars), Mars\u2019s longitude is found to be 13\u00b0 19\u2019 6\u201c Virgo, by consensus of all measurements.\nAlternatively, the meridian altitude of Mars was found at 12h 40m, using two quadrants, to be 50\u00b0 19\u2019, while the tail of Leo26 was 56\u00b0 45\u2019. Therefore, from the declinations and right ascensions of the fixed stars and our distances, Mars\u2019s position is determined as 13\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c Virgo, latitude 4\u00b0 7\u2019 55\u201c ^27. This is the Tychonic procedure. I have included the other for the sake of showing a consensus, and also that it might be evident that despite the lack of absolute perfection in the demonstration, short cuts either in computation or in our understanding can under certain circumstances be applied. For in that previous procedure there is less in the actual work than in the reporting of it. At Prague, 5\u00b0 Scorpio was rising ^28. Therefore, the nonagesimal was about 32\u00bd\u00b0 from the zenith. And since Mars\u2019s distance from the earth was rather more than half the sun\u2019s distance, the resulting parallax of about 5\u2019 opposite 32\u00bd\u00b0 in our parallactic table, shows a latitudinal parallax of 2\u2019 41\u201c. Thus the latitude as seen from the middle of the earth would be 4\u00b0 10\u2154\u2019 north. And because the altitude of the nonagesimal was 57\u00bd\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax at the horizon was 4\u2019 13\u201c. But since Mars was 38\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, the longitudinal parallax corresponding to this position is 2\u2019 36\u201c, and if this be eliminated, Mars would be placed at about 13\u00b0 18\u2019 Virgo ^29. At that moment, the sun\u2019s position was 10\u00b0 16\u2019 42\u201c Pisces. The distance between the bodies was 3\u00b0 1\u2019 18\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 4\u201c, and that of Mars, 24\u2019 5\u201c (for it was 24\u2019 18\u201c at 21\u00b0 Leo in 1585, and 24\u2019 at 26 Virgo in 1587). The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 24\u2019 9\u201c. The true opposition therefore followed 2 days 3 hours 43 minutes later, on 21 February\/3 March before dawn at 2h 13m, Mars being at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 35\u201c Virgo. Forty seconds must be subtracted to reduce the position to the orbit, putting Mars at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 Virgo, with slightly less latitude than before, since the latitude was then decreasing. It was therefore about 4\u00b0 10\u2019, or 4\u00b0 7\u2153\u2019 if the parallax be neglected.\n But because, since Tycho\u2019s death, we have not made frequent observations nor continued them over several days, it would be best, for certainty\u2019s sake, also to make use of those observations which David Fabricius of East Frisia, a sedulous practitioner of astronomy, has communicated to me.\nOn February 16, old style, at 5h in the morning, he took the planet\u2019s distances from the tail of Leo (for the latitude), from the neck of Leo,30 and, on the other hand, from the bright star in the southern wing of Virgo, so as to check its longitude by working it out twice.\nI could make use of Tycho\u2019s line of reasoning, which he routinely adopted in volume I of the Progymnasmata when (as here) the declination of the planet was not known. But because that method extends to ten operations, I prefer for the sake of brevity to proceed as I did before with my own observations. Here there are no hidden dangers.\nFirst, the star in the wing of Virgo, adjusted to our time, is at 4\u00b0 36\u2019 30\u201c Libra with latitude 2\u00b0 50\u2019 north. Fabricius found that Mars is 20\u00b0 18\u2019 westward from it on the zodiac, which puts Mars at about 14\u00b0 18\u2019 30\u201c Virgo. This is a preliminary, approximate figure: the longitude will shortly be corrected. Now the tail of Leo31 is at 16\u00b0 4\u2019 Virgo, with latitude 12\u00b0 18\u2019 North, and Mars was found to be 8\u00b0 17\u2019 distant from the Tail. What is sought is the distance of its parallel from the Tail, since the difference in longitude is 1\u00b0 45\u2019. Dividing the secant of 8\u00b0 17\u2019 by the secant of 1\u00b0 45\u2019 gives the secant of 8\u00b0 6\u2019, the arc sought. This subtracted from the fixed star\u2019s northern latitude of 12\u00b0 18\u2019 leaves Mars\u2019s latitude, 4\u00b0 12\u2019 north. This I now take as determined, and compare it with the latitudes of the fixed stars according to the laws of trigonometry. From the Wing of Virgo, I find Mars\u2019s longitude to be 14\u00b0 19\u2019 Virgo; from the Neck of Leo, 14\u00b0 23\u2019 36\u201c. The mean of these two is 14\u00b0 21\u2019 18\u201c Virgo. And since the sextant gave distances larger than the truth, the latitude would come out at 4\u00b0 14\u2019 north.\nOn the night following February 23, at 12h, he observed Mars in relation to five fixed stars: the Tail of Leo and Arcturus for latitude, and for the longitude, in the first instance, Spica (which followed it), and, in the second, the Neck of Leo and Cor Leonis (which preceded it).\nBy a rough estimate, I foresee that Mars is going to fall at 11\u00bc\u00b0 Virgo. It was found to be 9\u00b0 24\u2019 from the Tail of Leo, and hence, its latitude comes out at 4\u00b0 6\u2019 ^32. And now, through this and the latitudes of the fixed stars, together with their distances (17\u00b0 26\u2019 from Regulus, 17\u00b0 51\u2019 from the Neck of Leo, 37\u00b0 28\u2019 from Spica, 44\u00b0 15\u2019 from Arcturus), Mars\u2019s position comes out at 11\u00b0 21\u2019 23\u201c Virgo (from Regulus), 11\u00b0 20\u2019 52\u201c Virgo (from the Neck of Leo), and 11\u00b0 17\u2019 40\u201c (from Spica). Again (as you see) the distances err in being too great. For from the Heart and the Neck [of Leo], Mars is pushed a little eastward, and from Spica and Arcturus a little westward, and more from Arcturus, owing to its greater northern latitude ^33. The mean (ignoring Arcturus), 11\u00b0 19\u2019 20\u201c Virgo, is very nearly true. Also, the latitude is greater, namely, 4\u00b0 7\u2019 40\u201c north. Now from February 15 at 17h to 23 February at 12h, a period of 7 days 19 hours, Mars moved 3\u00b0 0\u2019: 180 minutes in 187 hours. That is, about one minute per hour. And if you wish to take it into account, the parallax (if any) is subtracted from the longitude on February 16 and a little is added on February 23.\n Because the last observation follows the time of observation found by me by 2 days 21 hours 47 min., add the motion corresponding to this time, 1\u00b0 7\u2019: the position will come out 12\u00b0 26\u2019 Virgo. The agreement is thus very good\u2014it could not be better\u2014given that both of us [that is, Kepler and Fabricius] work independently and do not rely on the facilities used by Tycho Brahe.","1671":"VIII. On 1595 October 30 at 8h 20m, the planet was found at 17\u00b0 47\u2019 15\u201c Taurus,19 not far from the nonagesimal. We may thus be sure of the parallax, although we must take it into account. The latitude was 0\u00b0 5\u2019 10\u201c north. The sun\u2019s position was 16\u00b0 50\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio. The distance between the stars was 56\u2019 45\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 35\u201c; that of Mars, 22\u2019 54\u201c, as appears by comparing the nearby observations. The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 23\u2019 29\u201c. If the distance between the stars be divided by this, it comes out to 40\u2019 47\u201c of a day, or 16 hours 19 min. Therefore, the true opposition was 0h 39m PM on October 31. Mars\u2019s position was 17\u00b0 31\u2019 40\u201c Taurus. This needs no reduction to the orbit, as it is nearly at the node. The latitude was about 0\u00b0 8\u2019 north. But comparison with the preceding and following days shows a latitude of about 5\u2019 north.\nIX. Let, at any rate, Mars\u2019s position on 1597 December 10 at 8h 30m be 3\u00b0 45\u00bd\u2019 Cancer (as above) ^20. The sun\u2019s position was 29\u00b0 4\u2019 53\u201c Sagittarius. The distance between the stars was 4\u00b0 40\u2019 37\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 61\u2019 20\u201c, that of Mars 23\u2019 40\u201c (for in 1580 the diurnal motion in Gemini was 23\u2019, and in 1582, at 17\u00b0 Cancer, it was 24\u2019). Therefore, the sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 25\u2019 0\u201c. These data show that the time of true opposition followed 3 days 7 hours 14 min. later, on December 14 at 3h 44m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 2\u00b0 27\u2153\u2019 Cancer. The reduction to the orbit (quite ridiculous here, since the observation itself has an uncertainty of several minutes) requires the addition of about 52\u201c. Therefore, the corrected position was 2\u00b0 28\u2019 Cancer. The latitude, from the table, was 3\u00b0 33\u2019 north.\nOn the same night, the one following December 10, at 12\u2159h, Fabricius in East Frisia found Mars\u2019s position to be 3\u00b0 40\u00bc\u2019 Cancer with latitude 3\u00b0 23\u2019 N. In this observation the longitude comes out nearly the same. For the motion over 3h 40m is 3\u00bd\u2019, so that in the Brahean observation too, at 12\u2159h Mars could have been at 3\u00b0 42\u2019 Cancer\u2014two minutes beyond the Fabrician position.\nX. On 1600 January 13\/23 at 11h 40m, the time being adjusted to Uraniborg time, the planet was observed at 10\u00b0 38\u2019 46\u201c Leo ^21. The sun\u2019s position was 3\u00b0 26\u2019 30\u201c Aquarius. The stars were 7\u00b0 12\u2019 16\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion for the next few days was 1\u00b0 1\u2019 3\u201c; that of Mars, 23\u2019 44\u201c. The sum: 1\u00b0 24\u2019 47\u201c. The opposition therefore followed 5 days 2h 22m after; that is, on January 19\/29 at 2h 2m in the morning, before dawn. Mars was at 8\u00b0 38\u2019 Leo. There is no need for reduction, since it is near the limit. The latitude, from the table, was 4\u00b0 30\u2019 50\u201c N.\nXI. On the evening of 1602 Febr. 18\/28 at 10h 30m, using the Tychonic  instruments (with the help of the learned Matthias Seiffard,22 bequeathed us by Tycho), I took the distance of Mars from the middle star of the tail of Ursa Major 23 to be 52\u00b0 22\u2019. And since the distance between Cor Leonis and Procyon was 37\u00b0 22\u2019 20\u201c, which should have been 37\u00b0 19\u2019 50\u201c,24 we know that the sextant reads 2\u00bd minutes high. Therefore, the corrected distance of Mars from the tail of Ursa was 52\u00b0 19\u00bd\u2019. And since the latitude of the fixed star is 56\u00b0 22\u2019, the remainder, by subtraction, is 4\u00b0 2\u00bd\u2019\u2014supposing that Mars was at precisely the same longitude as the fixed star. But because there was a difference of 3\u00be degrees between them (as is clear from the following observations), a slight correction is required.\n For let AB be 3\u00b0 43\u2019 30\u201c on a parallel close to the ecliptic, B Mars, C the fixed star, and BC 52\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c. Dividing the secant of BC by the secant of AB gives the  secant of CA, 52\u00b0 14\u2019, which, subtracted from 56\u00b0 22\u2019 (the latitude of the fixed star) leaves 4\u00b0 8\u2019 north as Mars\u2019s observed latitude. At the same time, we found 19\u00b0 23\u2019 between Mars and Cor Leonis (19\u00b0 20\u00bd corrected), and 21\u00b0 20\u2019 between Mars and the bright star in the wing of Virgo25 (21\u00b0 17\u00bd\u2019 corrected). From these two distances (using the latitudes of the stars and Mars), Mars\u2019s longitude is found to be 13\u00b0 19\u2019 6\u201c Virgo, by consensus of all measurements.\nAlternatively, the meridian altitude of Mars was found at 12h 40m, using two quadrants, to be 50\u00b0 19\u2019, while the tail of Leo26 was 56\u00b0 45\u2019. Therefore, from the declinations and right ascensions of the fixed stars and our distances, Mars\u2019s position is determined as 13\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c Virgo, latitude 4\u00b0 7\u2019 55\u201c ^27. This is the Tychonic procedure. I have included the other for the sake of showing a consensus, and also that it might be evident that despite the lack of absolute perfection in the demonstration, short cuts either in computation or in our understanding can under certain circumstances be applied. For in that previous procedure there is less in the actual work than in the reporting of it. At Prague, 5\u00b0 Scorpio was rising ^28. Therefore, the nonagesimal was about 32\u00bd\u00b0 from the zenith. And since Mars\u2019s distance from the earth was rather more than half the sun\u2019s distance, the resulting parallax of about 5\u2019 opposite 32\u00bd\u00b0 in our parallactic table, shows a latitudinal parallax of 2\u2019 41\u201c. Thus the latitude as seen from the middle of the earth would be 4\u00b0 10\u2154\u2019 north. And because the altitude of the nonagesimal was 57\u00bd\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax at the horizon was 4\u2019 13\u201c. But since Mars was 38\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, the longitudinal parallax corresponding to this position is 2\u2019 36\u201c, and if this be eliminated, Mars would be placed at about 13\u00b0 18\u2019 Virgo ^29. At that moment, the sun\u2019s position was 10\u00b0 16\u2019 42\u201c Pisces. The distance between the bodies was 3\u00b0 1\u2019 18\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 4\u201c, and that of Mars, 24\u2019 5\u201c (for it was 24\u2019 18\u201c at 21\u00b0 Leo in 1585, and 24\u2019 at 26 Virgo in 1587). The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 24\u2019 9\u201c. The true opposition therefore followed 2 days 3 hours 43 minutes later, on 21 February\/3 March before dawn at 2h 13m, Mars being at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 35\u201c Virgo. Forty seconds must be subtracted to reduce the position to the orbit, putting Mars at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 Virgo, with slightly less latitude than before, since the latitude was then decreasing. It was therefore about 4\u00b0 10\u2019, or 4\u00b0 7\u2153\u2019 if the parallax be neglected.\n But because, since Tycho\u2019s death, we have not made frequent observations nor continued them over several days, it would be best, for certainty\u2019s sake, also to make use of those observations which David Fabricius of East Frisia, a sedulous practitioner of astronomy, has communicated to me.\nOn February 16, old style, at 5h in the morning, he took the planet\u2019s distances from the tail of Leo (for the latitude), from the neck of Leo,30 and, on the other hand, from the bright star in the southern wing of Virgo, so as to check its longitude by working it out twice.\nI could make use of Tycho\u2019s line of reasoning, which he routinely adopted in volume I of the Progymnasmata when (as here) the declination of the planet was not known. But because that method extends to ten operations, I prefer for the sake of brevity to proceed as I did before with my own observations. Here there are no hidden dangers.\nFirst, the star in the wing of Virgo, adjusted to our time, is at 4\u00b0 36\u2019 30\u201c Libra with latitude 2\u00b0 50\u2019 north. Fabricius found that Mars is 20\u00b0 18\u2019 westward from it on the zodiac, which puts Mars at about 14\u00b0 18\u2019 30\u201c Virgo. This is a preliminary, approximate figure: the longitude will shortly be corrected. Now the tail of Leo31 is at 16\u00b0 4\u2019 Virgo, with latitude 12\u00b0 18\u2019 North, and Mars was found to be 8\u00b0 17\u2019 distant from the Tail. What is sought is the distance of its parallel from the Tail, since the difference in longitude is 1\u00b0 45\u2019. Dividing the secant of 8\u00b0 17\u2019 by the secant of 1\u00b0 45\u2019 gives the secant of 8\u00b0 6\u2019, the arc sought. This subtracted from the fixed star\u2019s northern latitude of 12\u00b0 18\u2019 leaves Mars\u2019s latitude, 4\u00b0 12\u2019 north. This I now take as determined, and compare it with the latitudes of the fixed stars according to the laws of trigonometry. From the Wing of Virgo, I find Mars\u2019s longitude to be 14\u00b0 19\u2019 Virgo; from the Neck of Leo, 14\u00b0 23\u2019 36\u201c. The mean of these two is 14\u00b0 21\u2019 18\u201c Virgo. And since the sextant gave distances larger than the truth, the latitude would come out at 4\u00b0 14\u2019 north.\nOn the night following February 23, at 12h, he observed Mars in relation to five fixed stars: the Tail of Leo and Arcturus for latitude, and for the longitude, in the first instance, Spica (which followed it), and, in the second, the Neck of Leo and Cor Leonis (which preceded it).\nBy a rough estimate, I foresee that Mars is going to fall at 11\u00bc\u00b0 Virgo. It was found to be 9\u00b0 24\u2019 from the Tail of Leo, and hence, its latitude comes out at 4\u00b0 6\u2019 ^32. And now, through this and the latitudes of the fixed stars, together with their distances (17\u00b0 26\u2019 from Regulus, 17\u00b0 51\u2019 from the Neck of Leo, 37\u00b0 28\u2019 from Spica, 44\u00b0 15\u2019 from Arcturus), Mars\u2019s position comes out at 11\u00b0 21\u2019 23\u201c Virgo (from Regulus), 11\u00b0 20\u2019 52\u201c Virgo (from the Neck of Leo), and 11\u00b0 17\u2019 40\u201c (from Spica). Again (as you see) the distances err in being too great. For from the Heart and the Neck [of Leo], Mars is pushed a little eastward, and from Spica and Arcturus a little westward, and more from Arcturus, owing to its greater northern latitude ^33. The mean (ignoring Arcturus), 11\u00b0 19\u2019 20\u201c Virgo, is very nearly true. Also, the latitude is greater, namely, 4\u00b0 7\u2019 40\u201c north. Now from February 15 at 17h to 23 February at 12h, a period of 7 days 19 hours, Mars moved 3\u00b0 0\u2019: 180 minutes in 187 hours. That is, about one minute per hour. And if you wish to take it into account, the parallax (if any) is subtracted from the longitude on February 16 and a little is added on February 23.\n Because the last observation follows the time of observation found by me by 2 days 21 hours 47 min., add the motion corresponding to this time, 1\u00b0 7\u2019: the position will come out 12\u00b0 26\u2019 Virgo. The agreement is thus very good\u2014it could not be better\u2014given that both of us [that is, Kepler and Fabricius] work independently and do not rely on the facilities used by Tycho Brahe.","1672":"VIII. On 1595 October 30 at 8h 20m, the planet was found at 17\u00b0 47\u2019 15\u201c Taurus,19 not far from the nonagesimal. We may thus be sure of the parallax, although we must take it into account. The latitude was 0\u00b0 5\u2019 10\u201c north. The sun\u2019s position was 16\u00b0 50\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio. The distance between the stars was 56\u2019 45\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 35\u201c; that of Mars, 22\u2019 54\u201c, as appears by comparing the nearby observations. The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 23\u2019 29\u201c. If the distance between the stars be divided by this, it comes out to 40\u2019 47\u201c of a day, or 16 hours 19 min. Therefore, the true opposition was 0h 39m PM on October 31. Mars\u2019s position was 17\u00b0 31\u2019 40\u201c Taurus. This needs no reduction to the orbit, as it is nearly at the node. The latitude was about 0\u00b0 8\u2019 north. But comparison with the preceding and following days shows a latitude of about 5\u2019 north.\nIX. Let, at any rate, Mars\u2019s position on 1597 December 10 at 8h 30m be 3\u00b0 45\u00bd\u2019 Cancer (as above) ^20. The sun\u2019s position was 29\u00b0 4\u2019 53\u201c Sagittarius. The distance between the stars was 4\u00b0 40\u2019 37\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 61\u2019 20\u201c, that of Mars 23\u2019 40\u201c (for in 1580 the diurnal motion in Gemini was 23\u2019, and in 1582, at 17\u00b0 Cancer, it was 24\u2019). Therefore, the sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 25\u2019 0\u201c. These data show that the time of true opposition followed 3 days 7 hours 14 min. later, on December 14 at 3h 44m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 2\u00b0 27\u2153\u2019 Cancer. The reduction to the orbit (quite ridiculous here, since the observation itself has an uncertainty of several minutes) requires the addition of about 52\u201c. Therefore, the corrected position was 2\u00b0 28\u2019 Cancer. The latitude, from the table, was 3\u00b0 33\u2019 north.\nOn the same night, the one following December 10, at 12\u2159h, Fabricius in East Frisia found Mars\u2019s position to be 3\u00b0 40\u00bc\u2019 Cancer with latitude 3\u00b0 23\u2019 N. In this observation the longitude comes out nearly the same. For the motion over 3h 40m is 3\u00bd\u2019, so that in the Brahean observation too, at 12\u2159h Mars could have been at 3\u00b0 42\u2019 Cancer\u2014two minutes beyond the Fabrician position.\nX. On 1600 January 13\/23 at 11h 40m, the time being adjusted to Uraniborg time, the planet was observed at 10\u00b0 38\u2019 46\u201c Leo ^21. The sun\u2019s position was 3\u00b0 26\u2019 30\u201c Aquarius. The stars were 7\u00b0 12\u2019 16\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion for the next few days was 1\u00b0 1\u2019 3\u201c; that of Mars, 23\u2019 44\u201c. The sum: 1\u00b0 24\u2019 47\u201c. The opposition therefore followed 5 days 2h 22m after; that is, on January 19\/29 at 2h 2m in the morning, before dawn. Mars was at 8\u00b0 38\u2019 Leo. There is no need for reduction, since it is near the limit. The latitude, from the table, was 4\u00b0 30\u2019 50\u201c N.\nXI. On the evening of 1602 Febr. 18\/28 at 10h 30m, using the Tychonic  instruments (with the help of the learned Matthias Seiffard,22 bequeathed us by Tycho), I took the distance of Mars from the middle star of the tail of Ursa Major 23 to be 52\u00b0 22\u2019. And since the distance between Cor Leonis and Procyon was 37\u00b0 22\u2019 20\u201c, which should have been 37\u00b0 19\u2019 50\u201c,24 we know that the sextant reads 2\u00bd minutes high. Therefore, the corrected distance of Mars from the tail of Ursa was 52\u00b0 19\u00bd\u2019. And since the latitude of the fixed star is 56\u00b0 22\u2019, the remainder, by subtraction, is 4\u00b0 2\u00bd\u2019\u2014supposing that Mars was at precisely the same longitude as the fixed star. But because there was a difference of 3\u00be degrees between them (as is clear from the following observations), a slight correction is required.\n For let AB be 3\u00b0 43\u2019 30\u201c on a parallel close to the ecliptic, B Mars, C the fixed star, and BC 52\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c. Dividing the secant of BC by the secant of AB gives the  secant of CA, 52\u00b0 14\u2019, which, subtracted from 56\u00b0 22\u2019 (the latitude of the fixed star) leaves 4\u00b0 8\u2019 north as Mars\u2019s observed latitude. At the same time, we found 19\u00b0 23\u2019 between Mars and Cor Leonis (19\u00b0 20\u00bd corrected), and 21\u00b0 20\u2019 between Mars and the bright star in the wing of Virgo25 (21\u00b0 17\u00bd\u2019 corrected). From these two distances (using the latitudes of the stars and Mars), Mars\u2019s longitude is found to be 13\u00b0 19\u2019 6\u201c Virgo, by consensus of all measurements.\nAlternatively, the meridian altitude of Mars was found at 12h 40m, using two quadrants, to be 50\u00b0 19\u2019, while the tail of Leo26 was 56\u00b0 45\u2019. Therefore, from the declinations and right ascensions of the fixed stars and our distances, Mars\u2019s position is determined as 13\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c Virgo, latitude 4\u00b0 7\u2019 55\u201c ^27. This is the Tychonic procedure. I have included the other for the sake of showing a consensus, and also that it might be evident that despite the lack of absolute perfection in the demonstration, short cuts either in computation or in our understanding can under certain circumstances be applied. For in that previous procedure there is less in the actual work than in the reporting of it. At Prague, 5\u00b0 Scorpio was rising ^28. Therefore, the nonagesimal was about 32\u00bd\u00b0 from the zenith. And since Mars\u2019s distance from the earth was rather more than half the sun\u2019s distance, the resulting parallax of about 5\u2019 opposite 32\u00bd\u00b0 in our parallactic table, shows a latitudinal parallax of 2\u2019 41\u201c. Thus the latitude as seen from the middle of the earth would be 4\u00b0 10\u2154\u2019 north. And because the altitude of the nonagesimal was 57\u00bd\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax at the horizon was 4\u2019 13\u201c. But since Mars was 38\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, the longitudinal parallax corresponding to this position is 2\u2019 36\u201c, and if this be eliminated, Mars would be placed at about 13\u00b0 18\u2019 Virgo ^29. At that moment, the sun\u2019s position was 10\u00b0 16\u2019 42\u201c Pisces. The distance between the bodies was 3\u00b0 1\u2019 18\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 4\u201c, and that of Mars, 24\u2019 5\u201c (for it was 24\u2019 18\u201c at 21\u00b0 Leo in 1585, and 24\u2019 at 26 Virgo in 1587). The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 24\u2019 9\u201c. The true opposition therefore followed 2 days 3 hours 43 minutes later, on 21 February\/3 March before dawn at 2h 13m, Mars being at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 35\u201c Virgo. Forty seconds must be subtracted to reduce the position to the orbit, putting Mars at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 Virgo, with slightly less latitude than before, since the latitude was then decreasing. It was therefore about 4\u00b0 10\u2019, or 4\u00b0 7\u2153\u2019 if the parallax be neglected.\n But because, since Tycho\u2019s death, we have not made frequent observations nor continued them over several days, it would be best, for certainty\u2019s sake, also to make use of those observations which David Fabricius of East Frisia, a sedulous practitioner of astronomy, has communicated to me.\nOn February 16, old style, at 5h in the morning, he took the planet\u2019s distances from the tail of Leo (for the latitude), from the neck of Leo,30 and, on the other hand, from the bright star in the southern wing of Virgo, so as to check its longitude by working it out twice.\nI could make use of Tycho\u2019s line of reasoning, which he routinely adopted in volume I of the Progymnasmata when (as here) the declination of the planet was not known. But because that method extends to ten operations, I prefer for the sake of brevity to proceed as I did before with my own observations. Here there are no hidden dangers.\nFirst, the star in the wing of Virgo, adjusted to our time, is at 4\u00b0 36\u2019 30\u201c Libra with latitude 2\u00b0 50\u2019 north. Fabricius found that Mars is 20\u00b0 18\u2019 westward from it on the zodiac, which puts Mars at about 14\u00b0 18\u2019 30\u201c Virgo. This is a preliminary, approximate figure: the longitude will shortly be corrected. Now the tail of Leo31 is at 16\u00b0 4\u2019 Virgo, with latitude 12\u00b0 18\u2019 North, and Mars was found to be 8\u00b0 17\u2019 distant from the Tail. What is sought is the distance of its parallel from the Tail, since the difference in longitude is 1\u00b0 45\u2019. Dividing the secant of 8\u00b0 17\u2019 by the secant of 1\u00b0 45\u2019 gives the secant of 8\u00b0 6\u2019, the arc sought. This subtracted from the fixed star\u2019s northern latitude of 12\u00b0 18\u2019 leaves Mars\u2019s latitude, 4\u00b0 12\u2019 north. This I now take as determined, and compare it with the latitudes of the fixed stars according to the laws of trigonometry. From the Wing of Virgo, I find Mars\u2019s longitude to be 14\u00b0 19\u2019 Virgo; from the Neck of Leo, 14\u00b0 23\u2019 36\u201c. The mean of these two is 14\u00b0 21\u2019 18\u201c Virgo. And since the sextant gave distances larger than the truth, the latitude would come out at 4\u00b0 14\u2019 north.\nOn the night following February 23, at 12h, he observed Mars in relation to five fixed stars: the Tail of Leo and Arcturus for latitude, and for the longitude, in the first instance, Spica (which followed it), and, in the second, the Neck of Leo and Cor Leonis (which preceded it).\nBy a rough estimate, I foresee that Mars is going to fall at 11\u00bc\u00b0 Virgo. It was found to be 9\u00b0 24\u2019 from the Tail of Leo, and hence, its latitude comes out at 4\u00b0 6\u2019 ^32. And now, through this and the latitudes of the fixed stars, together with their distances (17\u00b0 26\u2019 from Regulus, 17\u00b0 51\u2019 from the Neck of Leo, 37\u00b0 28\u2019 from Spica, 44\u00b0 15\u2019 from Arcturus), Mars\u2019s position comes out at 11\u00b0 21\u2019 23\u201c Virgo (from Regulus), 11\u00b0 20\u2019 52\u201c Virgo (from the Neck of Leo), and 11\u00b0 17\u2019 40\u201c (from Spica). Again (as you see) the distances err in being too great. For from the Heart and the Neck [of Leo], Mars is pushed a little eastward, and from Spica and Arcturus a little westward, and more from Arcturus, owing to its greater northern latitude ^33. The mean (ignoring Arcturus), 11\u00b0 19\u2019 20\u201c Virgo, is very nearly true. Also, the latitude is greater, namely, 4\u00b0 7\u2019 40\u201c north. Now from February 15 at 17h to 23 February at 12h, a period of 7 days 19 hours, Mars moved 3\u00b0 0\u2019: 180 minutes in 187 hours. That is, about one minute per hour. And if you wish to take it into account, the parallax (if any) is subtracted from the longitude on February 16 and a little is added on February 23.\n Because the last observation follows the time of observation found by me by 2 days 21 hours 47 min., add the motion corresponding to this time, 1\u00b0 7\u2019: the position will come out 12\u00b0 26\u2019 Virgo. The agreement is thus very good\u2014it could not be better\u2014given that both of us [that is, Kepler and Fabricius] work independently and do not rely on the facilities used by Tycho Brahe.","1673":"VIII. On 1595 October 30 at 8h 20m, the planet was found at 17\u00b0 47\u2019 15\u201c Taurus,19 not far from the nonagesimal. We may thus be sure of the parallax, although we must take it into account. The latitude was 0\u00b0 5\u2019 10\u201c north. The sun\u2019s position was 16\u00b0 50\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio. The distance between the stars was 56\u2019 45\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 35\u201c; that of Mars, 22\u2019 54\u201c, as appears by comparing the nearby observations. The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 23\u2019 29\u201c. If the distance between the stars be divided by this, it comes out to 40\u2019 47\u201c of a day, or 16 hours 19 min. Therefore, the true opposition was 0h 39m PM on October 31. Mars\u2019s position was 17\u00b0 31\u2019 40\u201c Taurus. This needs no reduction to the orbit, as it is nearly at the node. The latitude was about 0\u00b0 8\u2019 north. But comparison with the preceding and following days shows a latitude of about 5\u2019 north.\nIX. Let, at any rate, Mars\u2019s position on 1597 December 10 at 8h 30m be 3\u00b0 45\u00bd\u2019 Cancer (as above) ^20. The sun\u2019s position was 29\u00b0 4\u2019 53\u201c Sagittarius. The distance between the stars was 4\u00b0 40\u2019 37\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 61\u2019 20\u201c, that of Mars 23\u2019 40\u201c (for in 1580 the diurnal motion in Gemini was 23\u2019, and in 1582, at 17\u00b0 Cancer, it was 24\u2019). Therefore, the sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 25\u2019 0\u201c. These data show that the time of true opposition followed 3 days 7 hours 14 min. later, on December 14 at 3h 44m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 2\u00b0 27\u2153\u2019 Cancer. The reduction to the orbit (quite ridiculous here, since the observation itself has an uncertainty of several minutes) requires the addition of about 52\u201c. Therefore, the corrected position was 2\u00b0 28\u2019 Cancer. The latitude, from the table, was 3\u00b0 33\u2019 north.\nOn the same night, the one following December 10, at 12\u2159h, Fabricius in East Frisia found Mars\u2019s position to be 3\u00b0 40\u00bc\u2019 Cancer with latitude 3\u00b0 23\u2019 N. In this observation the longitude comes out nearly the same. For the motion over 3h 40m is 3\u00bd\u2019, so that in the Brahean observation too, at 12\u2159h Mars could have been at 3\u00b0 42\u2019 Cancer\u2014two minutes beyond the Fabrician position.\nX. On 1600 January 13\/23 at 11h 40m, the time being adjusted to Uraniborg time, the planet was observed at 10\u00b0 38\u2019 46\u201c Leo ^21. The sun\u2019s position was 3\u00b0 26\u2019 30\u201c Aquarius. The stars were 7\u00b0 12\u2019 16\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion for the next few days was 1\u00b0 1\u2019 3\u201c; that of Mars, 23\u2019 44\u201c. The sum: 1\u00b0 24\u2019 47\u201c. The opposition therefore followed 5 days 2h 22m after; that is, on January 19\/29 at 2h 2m in the morning, before dawn. Mars was at 8\u00b0 38\u2019 Leo. There is no need for reduction, since it is near the limit. The latitude, from the table, was 4\u00b0 30\u2019 50\u201c N.\nXI. On the evening of 1602 Febr. 18\/28 at 10h 30m, using the Tychonic  instruments (with the help of the learned Matthias Seiffard,22 bequeathed us by Tycho), I took the distance of Mars from the middle star of the tail of Ursa Major 23 to be 52\u00b0 22\u2019. And since the distance between Cor Leonis and Procyon was 37\u00b0 22\u2019 20\u201c, which should have been 37\u00b0 19\u2019 50\u201c,24 we know that the sextant reads 2\u00bd minutes high. Therefore, the corrected distance of Mars from the tail of Ursa was 52\u00b0 19\u00bd\u2019. And since the latitude of the fixed star is 56\u00b0 22\u2019, the remainder, by subtraction, is 4\u00b0 2\u00bd\u2019\u2014supposing that Mars was at precisely the same longitude as the fixed star. But because there was a difference of 3\u00be degrees between them (as is clear from the following observations), a slight correction is required.\n For let AB be 3\u00b0 43\u2019 30\u201c on a parallel close to the ecliptic, B Mars, C the fixed star, and BC 52\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c. Dividing the secant of BC by the secant of AB gives the  secant of CA, 52\u00b0 14\u2019, which, subtracted from 56\u00b0 22\u2019 (the latitude of the fixed star) leaves 4\u00b0 8\u2019 north as Mars\u2019s observed latitude. At the same time, we found 19\u00b0 23\u2019 between Mars and Cor Leonis (19\u00b0 20\u00bd corrected), and 21\u00b0 20\u2019 between Mars and the bright star in the wing of Virgo25 (21\u00b0 17\u00bd\u2019 corrected). From these two distances (using the latitudes of the stars and Mars), Mars\u2019s longitude is found to be 13\u00b0 19\u2019 6\u201c Virgo, by consensus of all measurements.\nAlternatively, the meridian altitude of Mars was found at 12h 40m, using two quadrants, to be 50\u00b0 19\u2019, while the tail of Leo26 was 56\u00b0 45\u2019. Therefore, from the declinations and right ascensions of the fixed stars and our distances, Mars\u2019s position is determined as 13\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c Virgo, latitude 4\u00b0 7\u2019 55\u201c ^27. This is the Tychonic procedure. I have included the other for the sake of showing a consensus, and also that it might be evident that despite the lack of absolute perfection in the demonstration, short cuts either in computation or in our understanding can under certain circumstances be applied. For in that previous procedure there is less in the actual work than in the reporting of it. At Prague, 5\u00b0 Scorpio was rising ^28. Therefore, the nonagesimal was about 32\u00bd\u00b0 from the zenith. And since Mars\u2019s distance from the earth was rather more than half the sun\u2019s distance, the resulting parallax of about 5\u2019 opposite 32\u00bd\u00b0 in our parallactic table, shows a latitudinal parallax of 2\u2019 41\u201c. Thus the latitude as seen from the middle of the earth would be 4\u00b0 10\u2154\u2019 north. And because the altitude of the nonagesimal was 57\u00bd\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax at the horizon was 4\u2019 13\u201c. But since Mars was 38\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, the longitudinal parallax corresponding to this position is 2\u2019 36\u201c, and if this be eliminated, Mars would be placed at about 13\u00b0 18\u2019 Virgo ^29. At that moment, the sun\u2019s position was 10\u00b0 16\u2019 42\u201c Pisces. The distance between the bodies was 3\u00b0 1\u2019 18\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 4\u201c, and that of Mars, 24\u2019 5\u201c (for it was 24\u2019 18\u201c at 21\u00b0 Leo in 1585, and 24\u2019 at 26 Virgo in 1587). The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 24\u2019 9\u201c. The true opposition therefore followed 2 days 3 hours 43 minutes later, on 21 February\/3 March before dawn at 2h 13m, Mars being at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 35\u201c Virgo. Forty seconds must be subtracted to reduce the position to the orbit, putting Mars at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 Virgo, with slightly less latitude than before, since the latitude was then decreasing. It was therefore about 4\u00b0 10\u2019, or 4\u00b0 7\u2153\u2019 if the parallax be neglected.\n But because, since Tycho\u2019s death, we have not made frequent observations nor continued them over several days, it would be best, for certainty\u2019s sake, also to make use of those observations which David Fabricius of East Frisia, a sedulous practitioner of astronomy, has communicated to me.\nOn February 16, old style, at 5h in the morning, he took the planet\u2019s distances from the tail of Leo (for the latitude), from the neck of Leo,30 and, on the other hand, from the bright star in the southern wing of Virgo, so as to check its longitude by working it out twice.\nI could make use of Tycho\u2019s line of reasoning, which he routinely adopted in volume I of the Progymnasmata when (as here) the declination of the planet was not known. But because that method extends to ten operations, I prefer for the sake of brevity to proceed as I did before with my own observations. Here there are no hidden dangers.\nFirst, the star in the wing of Virgo, adjusted to our time, is at 4\u00b0 36\u2019 30\u201c Libra with latitude 2\u00b0 50\u2019 north. Fabricius found that Mars is 20\u00b0 18\u2019 westward from it on the zodiac, which puts Mars at about 14\u00b0 18\u2019 30\u201c Virgo. This is a preliminary, approximate figure: the longitude will shortly be corrected. Now the tail of Leo31 is at 16\u00b0 4\u2019 Virgo, with latitude 12\u00b0 18\u2019 North, and Mars was found to be 8\u00b0 17\u2019 distant from the Tail. What is sought is the distance of its parallel from the Tail, since the difference in longitude is 1\u00b0 45\u2019. Dividing the secant of 8\u00b0 17\u2019 by the secant of 1\u00b0 45\u2019 gives the secant of 8\u00b0 6\u2019, the arc sought. This subtracted from the fixed star\u2019s northern latitude of 12\u00b0 18\u2019 leaves Mars\u2019s latitude, 4\u00b0 12\u2019 north. This I now take as determined, and compare it with the latitudes of the fixed stars according to the laws of trigonometry. From the Wing of Virgo, I find Mars\u2019s longitude to be 14\u00b0 19\u2019 Virgo; from the Neck of Leo, 14\u00b0 23\u2019 36\u201c. The mean of these two is 14\u00b0 21\u2019 18\u201c Virgo. And since the sextant gave distances larger than the truth, the latitude would come out at 4\u00b0 14\u2019 north.\nOn the night following February 23, at 12h, he observed Mars in relation to five fixed stars: the Tail of Leo and Arcturus for latitude, and for the longitude, in the first instance, Spica (which followed it), and, in the second, the Neck of Leo and Cor Leonis (which preceded it).\nBy a rough estimate, I foresee that Mars is going to fall at 11\u00bc\u00b0 Virgo. It was found to be 9\u00b0 24\u2019 from the Tail of Leo, and hence, its latitude comes out at 4\u00b0 6\u2019 ^32. And now, through this and the latitudes of the fixed stars, together with their distances (17\u00b0 26\u2019 from Regulus, 17\u00b0 51\u2019 from the Neck of Leo, 37\u00b0 28\u2019 from Spica, 44\u00b0 15\u2019 from Arcturus), Mars\u2019s position comes out at 11\u00b0 21\u2019 23\u201c Virgo (from Regulus), 11\u00b0 20\u2019 52\u201c Virgo (from the Neck of Leo), and 11\u00b0 17\u2019 40\u201c (from Spica). Again (as you see) the distances err in being too great. For from the Heart and the Neck [of Leo], Mars is pushed a little eastward, and from Spica and Arcturus a little westward, and more from Arcturus, owing to its greater northern latitude ^33. The mean (ignoring Arcturus), 11\u00b0 19\u2019 20\u201c Virgo, is very nearly true. Also, the latitude is greater, namely, 4\u00b0 7\u2019 40\u201c north. Now from February 15 at 17h to 23 February at 12h, a period of 7 days 19 hours, Mars moved 3\u00b0 0\u2019: 180 minutes in 187 hours. That is, about one minute per hour. And if you wish to take it into account, the parallax (if any) is subtracted from the longitude on February 16 and a little is added on February 23.\n Because the last observation follows the time of observation found by me by 2 days 21 hours 47 min., add the motion corresponding to this time, 1\u00b0 7\u2019: the position will come out 12\u00b0 26\u2019 Virgo. The agreement is thus very good\u2014it could not be better\u2014given that both of us [that is, Kepler and Fabricius] work independently and do not rely on the facilities used by Tycho Brahe.","1674":"VIII. On 1595 October 30 at 8h 20m, the planet was found at 17\u00b0 47\u2019 15\u201c Taurus,19 not far from the nonagesimal. We may thus be sure of the parallax, although we must take it into account. The latitude was 0\u00b0 5\u2019 10\u201c north. The sun\u2019s position was 16\u00b0 50\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio. The distance between the stars was 56\u2019 45\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 35\u201c; that of Mars, 22\u2019 54\u201c, as appears by comparing the nearby observations. The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 23\u2019 29\u201c. If the distance between the stars be divided by this, it comes out to 40\u2019 47\u201c of a day, or 16 hours 19 min. Therefore, the true opposition was 0h 39m PM on October 31. Mars\u2019s position was 17\u00b0 31\u2019 40\u201c Taurus. This needs no reduction to the orbit, as it is nearly at the node. The latitude was about 0\u00b0 8\u2019 north. But comparison with the preceding and following days shows a latitude of about 5\u2019 north.\nIX. Let, at any rate, Mars\u2019s position on 1597 December 10 at 8h 30m be 3\u00b0 45\u00bd\u2019 Cancer (as above) ^20. The sun\u2019s position was 29\u00b0 4\u2019 53\u201c Sagittarius. The distance between the stars was 4\u00b0 40\u2019 37\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 61\u2019 20\u201c, that of Mars 23\u2019 40\u201c (for in 1580 the diurnal motion in Gemini was 23\u2019, and in 1582, at 17\u00b0 Cancer, it was 24\u2019). Therefore, the sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 25\u2019 0\u201c. These data show that the time of true opposition followed 3 days 7 hours 14 min. later, on December 14 at 3h 44m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 2\u00b0 27\u2153\u2019 Cancer. The reduction to the orbit (quite ridiculous here, since the observation itself has an uncertainty of several minutes) requires the addition of about 52\u201c. Therefore, the corrected position was 2\u00b0 28\u2019 Cancer. The latitude, from the table, was 3\u00b0 33\u2019 north.\nOn the same night, the one following December 10, at 12\u2159h, Fabricius in East Frisia found Mars\u2019s position to be 3\u00b0 40\u00bc\u2019 Cancer with latitude 3\u00b0 23\u2019 N. In this observation the longitude comes out nearly the same. For the motion over 3h 40m is 3\u00bd\u2019, so that in the Brahean observation too, at 12\u2159h Mars could have been at 3\u00b0 42\u2019 Cancer\u2014two minutes beyond the Fabrician position.\nX. On 1600 January 13\/23 at 11h 40m, the time being adjusted to Uraniborg time, the planet was observed at 10\u00b0 38\u2019 46\u201c Leo ^21. The sun\u2019s position was 3\u00b0 26\u2019 30\u201c Aquarius. The stars were 7\u00b0 12\u2019 16\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion for the next few days was 1\u00b0 1\u2019 3\u201c; that of Mars, 23\u2019 44\u201c. The sum: 1\u00b0 24\u2019 47\u201c. The opposition therefore followed 5 days 2h 22m after; that is, on January 19\/29 at 2h 2m in the morning, before dawn. Mars was at 8\u00b0 38\u2019 Leo. There is no need for reduction, since it is near the limit. The latitude, from the table, was 4\u00b0 30\u2019 50\u201c N.\nXI. On the evening of 1602 Febr. 18\/28 at 10h 30m, using the Tychonic  instruments (with the help of the learned Matthias Seiffard,22 bequeathed us by Tycho), I took the distance of Mars from the middle star of the tail of Ursa Major 23 to be 52\u00b0 22\u2019. And since the distance between Cor Leonis and Procyon was 37\u00b0 22\u2019 20\u201c, which should have been 37\u00b0 19\u2019 50\u201c,24 we know that the sextant reads 2\u00bd minutes high. Therefore, the corrected distance of Mars from the tail of Ursa was 52\u00b0 19\u00bd\u2019. And since the latitude of the fixed star is 56\u00b0 22\u2019, the remainder, by subtraction, is 4\u00b0 2\u00bd\u2019\u2014supposing that Mars was at precisely the same longitude as the fixed star. But because there was a difference of 3\u00be degrees between them (as is clear from the following observations), a slight correction is required.\n For let AB be 3\u00b0 43\u2019 30\u201c on a parallel close to the ecliptic, B Mars, C the fixed star, and BC 52\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c. Dividing the secant of BC by the secant of AB gives the  secant of CA, 52\u00b0 14\u2019, which, subtracted from 56\u00b0 22\u2019 (the latitude of the fixed star) leaves 4\u00b0 8\u2019 north as Mars\u2019s observed latitude. At the same time, we found 19\u00b0 23\u2019 between Mars and Cor Leonis (19\u00b0 20\u00bd corrected), and 21\u00b0 20\u2019 between Mars and the bright star in the wing of Virgo25 (21\u00b0 17\u00bd\u2019 corrected). From these two distances (using the latitudes of the stars and Mars), Mars\u2019s longitude is found to be 13\u00b0 19\u2019 6\u201c Virgo, by consensus of all measurements.\nAlternatively, the meridian altitude of Mars was found at 12h 40m, using two quadrants, to be 50\u00b0 19\u2019, while the tail of Leo26 was 56\u00b0 45\u2019. Therefore, from the declinations and right ascensions of the fixed stars and our distances, Mars\u2019s position is determined as 13\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c Virgo, latitude 4\u00b0 7\u2019 55\u201c ^27. This is the Tychonic procedure. I have included the other for the sake of showing a consensus, and also that it might be evident that despite the lack of absolute perfection in the demonstration, short cuts either in computation or in our understanding can under certain circumstances be applied. For in that previous procedure there is less in the actual work than in the reporting of it. At Prague, 5\u00b0 Scorpio was rising ^28. Therefore, the nonagesimal was about 32\u00bd\u00b0 from the zenith. And since Mars\u2019s distance from the earth was rather more than half the sun\u2019s distance, the resulting parallax of about 5\u2019 opposite 32\u00bd\u00b0 in our parallactic table, shows a latitudinal parallax of 2\u2019 41\u201c. Thus the latitude as seen from the middle of the earth would be 4\u00b0 10\u2154\u2019 north. And because the altitude of the nonagesimal was 57\u00bd\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax at the horizon was 4\u2019 13\u201c. But since Mars was 38\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, the longitudinal parallax corresponding to this position is 2\u2019 36\u201c, and if this be eliminated, Mars would be placed at about 13\u00b0 18\u2019 Virgo ^29. At that moment, the sun\u2019s position was 10\u00b0 16\u2019 42\u201c Pisces. The distance between the bodies was 3\u00b0 1\u2019 18\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 4\u201c, and that of Mars, 24\u2019 5\u201c (for it was 24\u2019 18\u201c at 21\u00b0 Leo in 1585, and 24\u2019 at 26 Virgo in 1587). The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 24\u2019 9\u201c. The true opposition therefore followed 2 days 3 hours 43 minutes later, on 21 February\/3 March before dawn at 2h 13m, Mars being at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 35\u201c Virgo. Forty seconds must be subtracted to reduce the position to the orbit, putting Mars at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 Virgo, with slightly less latitude than before, since the latitude was then decreasing. It was therefore about 4\u00b0 10\u2019, or 4\u00b0 7\u2153\u2019 if the parallax be neglected.\n But because, since Tycho\u2019s death, we have not made frequent observations nor continued them over several days, it would be best, for certainty\u2019s sake, also to make use of those observations which David Fabricius of East Frisia, a sedulous practitioner of astronomy, has communicated to me.\nOn February 16, old style, at 5h in the morning, he took the planet\u2019s distances from the tail of Leo (for the latitude), from the neck of Leo,30 and, on the other hand, from the bright star in the southern wing of Virgo, so as to check its longitude by working it out twice.\nI could make use of Tycho\u2019s line of reasoning, which he routinely adopted in volume I of the Progymnasmata when (as here) the declination of the planet was not known. But because that method extends to ten operations, I prefer for the sake of brevity to proceed as I did before with my own observations. Here there are no hidden dangers.\nFirst, the star in the wing of Virgo, adjusted to our time, is at 4\u00b0 36\u2019 30\u201c Libra with latitude 2\u00b0 50\u2019 north. Fabricius found that Mars is 20\u00b0 18\u2019 westward from it on the zodiac, which puts Mars at about 14\u00b0 18\u2019 30\u201c Virgo. This is a preliminary, approximate figure: the longitude will shortly be corrected. Now the tail of Leo31 is at 16\u00b0 4\u2019 Virgo, with latitude 12\u00b0 18\u2019 North, and Mars was found to be 8\u00b0 17\u2019 distant from the Tail. What is sought is the distance of its parallel from the Tail, since the difference in longitude is 1\u00b0 45\u2019. Dividing the secant of 8\u00b0 17\u2019 by the secant of 1\u00b0 45\u2019 gives the secant of 8\u00b0 6\u2019, the arc sought. This subtracted from the fixed star\u2019s northern latitude of 12\u00b0 18\u2019 leaves Mars\u2019s latitude, 4\u00b0 12\u2019 north. This I now take as determined, and compare it with the latitudes of the fixed stars according to the laws of trigonometry. From the Wing of Virgo, I find Mars\u2019s longitude to be 14\u00b0 19\u2019 Virgo; from the Neck of Leo, 14\u00b0 23\u2019 36\u201c. The mean of these two is 14\u00b0 21\u2019 18\u201c Virgo. And since the sextant gave distances larger than the truth, the latitude would come out at 4\u00b0 14\u2019 north.\nOn the night following February 23, at 12h, he observed Mars in relation to five fixed stars: the Tail of Leo and Arcturus for latitude, and for the longitude, in the first instance, Spica (which followed it), and, in the second, the Neck of Leo and Cor Leonis (which preceded it).\nBy a rough estimate, I foresee that Mars is going to fall at 11\u00bc\u00b0 Virgo. It was found to be 9\u00b0 24\u2019 from the Tail of Leo, and hence, its latitude comes out at 4\u00b0 6\u2019 ^32. And now, through this and the latitudes of the fixed stars, together with their distances (17\u00b0 26\u2019 from Regulus, 17\u00b0 51\u2019 from the Neck of Leo, 37\u00b0 28\u2019 from Spica, 44\u00b0 15\u2019 from Arcturus), Mars\u2019s position comes out at 11\u00b0 21\u2019 23\u201c Virgo (from Regulus), 11\u00b0 20\u2019 52\u201c Virgo (from the Neck of Leo), and 11\u00b0 17\u2019 40\u201c (from Spica). Again (as you see) the distances err in being too great. For from the Heart and the Neck [of Leo], Mars is pushed a little eastward, and from Spica and Arcturus a little westward, and more from Arcturus, owing to its greater northern latitude ^33. The mean (ignoring Arcturus), 11\u00b0 19\u2019 20\u201c Virgo, is very nearly true. Also, the latitude is greater, namely, 4\u00b0 7\u2019 40\u201c north. Now from February 15 at 17h to 23 February at 12h, a period of 7 days 19 hours, Mars moved 3\u00b0 0\u2019: 180 minutes in 187 hours. That is, about one minute per hour. And if you wish to take it into account, the parallax (if any) is subtracted from the longitude on February 16 and a little is added on February 23.\n Because the last observation follows the time of observation found by me by 2 days 21 hours 47 min., add the motion corresponding to this time, 1\u00b0 7\u2019: the position will come out 12\u00b0 26\u2019 Virgo. The agreement is thus very good\u2014it could not be better\u2014given that both of us [that is, Kepler and Fabricius] work independently and do not rely on the facilities used by Tycho Brahe.","1675":"VIII. On 1595 October 30 at 8h 20m, the planet was found at 17\u00b0 47\u2019 15\u201c Taurus,19 not far from the nonagesimal. We may thus be sure of the parallax, although we must take it into account. The latitude was 0\u00b0 5\u2019 10\u201c north. The sun\u2019s position was 16\u00b0 50\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio. The distance between the stars was 56\u2019 45\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 35\u201c; that of Mars, 22\u2019 54\u201c, as appears by comparing the nearby observations. The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 23\u2019 29\u201c. If the distance between the stars be divided by this, it comes out to 40\u2019 47\u201c of a day, or 16 hours 19 min. Therefore, the true opposition was 0h 39m PM on October 31. Mars\u2019s position was 17\u00b0 31\u2019 40\u201c Taurus. This needs no reduction to the orbit, as it is nearly at the node. The latitude was about 0\u00b0 8\u2019 north. But comparison with the preceding and following days shows a latitude of about 5\u2019 north.\nIX. Let, at any rate, Mars\u2019s position on 1597 December 10 at 8h 30m be 3\u00b0 45\u00bd\u2019 Cancer (as above) ^20. The sun\u2019s position was 29\u00b0 4\u2019 53\u201c Sagittarius. The distance between the stars was 4\u00b0 40\u2019 37\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 61\u2019 20\u201c, that of Mars 23\u2019 40\u201c (for in 1580 the diurnal motion in Gemini was 23\u2019, and in 1582, at 17\u00b0 Cancer, it was 24\u2019). Therefore, the sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 25\u2019 0\u201c. These data show that the time of true opposition followed 3 days 7 hours 14 min. later, on December 14 at 3h 44m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 2\u00b0 27\u2153\u2019 Cancer. The reduction to the orbit (quite ridiculous here, since the observation itself has an uncertainty of several minutes) requires the addition of about 52\u201c. Therefore, the corrected position was 2\u00b0 28\u2019 Cancer. The latitude, from the table, was 3\u00b0 33\u2019 north.\nOn the same night, the one following December 10, at 12\u2159h, Fabricius in East Frisia found Mars\u2019s position to be 3\u00b0 40\u00bc\u2019 Cancer with latitude 3\u00b0 23\u2019 N. In this observation the longitude comes out nearly the same. For the motion over 3h 40m is 3\u00bd\u2019, so that in the Brahean observation too, at 12\u2159h Mars could have been at 3\u00b0 42\u2019 Cancer\u2014two minutes beyond the Fabrician position.\nX. On 1600 January 13\/23 at 11h 40m, the time being adjusted to Uraniborg time, the planet was observed at 10\u00b0 38\u2019 46\u201c Leo ^21. The sun\u2019s position was 3\u00b0 26\u2019 30\u201c Aquarius. The stars were 7\u00b0 12\u2019 16\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion for the next few days was 1\u00b0 1\u2019 3\u201c; that of Mars, 23\u2019 44\u201c. The sum: 1\u00b0 24\u2019 47\u201c. The opposition therefore followed 5 days 2h 22m after; that is, on January 19\/29 at 2h 2m in the morning, before dawn. Mars was at 8\u00b0 38\u2019 Leo. There is no need for reduction, since it is near the limit. The latitude, from the table, was 4\u00b0 30\u2019 50\u201c N.\nXI. On the evening of 1602 Febr. 18\/28 at 10h 30m, using the Tychonic  instruments (with the help of the learned Matthias Seiffard,22 bequeathed us by Tycho), I took the distance of Mars from the middle star of the tail of Ursa Major 23 to be 52\u00b0 22\u2019. And since the distance between Cor Leonis and Procyon was 37\u00b0 22\u2019 20\u201c, which should have been 37\u00b0 19\u2019 50\u201c,24 we know that the sextant reads 2\u00bd minutes high. Therefore, the corrected distance of Mars from the tail of Ursa was 52\u00b0 19\u00bd\u2019. And since the latitude of the fixed star is 56\u00b0 22\u2019, the remainder, by subtraction, is 4\u00b0 2\u00bd\u2019\u2014supposing that Mars was at precisely the same longitude as the fixed star. But because there was a difference of 3\u00be degrees between them (as is clear from the following observations), a slight correction is required.\n For let AB be 3\u00b0 43\u2019 30\u201c on a parallel close to the ecliptic, B Mars, C the fixed star, and BC 52\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c. Dividing the secant of BC by the secant of AB gives the  secant of CA, 52\u00b0 14\u2019, which, subtracted from 56\u00b0 22\u2019 (the latitude of the fixed star) leaves 4\u00b0 8\u2019 north as Mars\u2019s observed latitude. At the same time, we found 19\u00b0 23\u2019 between Mars and Cor Leonis (19\u00b0 20\u00bd corrected), and 21\u00b0 20\u2019 between Mars and the bright star in the wing of Virgo25 (21\u00b0 17\u00bd\u2019 corrected). From these two distances (using the latitudes of the stars and Mars), Mars\u2019s longitude is found to be 13\u00b0 19\u2019 6\u201c Virgo, by consensus of all measurements.\nAlternatively, the meridian altitude of Mars was found at 12h 40m, using two quadrants, to be 50\u00b0 19\u2019, while the tail of Leo26 was 56\u00b0 45\u2019. Therefore, from the declinations and right ascensions of the fixed stars and our distances, Mars\u2019s position is determined as 13\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c Virgo, latitude 4\u00b0 7\u2019 55\u201c ^27. This is the Tychonic procedure. I have included the other for the sake of showing a consensus, and also that it might be evident that despite the lack of absolute perfection in the demonstration, short cuts either in computation or in our understanding can under certain circumstances be applied. For in that previous procedure there is less in the actual work than in the reporting of it. At Prague, 5\u00b0 Scorpio was rising ^28. Therefore, the nonagesimal was about 32\u00bd\u00b0 from the zenith. And since Mars\u2019s distance from the earth was rather more than half the sun\u2019s distance, the resulting parallax of about 5\u2019 opposite 32\u00bd\u00b0 in our parallactic table, shows a latitudinal parallax of 2\u2019 41\u201c. Thus the latitude as seen from the middle of the earth would be 4\u00b0 10\u2154\u2019 north. And because the altitude of the nonagesimal was 57\u00bd\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax at the horizon was 4\u2019 13\u201c. But since Mars was 38\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, the longitudinal parallax corresponding to this position is 2\u2019 36\u201c, and if this be eliminated, Mars would be placed at about 13\u00b0 18\u2019 Virgo ^29. At that moment, the sun\u2019s position was 10\u00b0 16\u2019 42\u201c Pisces. The distance between the bodies was 3\u00b0 1\u2019 18\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 4\u201c, and that of Mars, 24\u2019 5\u201c (for it was 24\u2019 18\u201c at 21\u00b0 Leo in 1585, and 24\u2019 at 26 Virgo in 1587). The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 24\u2019 9\u201c. The true opposition therefore followed 2 days 3 hours 43 minutes later, on 21 February\/3 March before dawn at 2h 13m, Mars being at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 35\u201c Virgo. Forty seconds must be subtracted to reduce the position to the orbit, putting Mars at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 Virgo, with slightly less latitude than before, since the latitude was then decreasing. It was therefore about 4\u00b0 10\u2019, or 4\u00b0 7\u2153\u2019 if the parallax be neglected.\n But because, since Tycho\u2019s death, we have not made frequent observations nor continued them over several days, it would be best, for certainty\u2019s sake, also to make use of those observations which David Fabricius of East Frisia, a sedulous practitioner of astronomy, has communicated to me.\nOn February 16, old style, at 5h in the morning, he took the planet\u2019s distances from the tail of Leo (for the latitude), from the neck of Leo,30 and, on the other hand, from the bright star in the southern wing of Virgo, so as to check its longitude by working it out twice.\nI could make use of Tycho\u2019s line of reasoning, which he routinely adopted in volume I of the Progymnasmata when (as here) the declination of the planet was not known. But because that method extends to ten operations, I prefer for the sake of brevity to proceed as I did before with my own observations. Here there are no hidden dangers.\nFirst, the star in the wing of Virgo, adjusted to our time, is at 4\u00b0 36\u2019 30\u201c Libra with latitude 2\u00b0 50\u2019 north. Fabricius found that Mars is 20\u00b0 18\u2019 westward from it on the zodiac, which puts Mars at about 14\u00b0 18\u2019 30\u201c Virgo. This is a preliminary, approximate figure: the longitude will shortly be corrected. Now the tail of Leo31 is at 16\u00b0 4\u2019 Virgo, with latitude 12\u00b0 18\u2019 North, and Mars was found to be 8\u00b0 17\u2019 distant from the Tail. What is sought is the distance of its parallel from the Tail, since the difference in longitude is 1\u00b0 45\u2019. Dividing the secant of 8\u00b0 17\u2019 by the secant of 1\u00b0 45\u2019 gives the secant of 8\u00b0 6\u2019, the arc sought. This subtracted from the fixed star\u2019s northern latitude of 12\u00b0 18\u2019 leaves Mars\u2019s latitude, 4\u00b0 12\u2019 north. This I now take as determined, and compare it with the latitudes of the fixed stars according to the laws of trigonometry. From the Wing of Virgo, I find Mars\u2019s longitude to be 14\u00b0 19\u2019 Virgo; from the Neck of Leo, 14\u00b0 23\u2019 36\u201c. The mean of these two is 14\u00b0 21\u2019 18\u201c Virgo. And since the sextant gave distances larger than the truth, the latitude would come out at 4\u00b0 14\u2019 north.\nOn the night following February 23, at 12h, he observed Mars in relation to five fixed stars: the Tail of Leo and Arcturus for latitude, and for the longitude, in the first instance, Spica (which followed it), and, in the second, the Neck of Leo and Cor Leonis (which preceded it).\nBy a rough estimate, I foresee that Mars is going to fall at 11\u00bc\u00b0 Virgo. It was found to be 9\u00b0 24\u2019 from the Tail of Leo, and hence, its latitude comes out at 4\u00b0 6\u2019 ^32. And now, through this and the latitudes of the fixed stars, together with their distances (17\u00b0 26\u2019 from Regulus, 17\u00b0 51\u2019 from the Neck of Leo, 37\u00b0 28\u2019 from Spica, 44\u00b0 15\u2019 from Arcturus), Mars\u2019s position comes out at 11\u00b0 21\u2019 23\u201c Virgo (from Regulus), 11\u00b0 20\u2019 52\u201c Virgo (from the Neck of Leo), and 11\u00b0 17\u2019 40\u201c (from Spica). Again (as you see) the distances err in being too great. For from the Heart and the Neck [of Leo], Mars is pushed a little eastward, and from Spica and Arcturus a little westward, and more from Arcturus, owing to its greater northern latitude ^33. The mean (ignoring Arcturus), 11\u00b0 19\u2019 20\u201c Virgo, is very nearly true. Also, the latitude is greater, namely, 4\u00b0 7\u2019 40\u201c north. Now from February 15 at 17h to 23 February at 12h, a period of 7 days 19 hours, Mars moved 3\u00b0 0\u2019: 180 minutes in 187 hours. That is, about one minute per hour. And if you wish to take it into account, the parallax (if any) is subtracted from the longitude on February 16 and a little is added on February 23.\n Because the last observation follows the time of observation found by me by 2 days 21 hours 47 min., add the motion corresponding to this time, 1\u00b0 7\u2019: the position will come out 12\u00b0 26\u2019 Virgo. The agreement is thus very good\u2014it could not be better\u2014given that both of us [that is, Kepler and Fabricius] work independently and do not rely on the facilities used by Tycho Brahe.","1676":"VIII. On 1595 October 30 at 8h 20m, the planet was found at 17\u00b0 47\u2019 15\u201c Taurus,19 not far from the nonagesimal. We may thus be sure of the parallax, although we must take it into account. The latitude was 0\u00b0 5\u2019 10\u201c north. The sun\u2019s position was 16\u00b0 50\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio. The distance between the stars was 56\u2019 45\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 35\u201c; that of Mars, 22\u2019 54\u201c, as appears by comparing the nearby observations. The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 23\u2019 29\u201c. If the distance between the stars be divided by this, it comes out to 40\u2019 47\u201c of a day, or 16 hours 19 min. Therefore, the true opposition was 0h 39m PM on October 31. Mars\u2019s position was 17\u00b0 31\u2019 40\u201c Taurus. This needs no reduction to the orbit, as it is nearly at the node. The latitude was about 0\u00b0 8\u2019 north. But comparison with the preceding and following days shows a latitude of about 5\u2019 north.\nIX. Let, at any rate, Mars\u2019s position on 1597 December 10 at 8h 30m be 3\u00b0 45\u00bd\u2019 Cancer (as above) ^20. The sun\u2019s position was 29\u00b0 4\u2019 53\u201c Sagittarius. The distance between the stars was 4\u00b0 40\u2019 37\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 61\u2019 20\u201c, that of Mars 23\u2019 40\u201c (for in 1580 the diurnal motion in Gemini was 23\u2019, and in 1582, at 17\u00b0 Cancer, it was 24\u2019). Therefore, the sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 25\u2019 0\u201c. These data show that the time of true opposition followed 3 days 7 hours 14 min. later, on December 14 at 3h 44m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 2\u00b0 27\u2153\u2019 Cancer. The reduction to the orbit (quite ridiculous here, since the observation itself has an uncertainty of several minutes) requires the addition of about 52\u201c. Therefore, the corrected position was 2\u00b0 28\u2019 Cancer. The latitude, from the table, was 3\u00b0 33\u2019 north.\nOn the same night, the one following December 10, at 12\u2159h, Fabricius in East Frisia found Mars\u2019s position to be 3\u00b0 40\u00bc\u2019 Cancer with latitude 3\u00b0 23\u2019 N. In this observation the longitude comes out nearly the same. For the motion over 3h 40m is 3\u00bd\u2019, so that in the Brahean observation too, at 12\u2159h Mars could have been at 3\u00b0 42\u2019 Cancer\u2014two minutes beyond the Fabrician position.\nX. On 1600 January 13\/23 at 11h 40m, the time being adjusted to Uraniborg time, the planet was observed at 10\u00b0 38\u2019 46\u201c Leo ^21. The sun\u2019s position was 3\u00b0 26\u2019 30\u201c Aquarius. The stars were 7\u00b0 12\u2019 16\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion for the next few days was 1\u00b0 1\u2019 3\u201c; that of Mars, 23\u2019 44\u201c. The sum: 1\u00b0 24\u2019 47\u201c. The opposition therefore followed 5 days 2h 22m after; that is, on January 19\/29 at 2h 2m in the morning, before dawn. Mars was at 8\u00b0 38\u2019 Leo. There is no need for reduction, since it is near the limit. The latitude, from the table, was 4\u00b0 30\u2019 50\u201c N.\nXI. On the evening of 1602 Febr. 18\/28 at 10h 30m, using the Tychonic  instruments (with the help of the learned Matthias Seiffard,22 bequeathed us by Tycho), I took the distance of Mars from the middle star of the tail of Ursa Major 23 to be 52\u00b0 22\u2019. And since the distance between Cor Leonis and Procyon was 37\u00b0 22\u2019 20\u201c, which should have been 37\u00b0 19\u2019 50\u201c,24 we know that the sextant reads 2\u00bd minutes high. Therefore, the corrected distance of Mars from the tail of Ursa was 52\u00b0 19\u00bd\u2019. And since the latitude of the fixed star is 56\u00b0 22\u2019, the remainder, by subtraction, is 4\u00b0 2\u00bd\u2019\u2014supposing that Mars was at precisely the same longitude as the fixed star. But because there was a difference of 3\u00be degrees between them (as is clear from the following observations), a slight correction is required.\n For let AB be 3\u00b0 43\u2019 30\u201c on a parallel close to the ecliptic, B Mars, C the fixed star, and BC 52\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c. Dividing the secant of BC by the secant of AB gives the  secant of CA, 52\u00b0 14\u2019, which, subtracted from 56\u00b0 22\u2019 (the latitude of the fixed star) leaves 4\u00b0 8\u2019 north as Mars\u2019s observed latitude. At the same time, we found 19\u00b0 23\u2019 between Mars and Cor Leonis (19\u00b0 20\u00bd corrected), and 21\u00b0 20\u2019 between Mars and the bright star in the wing of Virgo25 (21\u00b0 17\u00bd\u2019 corrected). From these two distances (using the latitudes of the stars and Mars), Mars\u2019s longitude is found to be 13\u00b0 19\u2019 6\u201c Virgo, by consensus of all measurements.\nAlternatively, the meridian altitude of Mars was found at 12h 40m, using two quadrants, to be 50\u00b0 19\u2019, while the tail of Leo26 was 56\u00b0 45\u2019. Therefore, from the declinations and right ascensions of the fixed stars and our distances, Mars\u2019s position is determined as 13\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c Virgo, latitude 4\u00b0 7\u2019 55\u201c ^27. This is the Tychonic procedure. I have included the other for the sake of showing a consensus, and also that it might be evident that despite the lack of absolute perfection in the demonstration, short cuts either in computation or in our understanding can under certain circumstances be applied. For in that previous procedure there is less in the actual work than in the reporting of it. At Prague, 5\u00b0 Scorpio was rising ^28. Therefore, the nonagesimal was about 32\u00bd\u00b0 from the zenith. And since Mars\u2019s distance from the earth was rather more than half the sun\u2019s distance, the resulting parallax of about 5\u2019 opposite 32\u00bd\u00b0 in our parallactic table, shows a latitudinal parallax of 2\u2019 41\u201c. Thus the latitude as seen from the middle of the earth would be 4\u00b0 10\u2154\u2019 north. And because the altitude of the nonagesimal was 57\u00bd\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax at the horizon was 4\u2019 13\u201c. But since Mars was 38\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, the longitudinal parallax corresponding to this position is 2\u2019 36\u201c, and if this be eliminated, Mars would be placed at about 13\u00b0 18\u2019 Virgo ^29. At that moment, the sun\u2019s position was 10\u00b0 16\u2019 42\u201c Pisces. The distance between the bodies was 3\u00b0 1\u2019 18\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 4\u201c, and that of Mars, 24\u2019 5\u201c (for it was 24\u2019 18\u201c at 21\u00b0 Leo in 1585, and 24\u2019 at 26 Virgo in 1587). The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 24\u2019 9\u201c. The true opposition therefore followed 2 days 3 hours 43 minutes later, on 21 February\/3 March before dawn at 2h 13m, Mars being at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 35\u201c Virgo. Forty seconds must be subtracted to reduce the position to the orbit, putting Mars at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 Virgo, with slightly less latitude than before, since the latitude was then decreasing. It was therefore about 4\u00b0 10\u2019, or 4\u00b0 7\u2153\u2019 if the parallax be neglected.\n But because, since Tycho\u2019s death, we have not made frequent observations nor continued them over several days, it would be best, for certainty\u2019s sake, also to make use of those observations which David Fabricius of East Frisia, a sedulous practitioner of astronomy, has communicated to me.\nOn February 16, old style, at 5h in the morning, he took the planet\u2019s distances from the tail of Leo (for the latitude), from the neck of Leo,30 and, on the other hand, from the bright star in the southern wing of Virgo, so as to check its longitude by working it out twice.\nI could make use of Tycho\u2019s line of reasoning, which he routinely adopted in volume I of the Progymnasmata when (as here) the declination of the planet was not known. But because that method extends to ten operations, I prefer for the sake of brevity to proceed as I did before with my own observations. Here there are no hidden dangers.\nFirst, the star in the wing of Virgo, adjusted to our time, is at 4\u00b0 36\u2019 30\u201c Libra with latitude 2\u00b0 50\u2019 north. Fabricius found that Mars is 20\u00b0 18\u2019 westward from it on the zodiac, which puts Mars at about 14\u00b0 18\u2019 30\u201c Virgo. This is a preliminary, approximate figure: the longitude will shortly be corrected. Now the tail of Leo31 is at 16\u00b0 4\u2019 Virgo, with latitude 12\u00b0 18\u2019 North, and Mars was found to be 8\u00b0 17\u2019 distant from the Tail. What is sought is the distance of its parallel from the Tail, since the difference in longitude is 1\u00b0 45\u2019. Dividing the secant of 8\u00b0 17\u2019 by the secant of 1\u00b0 45\u2019 gives the secant of 8\u00b0 6\u2019, the arc sought. This subtracted from the fixed star\u2019s northern latitude of 12\u00b0 18\u2019 leaves Mars\u2019s latitude, 4\u00b0 12\u2019 north. This I now take as determined, and compare it with the latitudes of the fixed stars according to the laws of trigonometry. From the Wing of Virgo, I find Mars\u2019s longitude to be 14\u00b0 19\u2019 Virgo; from the Neck of Leo, 14\u00b0 23\u2019 36\u201c. The mean of these two is 14\u00b0 21\u2019 18\u201c Virgo. And since the sextant gave distances larger than the truth, the latitude would come out at 4\u00b0 14\u2019 north.\nOn the night following February 23, at 12h, he observed Mars in relation to five fixed stars: the Tail of Leo and Arcturus for latitude, and for the longitude, in the first instance, Spica (which followed it), and, in the second, the Neck of Leo and Cor Leonis (which preceded it).\nBy a rough estimate, I foresee that Mars is going to fall at 11\u00bc\u00b0 Virgo. It was found to be 9\u00b0 24\u2019 from the Tail of Leo, and hence, its latitude comes out at 4\u00b0 6\u2019 ^32. And now, through this and the latitudes of the fixed stars, together with their distances (17\u00b0 26\u2019 from Regulus, 17\u00b0 51\u2019 from the Neck of Leo, 37\u00b0 28\u2019 from Spica, 44\u00b0 15\u2019 from Arcturus), Mars\u2019s position comes out at 11\u00b0 21\u2019 23\u201c Virgo (from Regulus), 11\u00b0 20\u2019 52\u201c Virgo (from the Neck of Leo), and 11\u00b0 17\u2019 40\u201c (from Spica). Again (as you see) the distances err in being too great. For from the Heart and the Neck [of Leo], Mars is pushed a little eastward, and from Spica and Arcturus a little westward, and more from Arcturus, owing to its greater northern latitude ^33. The mean (ignoring Arcturus), 11\u00b0 19\u2019 20\u201c Virgo, is very nearly true. Also, the latitude is greater, namely, 4\u00b0 7\u2019 40\u201c north. Now from February 15 at 17h to 23 February at 12h, a period of 7 days 19 hours, Mars moved 3\u00b0 0\u2019: 180 minutes in 187 hours. That is, about one minute per hour. And if you wish to take it into account, the parallax (if any) is subtracted from the longitude on February 16 and a little is added on February 23.\n Because the last observation follows the time of observation found by me by 2 days 21 hours 47 min., add the motion corresponding to this time, 1\u00b0 7\u2019: the position will come out 12\u00b0 26\u2019 Virgo. The agreement is thus very good\u2014it could not be better\u2014given that both of us [that is, Kepler and Fabricius] work independently and do not rely on the facilities used by Tycho Brahe.","1677":"VIII. On 1595 October 30 at 8h 20m, the planet was found at 17\u00b0 47\u2019 15\u201c Taurus,19 not far from the nonagesimal. We may thus be sure of the parallax, although we must take it into account. The latitude was 0\u00b0 5\u2019 10\u201c north. The sun\u2019s position was 16\u00b0 50\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio. The distance between the stars was 56\u2019 45\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 35\u201c; that of Mars, 22\u2019 54\u201c, as appears by comparing the nearby observations. The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 23\u2019 29\u201c. If the distance between the stars be divided by this, it comes out to 40\u2019 47\u201c of a day, or 16 hours 19 min. Therefore, the true opposition was 0h 39m PM on October 31. Mars\u2019s position was 17\u00b0 31\u2019 40\u201c Taurus. This needs no reduction to the orbit, as it is nearly at the node. The latitude was about 0\u00b0 8\u2019 north. But comparison with the preceding and following days shows a latitude of about 5\u2019 north.\nIX. Let, at any rate, Mars\u2019s position on 1597 December 10 at 8h 30m be 3\u00b0 45\u00bd\u2019 Cancer (as above) ^20. The sun\u2019s position was 29\u00b0 4\u2019 53\u201c Sagittarius. The distance between the stars was 4\u00b0 40\u2019 37\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 61\u2019 20\u201c, that of Mars 23\u2019 40\u201c (for in 1580 the diurnal motion in Gemini was 23\u2019, and in 1582, at 17\u00b0 Cancer, it was 24\u2019). Therefore, the sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 25\u2019 0\u201c. These data show that the time of true opposition followed 3 days 7 hours 14 min. later, on December 14 at 3h 44m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 2\u00b0 27\u2153\u2019 Cancer. The reduction to the orbit (quite ridiculous here, since the observation itself has an uncertainty of several minutes) requires the addition of about 52\u201c. Therefore, the corrected position was 2\u00b0 28\u2019 Cancer. The latitude, from the table, was 3\u00b0 33\u2019 north.\nOn the same night, the one following December 10, at 12\u2159h, Fabricius in East Frisia found Mars\u2019s position to be 3\u00b0 40\u00bc\u2019 Cancer with latitude 3\u00b0 23\u2019 N. In this observation the longitude comes out nearly the same. For the motion over 3h 40m is 3\u00bd\u2019, so that in the Brahean observation too, at 12\u2159h Mars could have been at 3\u00b0 42\u2019 Cancer\u2014two minutes beyond the Fabrician position.\nX. On 1600 January 13\/23 at 11h 40m, the time being adjusted to Uraniborg time, the planet was observed at 10\u00b0 38\u2019 46\u201c Leo ^21. The sun\u2019s position was 3\u00b0 26\u2019 30\u201c Aquarius. The stars were 7\u00b0 12\u2019 16\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion for the next few days was 1\u00b0 1\u2019 3\u201c; that of Mars, 23\u2019 44\u201c. The sum: 1\u00b0 24\u2019 47\u201c. The opposition therefore followed 5 days 2h 22m after; that is, on January 19\/29 at 2h 2m in the morning, before dawn. Mars was at 8\u00b0 38\u2019 Leo. There is no need for reduction, since it is near the limit. The latitude, from the table, was 4\u00b0 30\u2019 50\u201c N.\nXI. On the evening of 1602 Febr. 18\/28 at 10h 30m, using the Tychonic  instruments (with the help of the learned Matthias Seiffard,22 bequeathed us by Tycho), I took the distance of Mars from the middle star of the tail of Ursa Major 23 to be 52\u00b0 22\u2019. And since the distance between Cor Leonis and Procyon was 37\u00b0 22\u2019 20\u201c, which should have been 37\u00b0 19\u2019 50\u201c,24 we know that the sextant reads 2\u00bd minutes high. Therefore, the corrected distance of Mars from the tail of Ursa was 52\u00b0 19\u00bd\u2019. And since the latitude of the fixed star is 56\u00b0 22\u2019, the remainder, by subtraction, is 4\u00b0 2\u00bd\u2019\u2014supposing that Mars was at precisely the same longitude as the fixed star. But because there was a difference of 3\u00be degrees between them (as is clear from the following observations), a slight correction is required.\n For let AB be 3\u00b0 43\u2019 30\u201c on a parallel close to the ecliptic, B Mars, C the fixed star, and BC 52\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c. Dividing the secant of BC by the secant of AB gives the  secant of CA, 52\u00b0 14\u2019, which, subtracted from 56\u00b0 22\u2019 (the latitude of the fixed star) leaves 4\u00b0 8\u2019 north as Mars\u2019s observed latitude. At the same time, we found 19\u00b0 23\u2019 between Mars and Cor Leonis (19\u00b0 20\u00bd corrected), and 21\u00b0 20\u2019 between Mars and the bright star in the wing of Virgo25 (21\u00b0 17\u00bd\u2019 corrected). From these two distances (using the latitudes of the stars and Mars), Mars\u2019s longitude is found to be 13\u00b0 19\u2019 6\u201c Virgo, by consensus of all measurements.\nAlternatively, the meridian altitude of Mars was found at 12h 40m, using two quadrants, to be 50\u00b0 19\u2019, while the tail of Leo26 was 56\u00b0 45\u2019. Therefore, from the declinations and right ascensions of the fixed stars and our distances, Mars\u2019s position is determined as 13\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c Virgo, latitude 4\u00b0 7\u2019 55\u201c ^27. This is the Tychonic procedure. I have included the other for the sake of showing a consensus, and also that it might be evident that despite the lack of absolute perfection in the demonstration, short cuts either in computation or in our understanding can under certain circumstances be applied. For in that previous procedure there is less in the actual work than in the reporting of it. At Prague, 5\u00b0 Scorpio was rising ^28. Therefore, the nonagesimal was about 32\u00bd\u00b0 from the zenith. And since Mars\u2019s distance from the earth was rather more than half the sun\u2019s distance, the resulting parallax of about 5\u2019 opposite 32\u00bd\u00b0 in our parallactic table, shows a latitudinal parallax of 2\u2019 41\u201c. Thus the latitude as seen from the middle of the earth would be 4\u00b0 10\u2154\u2019 north. And because the altitude of the nonagesimal was 57\u00bd\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax at the horizon was 4\u2019 13\u201c. But since Mars was 38\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, the longitudinal parallax corresponding to this position is 2\u2019 36\u201c, and if this be eliminated, Mars would be placed at about 13\u00b0 18\u2019 Virgo ^29. At that moment, the sun\u2019s position was 10\u00b0 16\u2019 42\u201c Pisces. The distance between the bodies was 3\u00b0 1\u2019 18\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 4\u201c, and that of Mars, 24\u2019 5\u201c (for it was 24\u2019 18\u201c at 21\u00b0 Leo in 1585, and 24\u2019 at 26 Virgo in 1587). The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 24\u2019 9\u201c. The true opposition therefore followed 2 days 3 hours 43 minutes later, on 21 February\/3 March before dawn at 2h 13m, Mars being at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 35\u201c Virgo. Forty seconds must be subtracted to reduce the position to the orbit, putting Mars at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 Virgo, with slightly less latitude than before, since the latitude was then decreasing. It was therefore about 4\u00b0 10\u2019, or 4\u00b0 7\u2153\u2019 if the parallax be neglected.\n But because, since Tycho\u2019s death, we have not made frequent observations nor continued them over several days, it would be best, for certainty\u2019s sake, also to make use of those observations which David Fabricius of East Frisia, a sedulous practitioner of astronomy, has communicated to me.\nOn February 16, old style, at 5h in the morning, he took the planet\u2019s distances from the tail of Leo (for the latitude), from the neck of Leo,30 and, on the other hand, from the bright star in the southern wing of Virgo, so as to check its longitude by working it out twice.\nI could make use of Tycho\u2019s line of reasoning, which he routinely adopted in volume I of the Progymnasmata when (as here) the declination of the planet was not known. But because that method extends to ten operations, I prefer for the sake of brevity to proceed as I did before with my own observations. Here there are no hidden dangers.\nFirst, the star in the wing of Virgo, adjusted to our time, is at 4\u00b0 36\u2019 30\u201c Libra with latitude 2\u00b0 50\u2019 north. Fabricius found that Mars is 20\u00b0 18\u2019 westward from it on the zodiac, which puts Mars at about 14\u00b0 18\u2019 30\u201c Virgo. This is a preliminary, approximate figure: the longitude will shortly be corrected. Now the tail of Leo31 is at 16\u00b0 4\u2019 Virgo, with latitude 12\u00b0 18\u2019 North, and Mars was found to be 8\u00b0 17\u2019 distant from the Tail. What is sought is the distance of its parallel from the Tail, since the difference in longitude is 1\u00b0 45\u2019. Dividing the secant of 8\u00b0 17\u2019 by the secant of 1\u00b0 45\u2019 gives the secant of 8\u00b0 6\u2019, the arc sought. This subtracted from the fixed star\u2019s northern latitude of 12\u00b0 18\u2019 leaves Mars\u2019s latitude, 4\u00b0 12\u2019 north. This I now take as determined, and compare it with the latitudes of the fixed stars according to the laws of trigonometry. From the Wing of Virgo, I find Mars\u2019s longitude to be 14\u00b0 19\u2019 Virgo; from the Neck of Leo, 14\u00b0 23\u2019 36\u201c. The mean of these two is 14\u00b0 21\u2019 18\u201c Virgo. And since the sextant gave distances larger than the truth, the latitude would come out at 4\u00b0 14\u2019 north.\nOn the night following February 23, at 12h, he observed Mars in relation to five fixed stars: the Tail of Leo and Arcturus for latitude, and for the longitude, in the first instance, Spica (which followed it), and, in the second, the Neck of Leo and Cor Leonis (which preceded it).\nBy a rough estimate, I foresee that Mars is going to fall at 11\u00bc\u00b0 Virgo. It was found to be 9\u00b0 24\u2019 from the Tail of Leo, and hence, its latitude comes out at 4\u00b0 6\u2019 ^32. And now, through this and the latitudes of the fixed stars, together with their distances (17\u00b0 26\u2019 from Regulus, 17\u00b0 51\u2019 from the Neck of Leo, 37\u00b0 28\u2019 from Spica, 44\u00b0 15\u2019 from Arcturus), Mars\u2019s position comes out at 11\u00b0 21\u2019 23\u201c Virgo (from Regulus), 11\u00b0 20\u2019 52\u201c Virgo (from the Neck of Leo), and 11\u00b0 17\u2019 40\u201c (from Spica). Again (as you see) the distances err in being too great. For from the Heart and the Neck [of Leo], Mars is pushed a little eastward, and from Spica and Arcturus a little westward, and more from Arcturus, owing to its greater northern latitude ^33. The mean (ignoring Arcturus), 11\u00b0 19\u2019 20\u201c Virgo, is very nearly true. Also, the latitude is greater, namely, 4\u00b0 7\u2019 40\u201c north. Now from February 15 at 17h to 23 February at 12h, a period of 7 days 19 hours, Mars moved 3\u00b0 0\u2019: 180 minutes in 187 hours. That is, about one minute per hour. And if you wish to take it into account, the parallax (if any) is subtracted from the longitude on February 16 and a little is added on February 23.\n Because the last observation follows the time of observation found by me by 2 days 21 hours 47 min., add the motion corresponding to this time, 1\u00b0 7\u2019: the position will come out 12\u00b0 26\u2019 Virgo. The agreement is thus very good\u2014it could not be better\u2014given that both of us [that is, Kepler and Fabricius] work independently and do not rely on the facilities used by Tycho Brahe.","1678":"VIII. On 1595 October 30 at 8h 20m, the planet was found at 17\u00b0 47\u2019 15\u201c Taurus,19 not far from the nonagesimal. We may thus be sure of the parallax, although we must take it into account. The latitude was 0\u00b0 5\u2019 10\u201c north. The sun\u2019s position was 16\u00b0 50\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio. The distance between the stars was 56\u2019 45\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 35\u201c; that of Mars, 22\u2019 54\u201c, as appears by comparing the nearby observations. The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 23\u2019 29\u201c. If the distance between the stars be divided by this, it comes out to 40\u2019 47\u201c of a day, or 16 hours 19 min. Therefore, the true opposition was 0h 39m PM on October 31. Mars\u2019s position was 17\u00b0 31\u2019 40\u201c Taurus. This needs no reduction to the orbit, as it is nearly at the node. The latitude was about 0\u00b0 8\u2019 north. But comparison with the preceding and following days shows a latitude of about 5\u2019 north.\nIX. Let, at any rate, Mars\u2019s position on 1597 December 10 at 8h 30m be 3\u00b0 45\u00bd\u2019 Cancer (as above) ^20. The sun\u2019s position was 29\u00b0 4\u2019 53\u201c Sagittarius. The distance between the stars was 4\u00b0 40\u2019 37\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 61\u2019 20\u201c, that of Mars 23\u2019 40\u201c (for in 1580 the diurnal motion in Gemini was 23\u2019, and in 1582, at 17\u00b0 Cancer, it was 24\u2019). Therefore, the sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 25\u2019 0\u201c. These data show that the time of true opposition followed 3 days 7 hours 14 min. later, on December 14 at 3h 44m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 2\u00b0 27\u2153\u2019 Cancer. The reduction to the orbit (quite ridiculous here, since the observation itself has an uncertainty of several minutes) requires the addition of about 52\u201c. Therefore, the corrected position was 2\u00b0 28\u2019 Cancer. The latitude, from the table, was 3\u00b0 33\u2019 north.\nOn the same night, the one following December 10, at 12\u2159h, Fabricius in East Frisia found Mars\u2019s position to be 3\u00b0 40\u00bc\u2019 Cancer with latitude 3\u00b0 23\u2019 N. In this observation the longitude comes out nearly the same. For the motion over 3h 40m is 3\u00bd\u2019, so that in the Brahean observation too, at 12\u2159h Mars could have been at 3\u00b0 42\u2019 Cancer\u2014two minutes beyond the Fabrician position.\nX. On 1600 January 13\/23 at 11h 40m, the time being adjusted to Uraniborg time, the planet was observed at 10\u00b0 38\u2019 46\u201c Leo ^21. The sun\u2019s position was 3\u00b0 26\u2019 30\u201c Aquarius. The stars were 7\u00b0 12\u2019 16\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion for the next few days was 1\u00b0 1\u2019 3\u201c; that of Mars, 23\u2019 44\u201c. The sum: 1\u00b0 24\u2019 47\u201c. The opposition therefore followed 5 days 2h 22m after; that is, on January 19\/29 at 2h 2m in the morning, before dawn. Mars was at 8\u00b0 38\u2019 Leo. There is no need for reduction, since it is near the limit. The latitude, from the table, was 4\u00b0 30\u2019 50\u201c N.\nXI. On the evening of 1602 Febr. 18\/28 at 10h 30m, using the Tychonic  instruments (with the help of the learned Matthias Seiffard,22 bequeathed us by Tycho), I took the distance of Mars from the middle star of the tail of Ursa Major 23 to be 52\u00b0 22\u2019. And since the distance between Cor Leonis and Procyon was 37\u00b0 22\u2019 20\u201c, which should have been 37\u00b0 19\u2019 50\u201c,24 we know that the sextant reads 2\u00bd minutes high. Therefore, the corrected distance of Mars from the tail of Ursa was 52\u00b0 19\u00bd\u2019. And since the latitude of the fixed star is 56\u00b0 22\u2019, the remainder, by subtraction, is 4\u00b0 2\u00bd\u2019\u2014supposing that Mars was at precisely the same longitude as the fixed star. But because there was a difference of 3\u00be degrees between them (as is clear from the following observations), a slight correction is required.\n For let AB be 3\u00b0 43\u2019 30\u201c on a parallel close to the ecliptic, B Mars, C the fixed star, and BC 52\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c. Dividing the secant of BC by the secant of AB gives the  secant of CA, 52\u00b0 14\u2019, which, subtracted from 56\u00b0 22\u2019 (the latitude of the fixed star) leaves 4\u00b0 8\u2019 north as Mars\u2019s observed latitude. At the same time, we found 19\u00b0 23\u2019 between Mars and Cor Leonis (19\u00b0 20\u00bd corrected), and 21\u00b0 20\u2019 between Mars and the bright star in the wing of Virgo25 (21\u00b0 17\u00bd\u2019 corrected). From these two distances (using the latitudes of the stars and Mars), Mars\u2019s longitude is found to be 13\u00b0 19\u2019 6\u201c Virgo, by consensus of all measurements.\nAlternatively, the meridian altitude of Mars was found at 12h 40m, using two quadrants, to be 50\u00b0 19\u2019, while the tail of Leo26 was 56\u00b0 45\u2019. Therefore, from the declinations and right ascensions of the fixed stars and our distances, Mars\u2019s position is determined as 13\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c Virgo, latitude 4\u00b0 7\u2019 55\u201c ^27. This is the Tychonic procedure. I have included the other for the sake of showing a consensus, and also that it might be evident that despite the lack of absolute perfection in the demonstration, short cuts either in computation or in our understanding can under certain circumstances be applied. For in that previous procedure there is less in the actual work than in the reporting of it. At Prague, 5\u00b0 Scorpio was rising ^28. Therefore, the nonagesimal was about 32\u00bd\u00b0 from the zenith. And since Mars\u2019s distance from the earth was rather more than half the sun\u2019s distance, the resulting parallax of about 5\u2019 opposite 32\u00bd\u00b0 in our parallactic table, shows a latitudinal parallax of 2\u2019 41\u201c. Thus the latitude as seen from the middle of the earth would be 4\u00b0 10\u2154\u2019 north. And because the altitude of the nonagesimal was 57\u00bd\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax at the horizon was 4\u2019 13\u201c. But since Mars was 38\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, the longitudinal parallax corresponding to this position is 2\u2019 36\u201c, and if this be eliminated, Mars would be placed at about 13\u00b0 18\u2019 Virgo ^29. At that moment, the sun\u2019s position was 10\u00b0 16\u2019 42\u201c Pisces. The distance between the bodies was 3\u00b0 1\u2019 18\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 4\u201c, and that of Mars, 24\u2019 5\u201c (for it was 24\u2019 18\u201c at 21\u00b0 Leo in 1585, and 24\u2019 at 26 Virgo in 1587). The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 24\u2019 9\u201c. The true opposition therefore followed 2 days 3 hours 43 minutes later, on 21 February\/3 March before dawn at 2h 13m, Mars being at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 35\u201c Virgo. Forty seconds must be subtracted to reduce the position to the orbit, putting Mars at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 Virgo, with slightly less latitude than before, since the latitude was then decreasing. It was therefore about 4\u00b0 10\u2019, or 4\u00b0 7\u2153\u2019 if the parallax be neglected.\n But because, since Tycho\u2019s death, we have not made frequent observations nor continued them over several days, it would be best, for certainty\u2019s sake, also to make use of those observations which David Fabricius of East Frisia, a sedulous practitioner of astronomy, has communicated to me.\nOn February 16, old style, at 5h in the morning, he took the planet\u2019s distances from the tail of Leo (for the latitude), from the neck of Leo,30 and, on the other hand, from the bright star in the southern wing of Virgo, so as to check its longitude by working it out twice.\nI could make use of Tycho\u2019s line of reasoning, which he routinely adopted in volume I of the Progymnasmata when (as here) the declination of the planet was not known. But because that method extends to ten operations, I prefer for the sake of brevity to proceed as I did before with my own observations. Here there are no hidden dangers.\nFirst, the star in the wing of Virgo, adjusted to our time, is at 4\u00b0 36\u2019 30\u201c Libra with latitude 2\u00b0 50\u2019 north. Fabricius found that Mars is 20\u00b0 18\u2019 westward from it on the zodiac, which puts Mars at about 14\u00b0 18\u2019 30\u201c Virgo. This is a preliminary, approximate figure: the longitude will shortly be corrected. Now the tail of Leo31 is at 16\u00b0 4\u2019 Virgo, with latitude 12\u00b0 18\u2019 North, and Mars was found to be 8\u00b0 17\u2019 distant from the Tail. What is sought is the distance of its parallel from the Tail, since the difference in longitude is 1\u00b0 45\u2019. Dividing the secant of 8\u00b0 17\u2019 by the secant of 1\u00b0 45\u2019 gives the secant of 8\u00b0 6\u2019, the arc sought. This subtracted from the fixed star\u2019s northern latitude of 12\u00b0 18\u2019 leaves Mars\u2019s latitude, 4\u00b0 12\u2019 north. This I now take as determined, and compare it with the latitudes of the fixed stars according to the laws of trigonometry. From the Wing of Virgo, I find Mars\u2019s longitude to be 14\u00b0 19\u2019 Virgo; from the Neck of Leo, 14\u00b0 23\u2019 36\u201c. The mean of these two is 14\u00b0 21\u2019 18\u201c Virgo. And since the sextant gave distances larger than the truth, the latitude would come out at 4\u00b0 14\u2019 north.\nOn the night following February 23, at 12h, he observed Mars in relation to five fixed stars: the Tail of Leo and Arcturus for latitude, and for the longitude, in the first instance, Spica (which followed it), and, in the second, the Neck of Leo and Cor Leonis (which preceded it).\nBy a rough estimate, I foresee that Mars is going to fall at 11\u00bc\u00b0 Virgo. It was found to be 9\u00b0 24\u2019 from the Tail of Leo, and hence, its latitude comes out at 4\u00b0 6\u2019 ^32. And now, through this and the latitudes of the fixed stars, together with their distances (17\u00b0 26\u2019 from Regulus, 17\u00b0 51\u2019 from the Neck of Leo, 37\u00b0 28\u2019 from Spica, 44\u00b0 15\u2019 from Arcturus), Mars\u2019s position comes out at 11\u00b0 21\u2019 23\u201c Virgo (from Regulus), 11\u00b0 20\u2019 52\u201c Virgo (from the Neck of Leo), and 11\u00b0 17\u2019 40\u201c (from Spica). Again (as you see) the distances err in being too great. For from the Heart and the Neck [of Leo], Mars is pushed a little eastward, and from Spica and Arcturus a little westward, and more from Arcturus, owing to its greater northern latitude ^33. The mean (ignoring Arcturus), 11\u00b0 19\u2019 20\u201c Virgo, is very nearly true. Also, the latitude is greater, namely, 4\u00b0 7\u2019 40\u201c north. Now from February 15 at 17h to 23 February at 12h, a period of 7 days 19 hours, Mars moved 3\u00b0 0\u2019: 180 minutes in 187 hours. That is, about one minute per hour. And if you wish to take it into account, the parallax (if any) is subtracted from the longitude on February 16 and a little is added on February 23.\n Because the last observation follows the time of observation found by me by 2 days 21 hours 47 min., add the motion corresponding to this time, 1\u00b0 7\u2019: the position will come out 12\u00b0 26\u2019 Virgo. The agreement is thus very good\u2014it could not be better\u2014given that both of us [that is, Kepler and Fabricius] work independently and do not rely on the facilities used by Tycho Brahe.","1679":"VIII. On 1595 October 30 at 8h 20m, the planet was found at 17\u00b0 47\u2019 15\u201c Taurus,19 not far from the nonagesimal. We may thus be sure of the parallax, although we must take it into account. The latitude was 0\u00b0 5\u2019 10\u201c north. The sun\u2019s position was 16\u00b0 50\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio. The distance between the stars was 56\u2019 45\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 35\u201c; that of Mars, 22\u2019 54\u201c, as appears by comparing the nearby observations. The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 23\u2019 29\u201c. If the distance between the stars be divided by this, it comes out to 40\u2019 47\u201c of a day, or 16 hours 19 min. Therefore, the true opposition was 0h 39m PM on October 31. Mars\u2019s position was 17\u00b0 31\u2019 40\u201c Taurus. This needs no reduction to the orbit, as it is nearly at the node. The latitude was about 0\u00b0 8\u2019 north. But comparison with the preceding and following days shows a latitude of about 5\u2019 north.\nIX. Let, at any rate, Mars\u2019s position on 1597 December 10 at 8h 30m be 3\u00b0 45\u00bd\u2019 Cancer (as above) ^20. The sun\u2019s position was 29\u00b0 4\u2019 53\u201c Sagittarius. The distance between the stars was 4\u00b0 40\u2019 37\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 61\u2019 20\u201c, that of Mars 23\u2019 40\u201c (for in 1580 the diurnal motion in Gemini was 23\u2019, and in 1582, at 17\u00b0 Cancer, it was 24\u2019). Therefore, the sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 25\u2019 0\u201c. These data show that the time of true opposition followed 3 days 7 hours 14 min. later, on December 14 at 3h 44m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 2\u00b0 27\u2153\u2019 Cancer. The reduction to the orbit (quite ridiculous here, since the observation itself has an uncertainty of several minutes) requires the addition of about 52\u201c. Therefore, the corrected position was 2\u00b0 28\u2019 Cancer. The latitude, from the table, was 3\u00b0 33\u2019 north.\nOn the same night, the one following December 10, at 12\u2159h, Fabricius in East Frisia found Mars\u2019s position to be 3\u00b0 40\u00bc\u2019 Cancer with latitude 3\u00b0 23\u2019 N. In this observation the longitude comes out nearly the same. For the motion over 3h 40m is 3\u00bd\u2019, so that in the Brahean observation too, at 12\u2159h Mars could have been at 3\u00b0 42\u2019 Cancer\u2014two minutes beyond the Fabrician position.\nX. On 1600 January 13\/23 at 11h 40m, the time being adjusted to Uraniborg time, the planet was observed at 10\u00b0 38\u2019 46\u201c Leo ^21. The sun\u2019s position was 3\u00b0 26\u2019 30\u201c Aquarius. The stars were 7\u00b0 12\u2019 16\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion for the next few days was 1\u00b0 1\u2019 3\u201c; that of Mars, 23\u2019 44\u201c. The sum: 1\u00b0 24\u2019 47\u201c. The opposition therefore followed 5 days 2h 22m after; that is, on January 19\/29 at 2h 2m in the morning, before dawn. Mars was at 8\u00b0 38\u2019 Leo. There is no need for reduction, since it is near the limit. The latitude, from the table, was 4\u00b0 30\u2019 50\u201c N.\nXI. On the evening of 1602 Febr. 18\/28 at 10h 30m, using the Tychonic  instruments (with the help of the learned Matthias Seiffard,22 bequeathed us by Tycho), I took the distance of Mars from the middle star of the tail of Ursa Major 23 to be 52\u00b0 22\u2019. And since the distance between Cor Leonis and Procyon was 37\u00b0 22\u2019 20\u201c, which should have been 37\u00b0 19\u2019 50\u201c,24 we know that the sextant reads 2\u00bd minutes high. Therefore, the corrected distance of Mars from the tail of Ursa was 52\u00b0 19\u00bd\u2019. And since the latitude of the fixed star is 56\u00b0 22\u2019, the remainder, by subtraction, is 4\u00b0 2\u00bd\u2019\u2014supposing that Mars was at precisely the same longitude as the fixed star. But because there was a difference of 3\u00be degrees between them (as is clear from the following observations), a slight correction is required.\n For let AB be 3\u00b0 43\u2019 30\u201c on a parallel close to the ecliptic, B Mars, C the fixed star, and BC 52\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c. Dividing the secant of BC by the secant of AB gives the  secant of CA, 52\u00b0 14\u2019, which, subtracted from 56\u00b0 22\u2019 (the latitude of the fixed star) leaves 4\u00b0 8\u2019 north as Mars\u2019s observed latitude. At the same time, we found 19\u00b0 23\u2019 between Mars and Cor Leonis (19\u00b0 20\u00bd corrected), and 21\u00b0 20\u2019 between Mars and the bright star in the wing of Virgo25 (21\u00b0 17\u00bd\u2019 corrected). From these two distances (using the latitudes of the stars and Mars), Mars\u2019s longitude is found to be 13\u00b0 19\u2019 6\u201c Virgo, by consensus of all measurements.\nAlternatively, the meridian altitude of Mars was found at 12h 40m, using two quadrants, to be 50\u00b0 19\u2019, while the tail of Leo26 was 56\u00b0 45\u2019. Therefore, from the declinations and right ascensions of the fixed stars and our distances, Mars\u2019s position is determined as 13\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c Virgo, latitude 4\u00b0 7\u2019 55\u201c ^27. This is the Tychonic procedure. I have included the other for the sake of showing a consensus, and also that it might be evident that despite the lack of absolute perfection in the demonstration, short cuts either in computation or in our understanding can under certain circumstances be applied. For in that previous procedure there is less in the actual work than in the reporting of it. At Prague, 5\u00b0 Scorpio was rising ^28. Therefore, the nonagesimal was about 32\u00bd\u00b0 from the zenith. And since Mars\u2019s distance from the earth was rather more than half the sun\u2019s distance, the resulting parallax of about 5\u2019 opposite 32\u00bd\u00b0 in our parallactic table, shows a latitudinal parallax of 2\u2019 41\u201c. Thus the latitude as seen from the middle of the earth would be 4\u00b0 10\u2154\u2019 north. And because the altitude of the nonagesimal was 57\u00bd\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax at the horizon was 4\u2019 13\u201c. But since Mars was 38\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, the longitudinal parallax corresponding to this position is 2\u2019 36\u201c, and if this be eliminated, Mars would be placed at about 13\u00b0 18\u2019 Virgo ^29. At that moment, the sun\u2019s position was 10\u00b0 16\u2019 42\u201c Pisces. The distance between the bodies was 3\u00b0 1\u2019 18\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 4\u201c, and that of Mars, 24\u2019 5\u201c (for it was 24\u2019 18\u201c at 21\u00b0 Leo in 1585, and 24\u2019 at 26 Virgo in 1587). The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 24\u2019 9\u201c. The true opposition therefore followed 2 days 3 hours 43 minutes later, on 21 February\/3 March before dawn at 2h 13m, Mars being at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 35\u201c Virgo. Forty seconds must be subtracted to reduce the position to the orbit, putting Mars at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 Virgo, with slightly less latitude than before, since the latitude was then decreasing. It was therefore about 4\u00b0 10\u2019, or 4\u00b0 7\u2153\u2019 if the parallax be neglected.\n But because, since Tycho\u2019s death, we have not made frequent observations nor continued them over several days, it would be best, for certainty\u2019s sake, also to make use of those observations which David Fabricius of East Frisia, a sedulous practitioner of astronomy, has communicated to me.\nOn February 16, old style, at 5h in the morning, he took the planet\u2019s distances from the tail of Leo (for the latitude), from the neck of Leo,30 and, on the other hand, from the bright star in the southern wing of Virgo, so as to check its longitude by working it out twice.\nI could make use of Tycho\u2019s line of reasoning, which he routinely adopted in volume I of the Progymnasmata when (as here) the declination of the planet was not known. But because that method extends to ten operations, I prefer for the sake of brevity to proceed as I did before with my own observations. Here there are no hidden dangers.\nFirst, the star in the wing of Virgo, adjusted to our time, is at 4\u00b0 36\u2019 30\u201c Libra with latitude 2\u00b0 50\u2019 north. Fabricius found that Mars is 20\u00b0 18\u2019 westward from it on the zodiac, which puts Mars at about 14\u00b0 18\u2019 30\u201c Virgo. This is a preliminary, approximate figure: the longitude will shortly be corrected. Now the tail of Leo31 is at 16\u00b0 4\u2019 Virgo, with latitude 12\u00b0 18\u2019 North, and Mars was found to be 8\u00b0 17\u2019 distant from the Tail. What is sought is the distance of its parallel from the Tail, since the difference in longitude is 1\u00b0 45\u2019. Dividing the secant of 8\u00b0 17\u2019 by the secant of 1\u00b0 45\u2019 gives the secant of 8\u00b0 6\u2019, the arc sought. This subtracted from the fixed star\u2019s northern latitude of 12\u00b0 18\u2019 leaves Mars\u2019s latitude, 4\u00b0 12\u2019 north. This I now take as determined, and compare it with the latitudes of the fixed stars according to the laws of trigonometry. From the Wing of Virgo, I find Mars\u2019s longitude to be 14\u00b0 19\u2019 Virgo; from the Neck of Leo, 14\u00b0 23\u2019 36\u201c. The mean of these two is 14\u00b0 21\u2019 18\u201c Virgo. And since the sextant gave distances larger than the truth, the latitude would come out at 4\u00b0 14\u2019 north.\nOn the night following February 23, at 12h, he observed Mars in relation to five fixed stars: the Tail of Leo and Arcturus for latitude, and for the longitude, in the first instance, Spica (which followed it), and, in the second, the Neck of Leo and Cor Leonis (which preceded it).\nBy a rough estimate, I foresee that Mars is going to fall at 11\u00bc\u00b0 Virgo. It was found to be 9\u00b0 24\u2019 from the Tail of Leo, and hence, its latitude comes out at 4\u00b0 6\u2019 ^32. And now, through this and the latitudes of the fixed stars, together with their distances (17\u00b0 26\u2019 from Regulus, 17\u00b0 51\u2019 from the Neck of Leo, 37\u00b0 28\u2019 from Spica, 44\u00b0 15\u2019 from Arcturus), Mars\u2019s position comes out at 11\u00b0 21\u2019 23\u201c Virgo (from Regulus), 11\u00b0 20\u2019 52\u201c Virgo (from the Neck of Leo), and 11\u00b0 17\u2019 40\u201c (from Spica). Again (as you see) the distances err in being too great. For from the Heart and the Neck [of Leo], Mars is pushed a little eastward, and from Spica and Arcturus a little westward, and more from Arcturus, owing to its greater northern latitude ^33. The mean (ignoring Arcturus), 11\u00b0 19\u2019 20\u201c Virgo, is very nearly true. Also, the latitude is greater, namely, 4\u00b0 7\u2019 40\u201c north. Now from February 15 at 17h to 23 February at 12h, a period of 7 days 19 hours, Mars moved 3\u00b0 0\u2019: 180 minutes in 187 hours. That is, about one minute per hour. And if you wish to take it into account, the parallax (if any) is subtracted from the longitude on February 16 and a little is added on February 23.\n Because the last observation follows the time of observation found by me by 2 days 21 hours 47 min., add the motion corresponding to this time, 1\u00b0 7\u2019: the position will come out 12\u00b0 26\u2019 Virgo. The agreement is thus very good\u2014it could not be better\u2014given that both of us [that is, Kepler and Fabricius] work independently and do not rely on the facilities used by Tycho Brahe.","1680":"VIII. On 1595 October 30 at 8h 20m, the planet was found at 17\u00b0 47\u2019 15\u201c Taurus,19 not far from the nonagesimal. We may thus be sure of the parallax, although we must take it into account. The latitude was 0\u00b0 5\u2019 10\u201c north. The sun\u2019s position was 16\u00b0 50\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio. The distance between the stars was 56\u2019 45\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 35\u201c; that of Mars, 22\u2019 54\u201c, as appears by comparing the nearby observations. The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 23\u2019 29\u201c. If the distance between the stars be divided by this, it comes out to 40\u2019 47\u201c of a day, or 16 hours 19 min. Therefore, the true opposition was 0h 39m PM on October 31. Mars\u2019s position was 17\u00b0 31\u2019 40\u201c Taurus. This needs no reduction to the orbit, as it is nearly at the node. The latitude was about 0\u00b0 8\u2019 north. But comparison with the preceding and following days shows a latitude of about 5\u2019 north.\nIX. Let, at any rate, Mars\u2019s position on 1597 December 10 at 8h 30m be 3\u00b0 45\u00bd\u2019 Cancer (as above) ^20. The sun\u2019s position was 29\u00b0 4\u2019 53\u201c Sagittarius. The distance between the stars was 4\u00b0 40\u2019 37\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 61\u2019 20\u201c, that of Mars 23\u2019 40\u201c (for in 1580 the diurnal motion in Gemini was 23\u2019, and in 1582, at 17\u00b0 Cancer, it was 24\u2019). Therefore, the sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 25\u2019 0\u201c. These data show that the time of true opposition followed 3 days 7 hours 14 min. later, on December 14 at 3h 44m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 2\u00b0 27\u2153\u2019 Cancer. The reduction to the orbit (quite ridiculous here, since the observation itself has an uncertainty of several minutes) requires the addition of about 52\u201c. Therefore, the corrected position was 2\u00b0 28\u2019 Cancer. The latitude, from the table, was 3\u00b0 33\u2019 north.\nOn the same night, the one following December 10, at 12\u2159h, Fabricius in East Frisia found Mars\u2019s position to be 3\u00b0 40\u00bc\u2019 Cancer with latitude 3\u00b0 23\u2019 N. In this observation the longitude comes out nearly the same. For the motion over 3h 40m is 3\u00bd\u2019, so that in the Brahean observation too, at 12\u2159h Mars could have been at 3\u00b0 42\u2019 Cancer\u2014two minutes beyond the Fabrician position.\nX. On 1600 January 13\/23 at 11h 40m, the time being adjusted to Uraniborg time, the planet was observed at 10\u00b0 38\u2019 46\u201c Leo ^21. The sun\u2019s position was 3\u00b0 26\u2019 30\u201c Aquarius. The stars were 7\u00b0 12\u2019 16\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion for the next few days was 1\u00b0 1\u2019 3\u201c; that of Mars, 23\u2019 44\u201c. The sum: 1\u00b0 24\u2019 47\u201c. The opposition therefore followed 5 days 2h 22m after; that is, on January 19\/29 at 2h 2m in the morning, before dawn. Mars was at 8\u00b0 38\u2019 Leo. There is no need for reduction, since it is near the limit. The latitude, from the table, was 4\u00b0 30\u2019 50\u201c N.\nXI. On the evening of 1602 Febr. 18\/28 at 10h 30m, using the Tychonic  instruments (with the help of the learned Matthias Seiffard,22 bequeathed us by Tycho), I took the distance of Mars from the middle star of the tail of Ursa Major 23 to be 52\u00b0 22\u2019. And since the distance between Cor Leonis and Procyon was 37\u00b0 22\u2019 20\u201c, which should have been 37\u00b0 19\u2019 50\u201c,24 we know that the sextant reads 2\u00bd minutes high. Therefore, the corrected distance of Mars from the tail of Ursa was 52\u00b0 19\u00bd\u2019. And since the latitude of the fixed star is 56\u00b0 22\u2019, the remainder, by subtraction, is 4\u00b0 2\u00bd\u2019\u2014supposing that Mars was at precisely the same longitude as the fixed star. But because there was a difference of 3\u00be degrees between them (as is clear from the following observations), a slight correction is required.\n For let AB be 3\u00b0 43\u2019 30\u201c on a parallel close to the ecliptic, B Mars, C the fixed star, and BC 52\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c. Dividing the secant of BC by the secant of AB gives the  secant of CA, 52\u00b0 14\u2019, which, subtracted from 56\u00b0 22\u2019 (the latitude of the fixed star) leaves 4\u00b0 8\u2019 north as Mars\u2019s observed latitude. At the same time, we found 19\u00b0 23\u2019 between Mars and Cor Leonis (19\u00b0 20\u00bd corrected), and 21\u00b0 20\u2019 between Mars and the bright star in the wing of Virgo25 (21\u00b0 17\u00bd\u2019 corrected). From these two distances (using the latitudes of the stars and Mars), Mars\u2019s longitude is found to be 13\u00b0 19\u2019 6\u201c Virgo, by consensus of all measurements.\nAlternatively, the meridian altitude of Mars was found at 12h 40m, using two quadrants, to be 50\u00b0 19\u2019, while the tail of Leo26 was 56\u00b0 45\u2019. Therefore, from the declinations and right ascensions of the fixed stars and our distances, Mars\u2019s position is determined as 13\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c Virgo, latitude 4\u00b0 7\u2019 55\u201c ^27. This is the Tychonic procedure. I have included the other for the sake of showing a consensus, and also that it might be evident that despite the lack of absolute perfection in the demonstration, short cuts either in computation or in our understanding can under certain circumstances be applied. For in that previous procedure there is less in the actual work than in the reporting of it. At Prague, 5\u00b0 Scorpio was rising ^28. Therefore, the nonagesimal was about 32\u00bd\u00b0 from the zenith. And since Mars\u2019s distance from the earth was rather more than half the sun\u2019s distance, the resulting parallax of about 5\u2019 opposite 32\u00bd\u00b0 in our parallactic table, shows a latitudinal parallax of 2\u2019 41\u201c. Thus the latitude as seen from the middle of the earth would be 4\u00b0 10\u2154\u2019 north. And because the altitude of the nonagesimal was 57\u00bd\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax at the horizon was 4\u2019 13\u201c. But since Mars was 38\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, the longitudinal parallax corresponding to this position is 2\u2019 36\u201c, and if this be eliminated, Mars would be placed at about 13\u00b0 18\u2019 Virgo ^29. At that moment, the sun\u2019s position was 10\u00b0 16\u2019 42\u201c Pisces. The distance between the bodies was 3\u00b0 1\u2019 18\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 4\u201c, and that of Mars, 24\u2019 5\u201c (for it was 24\u2019 18\u201c at 21\u00b0 Leo in 1585, and 24\u2019 at 26 Virgo in 1587). The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 24\u2019 9\u201c. The true opposition therefore followed 2 days 3 hours 43 minutes later, on 21 February\/3 March before dawn at 2h 13m, Mars being at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 35\u201c Virgo. Forty seconds must be subtracted to reduce the position to the orbit, putting Mars at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 Virgo, with slightly less latitude than before, since the latitude was then decreasing. It was therefore about 4\u00b0 10\u2019, or 4\u00b0 7\u2153\u2019 if the parallax be neglected.\n But because, since Tycho\u2019s death, we have not made frequent observations nor continued them over several days, it would be best, for certainty\u2019s sake, also to make use of those observations which David Fabricius of East Frisia, a sedulous practitioner of astronomy, has communicated to me.\nOn February 16, old style, at 5h in the morning, he took the planet\u2019s distances from the tail of Leo (for the latitude), from the neck of Leo,30 and, on the other hand, from the bright star in the southern wing of Virgo, so as to check its longitude by working it out twice.\nI could make use of Tycho\u2019s line of reasoning, which he routinely adopted in volume I of the Progymnasmata when (as here) the declination of the planet was not known. But because that method extends to ten operations, I prefer for the sake of brevity to proceed as I did before with my own observations. Here there are no hidden dangers.\nFirst, the star in the wing of Virgo, adjusted to our time, is at 4\u00b0 36\u2019 30\u201c Libra with latitude 2\u00b0 50\u2019 north. Fabricius found that Mars is 20\u00b0 18\u2019 westward from it on the zodiac, which puts Mars at about 14\u00b0 18\u2019 30\u201c Virgo. This is a preliminary, approximate figure: the longitude will shortly be corrected. Now the tail of Leo31 is at 16\u00b0 4\u2019 Virgo, with latitude 12\u00b0 18\u2019 North, and Mars was found to be 8\u00b0 17\u2019 distant from the Tail. What is sought is the distance of its parallel from the Tail, since the difference in longitude is 1\u00b0 45\u2019. Dividing the secant of 8\u00b0 17\u2019 by the secant of 1\u00b0 45\u2019 gives the secant of 8\u00b0 6\u2019, the arc sought. This subtracted from the fixed star\u2019s northern latitude of 12\u00b0 18\u2019 leaves Mars\u2019s latitude, 4\u00b0 12\u2019 north. This I now take as determined, and compare it with the latitudes of the fixed stars according to the laws of trigonometry. From the Wing of Virgo, I find Mars\u2019s longitude to be 14\u00b0 19\u2019 Virgo; from the Neck of Leo, 14\u00b0 23\u2019 36\u201c. The mean of these two is 14\u00b0 21\u2019 18\u201c Virgo. And since the sextant gave distances larger than the truth, the latitude would come out at 4\u00b0 14\u2019 north.\nOn the night following February 23, at 12h, he observed Mars in relation to five fixed stars: the Tail of Leo and Arcturus for latitude, and for the longitude, in the first instance, Spica (which followed it), and, in the second, the Neck of Leo and Cor Leonis (which preceded it).\nBy a rough estimate, I foresee that Mars is going to fall at 11\u00bc\u00b0 Virgo. It was found to be 9\u00b0 24\u2019 from the Tail of Leo, and hence, its latitude comes out at 4\u00b0 6\u2019 ^32. And now, through this and the latitudes of the fixed stars, together with their distances (17\u00b0 26\u2019 from Regulus, 17\u00b0 51\u2019 from the Neck of Leo, 37\u00b0 28\u2019 from Spica, 44\u00b0 15\u2019 from Arcturus), Mars\u2019s position comes out at 11\u00b0 21\u2019 23\u201c Virgo (from Regulus), 11\u00b0 20\u2019 52\u201c Virgo (from the Neck of Leo), and 11\u00b0 17\u2019 40\u201c (from Spica). Again (as you see) the distances err in being too great. For from the Heart and the Neck [of Leo], Mars is pushed a little eastward, and from Spica and Arcturus a little westward, and more from Arcturus, owing to its greater northern latitude ^33. The mean (ignoring Arcturus), 11\u00b0 19\u2019 20\u201c Virgo, is very nearly true. Also, the latitude is greater, namely, 4\u00b0 7\u2019 40\u201c north. Now from February 15 at 17h to 23 February at 12h, a period of 7 days 19 hours, Mars moved 3\u00b0 0\u2019: 180 minutes in 187 hours. That is, about one minute per hour. And if you wish to take it into account, the parallax (if any) is subtracted from the longitude on February 16 and a little is added on February 23.\n Because the last observation follows the time of observation found by me by 2 days 21 hours 47 min., add the motion corresponding to this time, 1\u00b0 7\u2019: the position will come out 12\u00b0 26\u2019 Virgo. The agreement is thus very good\u2014it could not be better\u2014given that both of us [that is, Kepler and Fabricius] work independently and do not rely on the facilities used by Tycho Brahe.","1681":"VIII. On 1595 October 30 at 8h 20m, the planet was found at 17\u00b0 47\u2019 15\u201c Taurus,19 not far from the nonagesimal. We may thus be sure of the parallax, although we must take it into account. The latitude was 0\u00b0 5\u2019 10\u201c north. The sun\u2019s position was 16\u00b0 50\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio. The distance between the stars was 56\u2019 45\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 35\u201c; that of Mars, 22\u2019 54\u201c, as appears by comparing the nearby observations. The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 23\u2019 29\u201c. If the distance between the stars be divided by this, it comes out to 40\u2019 47\u201c of a day, or 16 hours 19 min. Therefore, the true opposition was 0h 39m PM on October 31. Mars\u2019s position was 17\u00b0 31\u2019 40\u201c Taurus. This needs no reduction to the orbit, as it is nearly at the node. The latitude was about 0\u00b0 8\u2019 north. But comparison with the preceding and following days shows a latitude of about 5\u2019 north.\nIX. Let, at any rate, Mars\u2019s position on 1597 December 10 at 8h 30m be 3\u00b0 45\u00bd\u2019 Cancer (as above) ^20. The sun\u2019s position was 29\u00b0 4\u2019 53\u201c Sagittarius. The distance between the stars was 4\u00b0 40\u2019 37\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 61\u2019 20\u201c, that of Mars 23\u2019 40\u201c (for in 1580 the diurnal motion in Gemini was 23\u2019, and in 1582, at 17\u00b0 Cancer, it was 24\u2019). Therefore, the sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 25\u2019 0\u201c. These data show that the time of true opposition followed 3 days 7 hours 14 min. later, on December 14 at 3h 44m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 2\u00b0 27\u2153\u2019 Cancer. The reduction to the orbit (quite ridiculous here, since the observation itself has an uncertainty of several minutes) requires the addition of about 52\u201c. Therefore, the corrected position was 2\u00b0 28\u2019 Cancer. The latitude, from the table, was 3\u00b0 33\u2019 north.\nOn the same night, the one following December 10, at 12\u2159h, Fabricius in East Frisia found Mars\u2019s position to be 3\u00b0 40\u00bc\u2019 Cancer with latitude 3\u00b0 23\u2019 N. In this observation the longitude comes out nearly the same. For the motion over 3h 40m is 3\u00bd\u2019, so that in the Brahean observation too, at 12\u2159h Mars could have been at 3\u00b0 42\u2019 Cancer\u2014two minutes beyond the Fabrician position.\nX. On 1600 January 13\/23 at 11h 40m, the time being adjusted to Uraniborg time, the planet was observed at 10\u00b0 38\u2019 46\u201c Leo ^21. The sun\u2019s position was 3\u00b0 26\u2019 30\u201c Aquarius. The stars were 7\u00b0 12\u2019 16\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion for the next few days was 1\u00b0 1\u2019 3\u201c; that of Mars, 23\u2019 44\u201c. The sum: 1\u00b0 24\u2019 47\u201c. The opposition therefore followed 5 days 2h 22m after; that is, on January 19\/29 at 2h 2m in the morning, before dawn. Mars was at 8\u00b0 38\u2019 Leo. There is no need for reduction, since it is near the limit. The latitude, from the table, was 4\u00b0 30\u2019 50\u201c N.\nXI. On the evening of 1602 Febr. 18\/28 at 10h 30m, using the Tychonic  instruments (with the help of the learned Matthias Seiffard,22 bequeathed us by Tycho), I took the distance of Mars from the middle star of the tail of Ursa Major 23 to be 52\u00b0 22\u2019. And since the distance between Cor Leonis and Procyon was 37\u00b0 22\u2019 20\u201c, which should have been 37\u00b0 19\u2019 50\u201c,24 we know that the sextant reads 2\u00bd minutes high. Therefore, the corrected distance of Mars from the tail of Ursa was 52\u00b0 19\u00bd\u2019. And since the latitude of the fixed star is 56\u00b0 22\u2019, the remainder, by subtraction, is 4\u00b0 2\u00bd\u2019\u2014supposing that Mars was at precisely the same longitude as the fixed star. But because there was a difference of 3\u00be degrees between them (as is clear from the following observations), a slight correction is required.\n For let AB be 3\u00b0 43\u2019 30\u201c on a parallel close to the ecliptic, B Mars, C the fixed star, and BC 52\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c. Dividing the secant of BC by the secant of AB gives the  secant of CA, 52\u00b0 14\u2019, which, subtracted from 56\u00b0 22\u2019 (the latitude of the fixed star) leaves 4\u00b0 8\u2019 north as Mars\u2019s observed latitude. At the same time, we found 19\u00b0 23\u2019 between Mars and Cor Leonis (19\u00b0 20\u00bd corrected), and 21\u00b0 20\u2019 between Mars and the bright star in the wing of Virgo25 (21\u00b0 17\u00bd\u2019 corrected). From these two distances (using the latitudes of the stars and Mars), Mars\u2019s longitude is found to be 13\u00b0 19\u2019 6\u201c Virgo, by consensus of all measurements.\nAlternatively, the meridian altitude of Mars was found at 12h 40m, using two quadrants, to be 50\u00b0 19\u2019, while the tail of Leo26 was 56\u00b0 45\u2019. Therefore, from the declinations and right ascensions of the fixed stars and our distances, Mars\u2019s position is determined as 13\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c Virgo, latitude 4\u00b0 7\u2019 55\u201c ^27. This is the Tychonic procedure. I have included the other for the sake of showing a consensus, and also that it might be evident that despite the lack of absolute perfection in the demonstration, short cuts either in computation or in our understanding can under certain circumstances be applied. For in that previous procedure there is less in the actual work than in the reporting of it. At Prague, 5\u00b0 Scorpio was rising ^28. Therefore, the nonagesimal was about 32\u00bd\u00b0 from the zenith. And since Mars\u2019s distance from the earth was rather more than half the sun\u2019s distance, the resulting parallax of about 5\u2019 opposite 32\u00bd\u00b0 in our parallactic table, shows a latitudinal parallax of 2\u2019 41\u201c. Thus the latitude as seen from the middle of the earth would be 4\u00b0 10\u2154\u2019 north. And because the altitude of the nonagesimal was 57\u00bd\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax at the horizon was 4\u2019 13\u201c. But since Mars was 38\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, the longitudinal parallax corresponding to this position is 2\u2019 36\u201c, and if this be eliminated, Mars would be placed at about 13\u00b0 18\u2019 Virgo ^29. At that moment, the sun\u2019s position was 10\u00b0 16\u2019 42\u201c Pisces. The distance between the bodies was 3\u00b0 1\u2019 18\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 4\u201c, and that of Mars, 24\u2019 5\u201c (for it was 24\u2019 18\u201c at 21\u00b0 Leo in 1585, and 24\u2019 at 26 Virgo in 1587). The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 24\u2019 9\u201c. The true opposition therefore followed 2 days 3 hours 43 minutes later, on 21 February\/3 March before dawn at 2h 13m, Mars being at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 35\u201c Virgo. Forty seconds must be subtracted to reduce the position to the orbit, putting Mars at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 Virgo, with slightly less latitude than before, since the latitude was then decreasing. It was therefore about 4\u00b0 10\u2019, or 4\u00b0 7\u2153\u2019 if the parallax be neglected.\n But because, since Tycho\u2019s death, we have not made frequent observations nor continued them over several days, it would be best, for certainty\u2019s sake, also to make use of those observations which David Fabricius of East Frisia, a sedulous practitioner of astronomy, has communicated to me.\nOn February 16, old style, at 5h in the morning, he took the planet\u2019s distances from the tail of Leo (for the latitude), from the neck of Leo,30 and, on the other hand, from the bright star in the southern wing of Virgo, so as to check its longitude by working it out twice.\nI could make use of Tycho\u2019s line of reasoning, which he routinely adopted in volume I of the Progymnasmata when (as here) the declination of the planet was not known. But because that method extends to ten operations, I prefer for the sake of brevity to proceed as I did before with my own observations. Here there are no hidden dangers.\nFirst, the star in the wing of Virgo, adjusted to our time, is at 4\u00b0 36\u2019 30\u201c Libra with latitude 2\u00b0 50\u2019 north. Fabricius found that Mars is 20\u00b0 18\u2019 westward from it on the zodiac, which puts Mars at about 14\u00b0 18\u2019 30\u201c Virgo. This is a preliminary, approximate figure: the longitude will shortly be corrected. Now the tail of Leo31 is at 16\u00b0 4\u2019 Virgo, with latitude 12\u00b0 18\u2019 North, and Mars was found to be 8\u00b0 17\u2019 distant from the Tail. What is sought is the distance of its parallel from the Tail, since the difference in longitude is 1\u00b0 45\u2019. Dividing the secant of 8\u00b0 17\u2019 by the secant of 1\u00b0 45\u2019 gives the secant of 8\u00b0 6\u2019, the arc sought. This subtracted from the fixed star\u2019s northern latitude of 12\u00b0 18\u2019 leaves Mars\u2019s latitude, 4\u00b0 12\u2019 north. This I now take as determined, and compare it with the latitudes of the fixed stars according to the laws of trigonometry. From the Wing of Virgo, I find Mars\u2019s longitude to be 14\u00b0 19\u2019 Virgo; from the Neck of Leo, 14\u00b0 23\u2019 36\u201c. The mean of these two is 14\u00b0 21\u2019 18\u201c Virgo. And since the sextant gave distances larger than the truth, the latitude would come out at 4\u00b0 14\u2019 north.\nOn the night following February 23, at 12h, he observed Mars in relation to five fixed stars: the Tail of Leo and Arcturus for latitude, and for the longitude, in the first instance, Spica (which followed it), and, in the second, the Neck of Leo and Cor Leonis (which preceded it).\nBy a rough estimate, I foresee that Mars is going to fall at 11\u00bc\u00b0 Virgo. It was found to be 9\u00b0 24\u2019 from the Tail of Leo, and hence, its latitude comes out at 4\u00b0 6\u2019 ^32. And now, through this and the latitudes of the fixed stars, together with their distances (17\u00b0 26\u2019 from Regulus, 17\u00b0 51\u2019 from the Neck of Leo, 37\u00b0 28\u2019 from Spica, 44\u00b0 15\u2019 from Arcturus), Mars\u2019s position comes out at 11\u00b0 21\u2019 23\u201c Virgo (from Regulus), 11\u00b0 20\u2019 52\u201c Virgo (from the Neck of Leo), and 11\u00b0 17\u2019 40\u201c (from Spica). Again (as you see) the distances err in being too great. For from the Heart and the Neck [of Leo], Mars is pushed a little eastward, and from Spica and Arcturus a little westward, and more from Arcturus, owing to its greater northern latitude ^33. The mean (ignoring Arcturus), 11\u00b0 19\u2019 20\u201c Virgo, is very nearly true. Also, the latitude is greater, namely, 4\u00b0 7\u2019 40\u201c north. Now from February 15 at 17h to 23 February at 12h, a period of 7 days 19 hours, Mars moved 3\u00b0 0\u2019: 180 minutes in 187 hours. That is, about one minute per hour. And if you wish to take it into account, the parallax (if any) is subtracted from the longitude on February 16 and a little is added on February 23.\n Because the last observation follows the time of observation found by me by 2 days 21 hours 47 min., add the motion corresponding to this time, 1\u00b0 7\u2019: the position will come out 12\u00b0 26\u2019 Virgo. The agreement is thus very good\u2014it could not be better\u2014given that both of us [that is, Kepler and Fabricius] work independently and do not rely on the facilities used by Tycho Brahe.","1682":"VIII. On 1595 October 30 at 8h 20m, the planet was found at 17\u00b0 47\u2019 15\u201c Taurus,19 not far from the nonagesimal. We may thus be sure of the parallax, although we must take it into account. The latitude was 0\u00b0 5\u2019 10\u201c north. The sun\u2019s position was 16\u00b0 50\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio. The distance between the stars was 56\u2019 45\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 35\u201c; that of Mars, 22\u2019 54\u201c, as appears by comparing the nearby observations. The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 23\u2019 29\u201c. If the distance between the stars be divided by this, it comes out to 40\u2019 47\u201c of a day, or 16 hours 19 min. Therefore, the true opposition was 0h 39m PM on October 31. Mars\u2019s position was 17\u00b0 31\u2019 40\u201c Taurus. This needs no reduction to the orbit, as it is nearly at the node. The latitude was about 0\u00b0 8\u2019 north. But comparison with the preceding and following days shows a latitude of about 5\u2019 north.\nIX. Let, at any rate, Mars\u2019s position on 1597 December 10 at 8h 30m be 3\u00b0 45\u00bd\u2019 Cancer (as above) ^20. The sun\u2019s position was 29\u00b0 4\u2019 53\u201c Sagittarius. The distance between the stars was 4\u00b0 40\u2019 37\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 61\u2019 20\u201c, that of Mars 23\u2019 40\u201c (for in 1580 the diurnal motion in Gemini was 23\u2019, and in 1582, at 17\u00b0 Cancer, it was 24\u2019). Therefore, the sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 25\u2019 0\u201c. These data show that the time of true opposition followed 3 days 7 hours 14 min. later, on December 14 at 3h 44m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 2\u00b0 27\u2153\u2019 Cancer. The reduction to the orbit (quite ridiculous here, since the observation itself has an uncertainty of several minutes) requires the addition of about 52\u201c. Therefore, the corrected position was 2\u00b0 28\u2019 Cancer. The latitude, from the table, was 3\u00b0 33\u2019 north.\nOn the same night, the one following December 10, at 12\u2159h, Fabricius in East Frisia found Mars\u2019s position to be 3\u00b0 40\u00bc\u2019 Cancer with latitude 3\u00b0 23\u2019 N. In this observation the longitude comes out nearly the same. For the motion over 3h 40m is 3\u00bd\u2019, so that in the Brahean observation too, at 12\u2159h Mars could have been at 3\u00b0 42\u2019 Cancer\u2014two minutes beyond the Fabrician position.\nX. On 1600 January 13\/23 at 11h 40m, the time being adjusted to Uraniborg time, the planet was observed at 10\u00b0 38\u2019 46\u201c Leo ^21. The sun\u2019s position was 3\u00b0 26\u2019 30\u201c Aquarius. The stars were 7\u00b0 12\u2019 16\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion for the next few days was 1\u00b0 1\u2019 3\u201c; that of Mars, 23\u2019 44\u201c. The sum: 1\u00b0 24\u2019 47\u201c. The opposition therefore followed 5 days 2h 22m after; that is, on January 19\/29 at 2h 2m in the morning, before dawn. Mars was at 8\u00b0 38\u2019 Leo. There is no need for reduction, since it is near the limit. The latitude, from the table, was 4\u00b0 30\u2019 50\u201c N.\nXI. On the evening of 1602 Febr. 18\/28 at 10h 30m, using the Tychonic  instruments (with the help of the learned Matthias Seiffard,22 bequeathed us by Tycho), I took the distance of Mars from the middle star of the tail of Ursa Major 23 to be 52\u00b0 22\u2019. And since the distance between Cor Leonis and Procyon was 37\u00b0 22\u2019 20\u201c, which should have been 37\u00b0 19\u2019 50\u201c,24 we know that the sextant reads 2\u00bd minutes high. Therefore, the corrected distance of Mars from the tail of Ursa was 52\u00b0 19\u00bd\u2019. And since the latitude of the fixed star is 56\u00b0 22\u2019, the remainder, by subtraction, is 4\u00b0 2\u00bd\u2019\u2014supposing that Mars was at precisely the same longitude as the fixed star. But because there was a difference of 3\u00be degrees between them (as is clear from the following observations), a slight correction is required.\n For let AB be 3\u00b0 43\u2019 30\u201c on a parallel close to the ecliptic, B Mars, C the fixed star, and BC 52\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c. Dividing the secant of BC by the secant of AB gives the  secant of CA, 52\u00b0 14\u2019, which, subtracted from 56\u00b0 22\u2019 (the latitude of the fixed star) leaves 4\u00b0 8\u2019 north as Mars\u2019s observed latitude. At the same time, we found 19\u00b0 23\u2019 between Mars and Cor Leonis (19\u00b0 20\u00bd corrected), and 21\u00b0 20\u2019 between Mars and the bright star in the wing of Virgo25 (21\u00b0 17\u00bd\u2019 corrected). From these two distances (using the latitudes of the stars and Mars), Mars\u2019s longitude is found to be 13\u00b0 19\u2019 6\u201c Virgo, by consensus of all measurements.\nAlternatively, the meridian altitude of Mars was found at 12h 40m, using two quadrants, to be 50\u00b0 19\u2019, while the tail of Leo26 was 56\u00b0 45\u2019. Therefore, from the declinations and right ascensions of the fixed stars and our distances, Mars\u2019s position is determined as 13\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c Virgo, latitude 4\u00b0 7\u2019 55\u201c ^27. This is the Tychonic procedure. I have included the other for the sake of showing a consensus, and also that it might be evident that despite the lack of absolute perfection in the demonstration, short cuts either in computation or in our understanding can under certain circumstances be applied. For in that previous procedure there is less in the actual work than in the reporting of it. At Prague, 5\u00b0 Scorpio was rising ^28. Therefore, the nonagesimal was about 32\u00bd\u00b0 from the zenith. And since Mars\u2019s distance from the earth was rather more than half the sun\u2019s distance, the resulting parallax of about 5\u2019 opposite 32\u00bd\u00b0 in our parallactic table, shows a latitudinal parallax of 2\u2019 41\u201c. Thus the latitude as seen from the middle of the earth would be 4\u00b0 10\u2154\u2019 north. And because the altitude of the nonagesimal was 57\u00bd\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax at the horizon was 4\u2019 13\u201c. But since Mars was 38\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, the longitudinal parallax corresponding to this position is 2\u2019 36\u201c, and if this be eliminated, Mars would be placed at about 13\u00b0 18\u2019 Virgo ^29. At that moment, the sun\u2019s position was 10\u00b0 16\u2019 42\u201c Pisces. The distance between the bodies was 3\u00b0 1\u2019 18\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 4\u201c, and that of Mars, 24\u2019 5\u201c (for it was 24\u2019 18\u201c at 21\u00b0 Leo in 1585, and 24\u2019 at 26 Virgo in 1587). The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 24\u2019 9\u201c. The true opposition therefore followed 2 days 3 hours 43 minutes later, on 21 February\/3 March before dawn at 2h 13m, Mars being at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 35\u201c Virgo. Forty seconds must be subtracted to reduce the position to the orbit, putting Mars at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 Virgo, with slightly less latitude than before, since the latitude was then decreasing. It was therefore about 4\u00b0 10\u2019, or 4\u00b0 7\u2153\u2019 if the parallax be neglected.\n But because, since Tycho\u2019s death, we have not made frequent observations nor continued them over several days, it would be best, for certainty\u2019s sake, also to make use of those observations which David Fabricius of East Frisia, a sedulous practitioner of astronomy, has communicated to me.\nOn February 16, old style, at 5h in the morning, he took the planet\u2019s distances from the tail of Leo (for the latitude), from the neck of Leo,30 and, on the other hand, from the bright star in the southern wing of Virgo, so as to check its longitude by working it out twice.\nI could make use of Tycho\u2019s line of reasoning, which he routinely adopted in volume I of the Progymnasmata when (as here) the declination of the planet was not known. But because that method extends to ten operations, I prefer for the sake of brevity to proceed as I did before with my own observations. Here there are no hidden dangers.\nFirst, the star in the wing of Virgo, adjusted to our time, is at 4\u00b0 36\u2019 30\u201c Libra with latitude 2\u00b0 50\u2019 north. Fabricius found that Mars is 20\u00b0 18\u2019 westward from it on the zodiac, which puts Mars at about 14\u00b0 18\u2019 30\u201c Virgo. This is a preliminary, approximate figure: the longitude will shortly be corrected. Now the tail of Leo31 is at 16\u00b0 4\u2019 Virgo, with latitude 12\u00b0 18\u2019 North, and Mars was found to be 8\u00b0 17\u2019 distant from the Tail. What is sought is the distance of its parallel from the Tail, since the difference in longitude is 1\u00b0 45\u2019. Dividing the secant of 8\u00b0 17\u2019 by the secant of 1\u00b0 45\u2019 gives the secant of 8\u00b0 6\u2019, the arc sought. This subtracted from the fixed star\u2019s northern latitude of 12\u00b0 18\u2019 leaves Mars\u2019s latitude, 4\u00b0 12\u2019 north. This I now take as determined, and compare it with the latitudes of the fixed stars according to the laws of trigonometry. From the Wing of Virgo, I find Mars\u2019s longitude to be 14\u00b0 19\u2019 Virgo; from the Neck of Leo, 14\u00b0 23\u2019 36\u201c. The mean of these two is 14\u00b0 21\u2019 18\u201c Virgo. And since the sextant gave distances larger than the truth, the latitude would come out at 4\u00b0 14\u2019 north.\nOn the night following February 23, at 12h, he observed Mars in relation to five fixed stars: the Tail of Leo and Arcturus for latitude, and for the longitude, in the first instance, Spica (which followed it), and, in the second, the Neck of Leo and Cor Leonis (which preceded it).\nBy a rough estimate, I foresee that Mars is going to fall at 11\u00bc\u00b0 Virgo. It was found to be 9\u00b0 24\u2019 from the Tail of Leo, and hence, its latitude comes out at 4\u00b0 6\u2019 ^32. And now, through this and the latitudes of the fixed stars, together with their distances (17\u00b0 26\u2019 from Regulus, 17\u00b0 51\u2019 from the Neck of Leo, 37\u00b0 28\u2019 from Spica, 44\u00b0 15\u2019 from Arcturus), Mars\u2019s position comes out at 11\u00b0 21\u2019 23\u201c Virgo (from Regulus), 11\u00b0 20\u2019 52\u201c Virgo (from the Neck of Leo), and 11\u00b0 17\u2019 40\u201c (from Spica). Again (as you see) the distances err in being too great. For from the Heart and the Neck [of Leo], Mars is pushed a little eastward, and from Spica and Arcturus a little westward, and more from Arcturus, owing to its greater northern latitude ^33. The mean (ignoring Arcturus), 11\u00b0 19\u2019 20\u201c Virgo, is very nearly true. Also, the latitude is greater, namely, 4\u00b0 7\u2019 40\u201c north. Now from February 15 at 17h to 23 February at 12h, a period of 7 days 19 hours, Mars moved 3\u00b0 0\u2019: 180 minutes in 187 hours. That is, about one minute per hour. And if you wish to take it into account, the parallax (if any) is subtracted from the longitude on February 16 and a little is added on February 23.\n Because the last observation follows the time of observation found by me by 2 days 21 hours 47 min., add the motion corresponding to this time, 1\u00b0 7\u2019: the position will come out 12\u00b0 26\u2019 Virgo. The agreement is thus very good\u2014it could not be better\u2014given that both of us [that is, Kepler and Fabricius] work independently and do not rely on the facilities used by Tycho Brahe.","1683":"VIII. On 1595 October 30 at 8h 20m, the planet was found at 17\u00b0 47\u2019 15\u201c Taurus,19 not far from the nonagesimal. We may thus be sure of the parallax, although we must take it into account. The latitude was 0\u00b0 5\u2019 10\u201c north. The sun\u2019s position was 16\u00b0 50\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio. The distance between the stars was 56\u2019 45\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 35\u201c; that of Mars, 22\u2019 54\u201c, as appears by comparing the nearby observations. The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 23\u2019 29\u201c. If the distance between the stars be divided by this, it comes out to 40\u2019 47\u201c of a day, or 16 hours 19 min. Therefore, the true opposition was 0h 39m PM on October 31. Mars\u2019s position was 17\u00b0 31\u2019 40\u201c Taurus. This needs no reduction to the orbit, as it is nearly at the node. The latitude was about 0\u00b0 8\u2019 north. But comparison with the preceding and following days shows a latitude of about 5\u2019 north.\nIX. Let, at any rate, Mars\u2019s position on 1597 December 10 at 8h 30m be 3\u00b0 45\u00bd\u2019 Cancer (as above) ^20. The sun\u2019s position was 29\u00b0 4\u2019 53\u201c Sagittarius. The distance between the stars was 4\u00b0 40\u2019 37\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 61\u2019 20\u201c, that of Mars 23\u2019 40\u201c (for in 1580 the diurnal motion in Gemini was 23\u2019, and in 1582, at 17\u00b0 Cancer, it was 24\u2019). Therefore, the sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 25\u2019 0\u201c. These data show that the time of true opposition followed 3 days 7 hours 14 min. later, on December 14 at 3h 44m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 2\u00b0 27\u2153\u2019 Cancer. The reduction to the orbit (quite ridiculous here, since the observation itself has an uncertainty of several minutes) requires the addition of about 52\u201c. Therefore, the corrected position was 2\u00b0 28\u2019 Cancer. The latitude, from the table, was 3\u00b0 33\u2019 north.\nOn the same night, the one following December 10, at 12\u2159h, Fabricius in East Frisia found Mars\u2019s position to be 3\u00b0 40\u00bc\u2019 Cancer with latitude 3\u00b0 23\u2019 N. In this observation the longitude comes out nearly the same. For the motion over 3h 40m is 3\u00bd\u2019, so that in the Brahean observation too, at 12\u2159h Mars could have been at 3\u00b0 42\u2019 Cancer\u2014two minutes beyond the Fabrician position.\nX. On 1600 January 13\/23 at 11h 40m, the time being adjusted to Uraniborg time, the planet was observed at 10\u00b0 38\u2019 46\u201c Leo ^21. The sun\u2019s position was 3\u00b0 26\u2019 30\u201c Aquarius. The stars were 7\u00b0 12\u2019 16\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion for the next few days was 1\u00b0 1\u2019 3\u201c; that of Mars, 23\u2019 44\u201c. The sum: 1\u00b0 24\u2019 47\u201c. The opposition therefore followed 5 days 2h 22m after; that is, on January 19\/29 at 2h 2m in the morning, before dawn. Mars was at 8\u00b0 38\u2019 Leo. There is no need for reduction, since it is near the limit. The latitude, from the table, was 4\u00b0 30\u2019 50\u201c N.\nXI. On the evening of 1602 Febr. 18\/28 at 10h 30m, using the Tychonic  instruments (with the help of the learned Matthias Seiffard,22 bequeathed us by Tycho), I took the distance of Mars from the middle star of the tail of Ursa Major 23 to be 52\u00b0 22\u2019. And since the distance between Cor Leonis and Procyon was 37\u00b0 22\u2019 20\u201c, which should have been 37\u00b0 19\u2019 50\u201c,24 we know that the sextant reads 2\u00bd minutes high. Therefore, the corrected distance of Mars from the tail of Ursa was 52\u00b0 19\u00bd\u2019. And since the latitude of the fixed star is 56\u00b0 22\u2019, the remainder, by subtraction, is 4\u00b0 2\u00bd\u2019\u2014supposing that Mars was at precisely the same longitude as the fixed star. But because there was a difference of 3\u00be degrees between them (as is clear from the following observations), a slight correction is required.\n For let AB be 3\u00b0 43\u2019 30\u201c on a parallel close to the ecliptic, B Mars, C the fixed star, and BC 52\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c. Dividing the secant of BC by the secant of AB gives the  secant of CA, 52\u00b0 14\u2019, which, subtracted from 56\u00b0 22\u2019 (the latitude of the fixed star) leaves 4\u00b0 8\u2019 north as Mars\u2019s observed latitude. At the same time, we found 19\u00b0 23\u2019 between Mars and Cor Leonis (19\u00b0 20\u00bd corrected), and 21\u00b0 20\u2019 between Mars and the bright star in the wing of Virgo25 (21\u00b0 17\u00bd\u2019 corrected). From these two distances (using the latitudes of the stars and Mars), Mars\u2019s longitude is found to be 13\u00b0 19\u2019 6\u201c Virgo, by consensus of all measurements.\nAlternatively, the meridian altitude of Mars was found at 12h 40m, using two quadrants, to be 50\u00b0 19\u2019, while the tail of Leo26 was 56\u00b0 45\u2019. Therefore, from the declinations and right ascensions of the fixed stars and our distances, Mars\u2019s position is determined as 13\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c Virgo, latitude 4\u00b0 7\u2019 55\u201c ^27. This is the Tychonic procedure. I have included the other for the sake of showing a consensus, and also that it might be evident that despite the lack of absolute perfection in the demonstration, short cuts either in computation or in our understanding can under certain circumstances be applied. For in that previous procedure there is less in the actual work than in the reporting of it. At Prague, 5\u00b0 Scorpio was rising ^28. Therefore, the nonagesimal was about 32\u00bd\u00b0 from the zenith. And since Mars\u2019s distance from the earth was rather more than half the sun\u2019s distance, the resulting parallax of about 5\u2019 opposite 32\u00bd\u00b0 in our parallactic table, shows a latitudinal parallax of 2\u2019 41\u201c. Thus the latitude as seen from the middle of the earth would be 4\u00b0 10\u2154\u2019 north. And because the altitude of the nonagesimal was 57\u00bd\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax at the horizon was 4\u2019 13\u201c. But since Mars was 38\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, the longitudinal parallax corresponding to this position is 2\u2019 36\u201c, and if this be eliminated, Mars would be placed at about 13\u00b0 18\u2019 Virgo ^29. At that moment, the sun\u2019s position was 10\u00b0 16\u2019 42\u201c Pisces. The distance between the bodies was 3\u00b0 1\u2019 18\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 4\u201c, and that of Mars, 24\u2019 5\u201c (for it was 24\u2019 18\u201c at 21\u00b0 Leo in 1585, and 24\u2019 at 26 Virgo in 1587). The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 24\u2019 9\u201c. The true opposition therefore followed 2 days 3 hours 43 minutes later, on 21 February\/3 March before dawn at 2h 13m, Mars being at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 35\u201c Virgo. Forty seconds must be subtracted to reduce the position to the orbit, putting Mars at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 Virgo, with slightly less latitude than before, since the latitude was then decreasing. It was therefore about 4\u00b0 10\u2019, or 4\u00b0 7\u2153\u2019 if the parallax be neglected.\n But because, since Tycho\u2019s death, we have not made frequent observations nor continued them over several days, it would be best, for certainty\u2019s sake, also to make use of those observations which David Fabricius of East Frisia, a sedulous practitioner of astronomy, has communicated to me.\nOn February 16, old style, at 5h in the morning, he took the planet\u2019s distances from the tail of Leo (for the latitude), from the neck of Leo,30 and, on the other hand, from the bright star in the southern wing of Virgo, so as to check its longitude by working it out twice.\nI could make use of Tycho\u2019s line of reasoning, which he routinely adopted in volume I of the Progymnasmata when (as here) the declination of the planet was not known. But because that method extends to ten operations, I prefer for the sake of brevity to proceed as I did before with my own observations. Here there are no hidden dangers.\nFirst, the star in the wing of Virgo, adjusted to our time, is at 4\u00b0 36\u2019 30\u201c Libra with latitude 2\u00b0 50\u2019 north. Fabricius found that Mars is 20\u00b0 18\u2019 westward from it on the zodiac, which puts Mars at about 14\u00b0 18\u2019 30\u201c Virgo. This is a preliminary, approximate figure: the longitude will shortly be corrected. Now the tail of Leo31 is at 16\u00b0 4\u2019 Virgo, with latitude 12\u00b0 18\u2019 North, and Mars was found to be 8\u00b0 17\u2019 distant from the Tail. What is sought is the distance of its parallel from the Tail, since the difference in longitude is 1\u00b0 45\u2019. Dividing the secant of 8\u00b0 17\u2019 by the secant of 1\u00b0 45\u2019 gives the secant of 8\u00b0 6\u2019, the arc sought. This subtracted from the fixed star\u2019s northern latitude of 12\u00b0 18\u2019 leaves Mars\u2019s latitude, 4\u00b0 12\u2019 north. This I now take as determined, and compare it with the latitudes of the fixed stars according to the laws of trigonometry. From the Wing of Virgo, I find Mars\u2019s longitude to be 14\u00b0 19\u2019 Virgo; from the Neck of Leo, 14\u00b0 23\u2019 36\u201c. The mean of these two is 14\u00b0 21\u2019 18\u201c Virgo. And since the sextant gave distances larger than the truth, the latitude would come out at 4\u00b0 14\u2019 north.\nOn the night following February 23, at 12h, he observed Mars in relation to five fixed stars: the Tail of Leo and Arcturus for latitude, and for the longitude, in the first instance, Spica (which followed it), and, in the second, the Neck of Leo and Cor Leonis (which preceded it).\nBy a rough estimate, I foresee that Mars is going to fall at 11\u00bc\u00b0 Virgo. It was found to be 9\u00b0 24\u2019 from the Tail of Leo, and hence, its latitude comes out at 4\u00b0 6\u2019 ^32. And now, through this and the latitudes of the fixed stars, together with their distances (17\u00b0 26\u2019 from Regulus, 17\u00b0 51\u2019 from the Neck of Leo, 37\u00b0 28\u2019 from Spica, 44\u00b0 15\u2019 from Arcturus), Mars\u2019s position comes out at 11\u00b0 21\u2019 23\u201c Virgo (from Regulus), 11\u00b0 20\u2019 52\u201c Virgo (from the Neck of Leo), and 11\u00b0 17\u2019 40\u201c (from Spica). Again (as you see) the distances err in being too great. For from the Heart and the Neck [of Leo], Mars is pushed a little eastward, and from Spica and Arcturus a little westward, and more from Arcturus, owing to its greater northern latitude ^33. The mean (ignoring Arcturus), 11\u00b0 19\u2019 20\u201c Virgo, is very nearly true. Also, the latitude is greater, namely, 4\u00b0 7\u2019 40\u201c north. Now from February 15 at 17h to 23 February at 12h, a period of 7 days 19 hours, Mars moved 3\u00b0 0\u2019: 180 minutes in 187 hours. That is, about one minute per hour. And if you wish to take it into account, the parallax (if any) is subtracted from the longitude on February 16 and a little is added on February 23.\n Because the last observation follows the time of observation found by me by 2 days 21 hours 47 min., add the motion corresponding to this time, 1\u00b0 7\u2019: the position will come out 12\u00b0 26\u2019 Virgo. The agreement is thus very good\u2014it could not be better\u2014given that both of us [that is, Kepler and Fabricius] work independently and do not rely on the facilities used by Tycho Brahe.","1684":"VIII. On 1595 October 30 at 8h 20m, the planet was found at 17\u00b0 47\u2019 15\u201c Taurus,19 not far from the nonagesimal. We may thus be sure of the parallax, although we must take it into account. The latitude was 0\u00b0 5\u2019 10\u201c north. The sun\u2019s position was 16\u00b0 50\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio. The distance between the stars was 56\u2019 45\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 35\u201c; that of Mars, 22\u2019 54\u201c, as appears by comparing the nearby observations. The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 23\u2019 29\u201c. If the distance between the stars be divided by this, it comes out to 40\u2019 47\u201c of a day, or 16 hours 19 min. Therefore, the true opposition was 0h 39m PM on October 31. Mars\u2019s position was 17\u00b0 31\u2019 40\u201c Taurus. This needs no reduction to the orbit, as it is nearly at the node. The latitude was about 0\u00b0 8\u2019 north. But comparison with the preceding and following days shows a latitude of about 5\u2019 north.\nIX. Let, at any rate, Mars\u2019s position on 1597 December 10 at 8h 30m be 3\u00b0 45\u00bd\u2019 Cancer (as above) ^20. The sun\u2019s position was 29\u00b0 4\u2019 53\u201c Sagittarius. The distance between the stars was 4\u00b0 40\u2019 37\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 61\u2019 20\u201c, that of Mars 23\u2019 40\u201c (for in 1580 the diurnal motion in Gemini was 23\u2019, and in 1582, at 17\u00b0 Cancer, it was 24\u2019). Therefore, the sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 25\u2019 0\u201c. These data show that the time of true opposition followed 3 days 7 hours 14 min. later, on December 14 at 3h 44m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 2\u00b0 27\u2153\u2019 Cancer. The reduction to the orbit (quite ridiculous here, since the observation itself has an uncertainty of several minutes) requires the addition of about 52\u201c. Therefore, the corrected position was 2\u00b0 28\u2019 Cancer. The latitude, from the table, was 3\u00b0 33\u2019 north.\nOn the same night, the one following December 10, at 12\u2159h, Fabricius in East Frisia found Mars\u2019s position to be 3\u00b0 40\u00bc\u2019 Cancer with latitude 3\u00b0 23\u2019 N. In this observation the longitude comes out nearly the same. For the motion over 3h 40m is 3\u00bd\u2019, so that in the Brahean observation too, at 12\u2159h Mars could have been at 3\u00b0 42\u2019 Cancer\u2014two minutes beyond the Fabrician position.\nX. On 1600 January 13\/23 at 11h 40m, the time being adjusted to Uraniborg time, the planet was observed at 10\u00b0 38\u2019 46\u201c Leo ^21. The sun\u2019s position was 3\u00b0 26\u2019 30\u201c Aquarius. The stars were 7\u00b0 12\u2019 16\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion for the next few days was 1\u00b0 1\u2019 3\u201c; that of Mars, 23\u2019 44\u201c. The sum: 1\u00b0 24\u2019 47\u201c. The opposition therefore followed 5 days 2h 22m after; that is, on January 19\/29 at 2h 2m in the morning, before dawn. Mars was at 8\u00b0 38\u2019 Leo. There is no need for reduction, since it is near the limit. The latitude, from the table, was 4\u00b0 30\u2019 50\u201c N.\nXI. On the evening of 1602 Febr. 18\/28 at 10h 30m, using the Tychonic  instruments (with the help of the learned Matthias Seiffard,22 bequeathed us by Tycho), I took the distance of Mars from the middle star of the tail of Ursa Major 23 to be 52\u00b0 22\u2019. And since the distance between Cor Leonis and Procyon was 37\u00b0 22\u2019 20\u201c, which should have been 37\u00b0 19\u2019 50\u201c,24 we know that the sextant reads 2\u00bd minutes high. Therefore, the corrected distance of Mars from the tail of Ursa was 52\u00b0 19\u00bd\u2019. And since the latitude of the fixed star is 56\u00b0 22\u2019, the remainder, by subtraction, is 4\u00b0 2\u00bd\u2019\u2014supposing that Mars was at precisely the same longitude as the fixed star. But because there was a difference of 3\u00be degrees between them (as is clear from the following observations), a slight correction is required.\n For let AB be 3\u00b0 43\u2019 30\u201c on a parallel close to the ecliptic, B Mars, C the fixed star, and BC 52\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c. Dividing the secant of BC by the secant of AB gives the  secant of CA, 52\u00b0 14\u2019, which, subtracted from 56\u00b0 22\u2019 (the latitude of the fixed star) leaves 4\u00b0 8\u2019 north as Mars\u2019s observed latitude. At the same time, we found 19\u00b0 23\u2019 between Mars and Cor Leonis (19\u00b0 20\u00bd corrected), and 21\u00b0 20\u2019 between Mars and the bright star in the wing of Virgo25 (21\u00b0 17\u00bd\u2019 corrected). From these two distances (using the latitudes of the stars and Mars), Mars\u2019s longitude is found to be 13\u00b0 19\u2019 6\u201c Virgo, by consensus of all measurements.\nAlternatively, the meridian altitude of Mars was found at 12h 40m, using two quadrants, to be 50\u00b0 19\u2019, while the tail of Leo26 was 56\u00b0 45\u2019. Therefore, from the declinations and right ascensions of the fixed stars and our distances, Mars\u2019s position is determined as 13\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c Virgo, latitude 4\u00b0 7\u2019 55\u201c ^27. This is the Tychonic procedure. I have included the other for the sake of showing a consensus, and also that it might be evident that despite the lack of absolute perfection in the demonstration, short cuts either in computation or in our understanding can under certain circumstances be applied. For in that previous procedure there is less in the actual work than in the reporting of it. At Prague, 5\u00b0 Scorpio was rising ^28. Therefore, the nonagesimal was about 32\u00bd\u00b0 from the zenith. And since Mars\u2019s distance from the earth was rather more than half the sun\u2019s distance, the resulting parallax of about 5\u2019 opposite 32\u00bd\u00b0 in our parallactic table, shows a latitudinal parallax of 2\u2019 41\u201c. Thus the latitude as seen from the middle of the earth would be 4\u00b0 10\u2154\u2019 north. And because the altitude of the nonagesimal was 57\u00bd\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax at the horizon was 4\u2019 13\u201c. But since Mars was 38\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, the longitudinal parallax corresponding to this position is 2\u2019 36\u201c, and if this be eliminated, Mars would be placed at about 13\u00b0 18\u2019 Virgo ^29. At that moment, the sun\u2019s position was 10\u00b0 16\u2019 42\u201c Pisces. The distance between the bodies was 3\u00b0 1\u2019 18\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 4\u201c, and that of Mars, 24\u2019 5\u201c (for it was 24\u2019 18\u201c at 21\u00b0 Leo in 1585, and 24\u2019 at 26 Virgo in 1587). The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 24\u2019 9\u201c. The true opposition therefore followed 2 days 3 hours 43 minutes later, on 21 February\/3 March before dawn at 2h 13m, Mars being at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 35\u201c Virgo. Forty seconds must be subtracted to reduce the position to the orbit, putting Mars at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 Virgo, with slightly less latitude than before, since the latitude was then decreasing. It was therefore about 4\u00b0 10\u2019, or 4\u00b0 7\u2153\u2019 if the parallax be neglected.\n But because, since Tycho\u2019s death, we have not made frequent observations nor continued them over several days, it would be best, for certainty\u2019s sake, also to make use of those observations which David Fabricius of East Frisia, a sedulous practitioner of astronomy, has communicated to me.\nOn February 16, old style, at 5h in the morning, he took the planet\u2019s distances from the tail of Leo (for the latitude), from the neck of Leo,30 and, on the other hand, from the bright star in the southern wing of Virgo, so as to check its longitude by working it out twice.\nI could make use of Tycho\u2019s line of reasoning, which he routinely adopted in volume I of the Progymnasmata when (as here) the declination of the planet was not known. But because that method extends to ten operations, I prefer for the sake of brevity to proceed as I did before with my own observations. Here there are no hidden dangers.\nFirst, the star in the wing of Virgo, adjusted to our time, is at 4\u00b0 36\u2019 30\u201c Libra with latitude 2\u00b0 50\u2019 north. Fabricius found that Mars is 20\u00b0 18\u2019 westward from it on the zodiac, which puts Mars at about 14\u00b0 18\u2019 30\u201c Virgo. This is a preliminary, approximate figure: the longitude will shortly be corrected. Now the tail of Leo31 is at 16\u00b0 4\u2019 Virgo, with latitude 12\u00b0 18\u2019 North, and Mars was found to be 8\u00b0 17\u2019 distant from the Tail. What is sought is the distance of its parallel from the Tail, since the difference in longitude is 1\u00b0 45\u2019. Dividing the secant of 8\u00b0 17\u2019 by the secant of 1\u00b0 45\u2019 gives the secant of 8\u00b0 6\u2019, the arc sought. This subtracted from the fixed star\u2019s northern latitude of 12\u00b0 18\u2019 leaves Mars\u2019s latitude, 4\u00b0 12\u2019 north. This I now take as determined, and compare it with the latitudes of the fixed stars according to the laws of trigonometry. From the Wing of Virgo, I find Mars\u2019s longitude to be 14\u00b0 19\u2019 Virgo; from the Neck of Leo, 14\u00b0 23\u2019 36\u201c. The mean of these two is 14\u00b0 21\u2019 18\u201c Virgo. And since the sextant gave distances larger than the truth, the latitude would come out at 4\u00b0 14\u2019 north.\nOn the night following February 23, at 12h, he observed Mars in relation to five fixed stars: the Tail of Leo and Arcturus for latitude, and for the longitude, in the first instance, Spica (which followed it), and, in the second, the Neck of Leo and Cor Leonis (which preceded it).\nBy a rough estimate, I foresee that Mars is going to fall at 11\u00bc\u00b0 Virgo. It was found to be 9\u00b0 24\u2019 from the Tail of Leo, and hence, its latitude comes out at 4\u00b0 6\u2019 ^32. And now, through this and the latitudes of the fixed stars, together with their distances (17\u00b0 26\u2019 from Regulus, 17\u00b0 51\u2019 from the Neck of Leo, 37\u00b0 28\u2019 from Spica, 44\u00b0 15\u2019 from Arcturus), Mars\u2019s position comes out at 11\u00b0 21\u2019 23\u201c Virgo (from Regulus), 11\u00b0 20\u2019 52\u201c Virgo (from the Neck of Leo), and 11\u00b0 17\u2019 40\u201c (from Spica). Again (as you see) the distances err in being too great. For from the Heart and the Neck [of Leo], Mars is pushed a little eastward, and from Spica and Arcturus a little westward, and more from Arcturus, owing to its greater northern latitude ^33. The mean (ignoring Arcturus), 11\u00b0 19\u2019 20\u201c Virgo, is very nearly true. Also, the latitude is greater, namely, 4\u00b0 7\u2019 40\u201c north. Now from February 15 at 17h to 23 February at 12h, a period of 7 days 19 hours, Mars moved 3\u00b0 0\u2019: 180 minutes in 187 hours. That is, about one minute per hour. And if you wish to take it into account, the parallax (if any) is subtracted from the longitude on February 16 and a little is added on February 23.\n Because the last observation follows the time of observation found by me by 2 days 21 hours 47 min., add the motion corresponding to this time, 1\u00b0 7\u2019: the position will come out 12\u00b0 26\u2019 Virgo. The agreement is thus very good\u2014it could not be better\u2014given that both of us [that is, Kepler and Fabricius] work independently and do not rely on the facilities used by Tycho Brahe.","1685":"VIII. On 1595 October 30 at 8h 20m, the planet was found at 17\u00b0 47\u2019 15\u201c Taurus,19 not far from the nonagesimal. We may thus be sure of the parallax, although we must take it into account. The latitude was 0\u00b0 5\u2019 10\u201c north. The sun\u2019s position was 16\u00b0 50\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio. The distance between the stars was 56\u2019 45\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 35\u201c; that of Mars, 22\u2019 54\u201c, as appears by comparing the nearby observations. The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 23\u2019 29\u201c. If the distance between the stars be divided by this, it comes out to 40\u2019 47\u201c of a day, or 16 hours 19 min. Therefore, the true opposition was 0h 39m PM on October 31. Mars\u2019s position was 17\u00b0 31\u2019 40\u201c Taurus. This needs no reduction to the orbit, as it is nearly at the node. The latitude was about 0\u00b0 8\u2019 north. But comparison with the preceding and following days shows a latitude of about 5\u2019 north.\nIX. Let, at any rate, Mars\u2019s position on 1597 December 10 at 8h 30m be 3\u00b0 45\u00bd\u2019 Cancer (as above) ^20. The sun\u2019s position was 29\u00b0 4\u2019 53\u201c Sagittarius. The distance between the stars was 4\u00b0 40\u2019 37\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 61\u2019 20\u201c, that of Mars 23\u2019 40\u201c (for in 1580 the diurnal motion in Gemini was 23\u2019, and in 1582, at 17\u00b0 Cancer, it was 24\u2019). Therefore, the sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 25\u2019 0\u201c. These data show that the time of true opposition followed 3 days 7 hours 14 min. later, on December 14 at 3h 44m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 2\u00b0 27\u2153\u2019 Cancer. The reduction to the orbit (quite ridiculous here, since the observation itself has an uncertainty of several minutes) requires the addition of about 52\u201c. Therefore, the corrected position was 2\u00b0 28\u2019 Cancer. The latitude, from the table, was 3\u00b0 33\u2019 north.\nOn the same night, the one following December 10, at 12\u2159h, Fabricius in East Frisia found Mars\u2019s position to be 3\u00b0 40\u00bc\u2019 Cancer with latitude 3\u00b0 23\u2019 N. In this observation the longitude comes out nearly the same. For the motion over 3h 40m is 3\u00bd\u2019, so that in the Brahean observation too, at 12\u2159h Mars could have been at 3\u00b0 42\u2019 Cancer\u2014two minutes beyond the Fabrician position.\nX. On 1600 January 13\/23 at 11h 40m, the time being adjusted to Uraniborg time, the planet was observed at 10\u00b0 38\u2019 46\u201c Leo ^21. The sun\u2019s position was 3\u00b0 26\u2019 30\u201c Aquarius. The stars were 7\u00b0 12\u2019 16\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion for the next few days was 1\u00b0 1\u2019 3\u201c; that of Mars, 23\u2019 44\u201c. The sum: 1\u00b0 24\u2019 47\u201c. The opposition therefore followed 5 days 2h 22m after; that is, on January 19\/29 at 2h 2m in the morning, before dawn. Mars was at 8\u00b0 38\u2019 Leo. There is no need for reduction, since it is near the limit. The latitude, from the table, was 4\u00b0 30\u2019 50\u201c N.\nXI. On the evening of 1602 Febr. 18\/28 at 10h 30m, using the Tychonic  instruments (with the help of the learned Matthias Seiffard,22 bequeathed us by Tycho), I took the distance of Mars from the middle star of the tail of Ursa Major 23 to be 52\u00b0 22\u2019. And since the distance between Cor Leonis and Procyon was 37\u00b0 22\u2019 20\u201c, which should have been 37\u00b0 19\u2019 50\u201c,24 we know that the sextant reads 2\u00bd minutes high. Therefore, the corrected distance of Mars from the tail of Ursa was 52\u00b0 19\u00bd\u2019. And since the latitude of the fixed star is 56\u00b0 22\u2019, the remainder, by subtraction, is 4\u00b0 2\u00bd\u2019\u2014supposing that Mars was at precisely the same longitude as the fixed star. But because there was a difference of 3\u00be degrees between them (as is clear from the following observations), a slight correction is required.\n For let AB be 3\u00b0 43\u2019 30\u201c on a parallel close to the ecliptic, B Mars, C the fixed star, and BC 52\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c. Dividing the secant of BC by the secant of AB gives the  secant of CA, 52\u00b0 14\u2019, which, subtracted from 56\u00b0 22\u2019 (the latitude of the fixed star) leaves 4\u00b0 8\u2019 north as Mars\u2019s observed latitude. At the same time, we found 19\u00b0 23\u2019 between Mars and Cor Leonis (19\u00b0 20\u00bd corrected), and 21\u00b0 20\u2019 between Mars and the bright star in the wing of Virgo25 (21\u00b0 17\u00bd\u2019 corrected). From these two distances (using the latitudes of the stars and Mars), Mars\u2019s longitude is found to be 13\u00b0 19\u2019 6\u201c Virgo, by consensus of all measurements.\nAlternatively, the meridian altitude of Mars was found at 12h 40m, using two quadrants, to be 50\u00b0 19\u2019, while the tail of Leo26 was 56\u00b0 45\u2019. Therefore, from the declinations and right ascensions of the fixed stars and our distances, Mars\u2019s position is determined as 13\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c Virgo, latitude 4\u00b0 7\u2019 55\u201c ^27. This is the Tychonic procedure. I have included the other for the sake of showing a consensus, and also that it might be evident that despite the lack of absolute perfection in the demonstration, short cuts either in computation or in our understanding can under certain circumstances be applied. For in that previous procedure there is less in the actual work than in the reporting of it. At Prague, 5\u00b0 Scorpio was rising ^28. Therefore, the nonagesimal was about 32\u00bd\u00b0 from the zenith. And since Mars\u2019s distance from the earth was rather more than half the sun\u2019s distance, the resulting parallax of about 5\u2019 opposite 32\u00bd\u00b0 in our parallactic table, shows a latitudinal parallax of 2\u2019 41\u201c. Thus the latitude as seen from the middle of the earth would be 4\u00b0 10\u2154\u2019 north. And because the altitude of the nonagesimal was 57\u00bd\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax at the horizon was 4\u2019 13\u201c. But since Mars was 38\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, the longitudinal parallax corresponding to this position is 2\u2019 36\u201c, and if this be eliminated, Mars would be placed at about 13\u00b0 18\u2019 Virgo ^29. At that moment, the sun\u2019s position was 10\u00b0 16\u2019 42\u201c Pisces. The distance between the bodies was 3\u00b0 1\u2019 18\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 4\u201c, and that of Mars, 24\u2019 5\u201c (for it was 24\u2019 18\u201c at 21\u00b0 Leo in 1585, and 24\u2019 at 26 Virgo in 1587). The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 24\u2019 9\u201c. The true opposition therefore followed 2 days 3 hours 43 minutes later, on 21 February\/3 March before dawn at 2h 13m, Mars being at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 35\u201c Virgo. Forty seconds must be subtracted to reduce the position to the orbit, putting Mars at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 Virgo, with slightly less latitude than before, since the latitude was then decreasing. It was therefore about 4\u00b0 10\u2019, or 4\u00b0 7\u2153\u2019 if the parallax be neglected.\n But because, since Tycho\u2019s death, we have not made frequent observations nor continued them over several days, it would be best, for certainty\u2019s sake, also to make use of those observations which David Fabricius of East Frisia, a sedulous practitioner of astronomy, has communicated to me.\nOn February 16, old style, at 5h in the morning, he took the planet\u2019s distances from the tail of Leo (for the latitude), from the neck of Leo,30 and, on the other hand, from the bright star in the southern wing of Virgo, so as to check its longitude by working it out twice.\nI could make use of Tycho\u2019s line of reasoning, which he routinely adopted in volume I of the Progymnasmata when (as here) the declination of the planet was not known. But because that method extends to ten operations, I prefer for the sake of brevity to proceed as I did before with my own observations. Here there are no hidden dangers.\nFirst, the star in the wing of Virgo, adjusted to our time, is at 4\u00b0 36\u2019 30\u201c Libra with latitude 2\u00b0 50\u2019 north. Fabricius found that Mars is 20\u00b0 18\u2019 westward from it on the zodiac, which puts Mars at about 14\u00b0 18\u2019 30\u201c Virgo. This is a preliminary, approximate figure: the longitude will shortly be corrected. Now the tail of Leo31 is at 16\u00b0 4\u2019 Virgo, with latitude 12\u00b0 18\u2019 North, and Mars was found to be 8\u00b0 17\u2019 distant from the Tail. What is sought is the distance of its parallel from the Tail, since the difference in longitude is 1\u00b0 45\u2019. Dividing the secant of 8\u00b0 17\u2019 by the secant of 1\u00b0 45\u2019 gives the secant of 8\u00b0 6\u2019, the arc sought. This subtracted from the fixed star\u2019s northern latitude of 12\u00b0 18\u2019 leaves Mars\u2019s latitude, 4\u00b0 12\u2019 north. This I now take as determined, and compare it with the latitudes of the fixed stars according to the laws of trigonometry. From the Wing of Virgo, I find Mars\u2019s longitude to be 14\u00b0 19\u2019 Virgo; from the Neck of Leo, 14\u00b0 23\u2019 36\u201c. The mean of these two is 14\u00b0 21\u2019 18\u201c Virgo. And since the sextant gave distances larger than the truth, the latitude would come out at 4\u00b0 14\u2019 north.\nOn the night following February 23, at 12h, he observed Mars in relation to five fixed stars: the Tail of Leo and Arcturus for latitude, and for the longitude, in the first instance, Spica (which followed it), and, in the second, the Neck of Leo and Cor Leonis (which preceded it).\nBy a rough estimate, I foresee that Mars is going to fall at 11\u00bc\u00b0 Virgo. It was found to be 9\u00b0 24\u2019 from the Tail of Leo, and hence, its latitude comes out at 4\u00b0 6\u2019 ^32. And now, through this and the latitudes of the fixed stars, together with their distances (17\u00b0 26\u2019 from Regulus, 17\u00b0 51\u2019 from the Neck of Leo, 37\u00b0 28\u2019 from Spica, 44\u00b0 15\u2019 from Arcturus), Mars\u2019s position comes out at 11\u00b0 21\u2019 23\u201c Virgo (from Regulus), 11\u00b0 20\u2019 52\u201c Virgo (from the Neck of Leo), and 11\u00b0 17\u2019 40\u201c (from Spica). Again (as you see) the distances err in being too great. For from the Heart and the Neck [of Leo], Mars is pushed a little eastward, and from Spica and Arcturus a little westward, and more from Arcturus, owing to its greater northern latitude ^33. The mean (ignoring Arcturus), 11\u00b0 19\u2019 20\u201c Virgo, is very nearly true. Also, the latitude is greater, namely, 4\u00b0 7\u2019 40\u201c north. Now from February 15 at 17h to 23 February at 12h, a period of 7 days 19 hours, Mars moved 3\u00b0 0\u2019: 180 minutes in 187 hours. That is, about one minute per hour. And if you wish to take it into account, the parallax (if any) is subtracted from the longitude on February 16 and a little is added on February 23.\n Because the last observation follows the time of observation found by me by 2 days 21 hours 47 min., add the motion corresponding to this time, 1\u00b0 7\u2019: the position will come out 12\u00b0 26\u2019 Virgo. The agreement is thus very good\u2014it could not be better\u2014given that both of us [that is, Kepler and Fabricius] work independently and do not rely on the facilities used by Tycho Brahe.","1686":"VIII. On 1595 October 30 at 8h 20m, the planet was found at 17\u00b0 47\u2019 15\u201c Taurus,19 not far from the nonagesimal. We may thus be sure of the parallax, although we must take it into account. The latitude was 0\u00b0 5\u2019 10\u201c north. The sun\u2019s position was 16\u00b0 50\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio. The distance between the stars was 56\u2019 45\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 35\u201c; that of Mars, 22\u2019 54\u201c, as appears by comparing the nearby observations. The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 23\u2019 29\u201c. If the distance between the stars be divided by this, it comes out to 40\u2019 47\u201c of a day, or 16 hours 19 min. Therefore, the true opposition was 0h 39m PM on October 31. Mars\u2019s position was 17\u00b0 31\u2019 40\u201c Taurus. This needs no reduction to the orbit, as it is nearly at the node. The latitude was about 0\u00b0 8\u2019 north. But comparison with the preceding and following days shows a latitude of about 5\u2019 north.\nIX. Let, at any rate, Mars\u2019s position on 1597 December 10 at 8h 30m be 3\u00b0 45\u00bd\u2019 Cancer (as above) ^20. The sun\u2019s position was 29\u00b0 4\u2019 53\u201c Sagittarius. The distance between the stars was 4\u00b0 40\u2019 37\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 61\u2019 20\u201c, that of Mars 23\u2019 40\u201c (for in 1580 the diurnal motion in Gemini was 23\u2019, and in 1582, at 17\u00b0 Cancer, it was 24\u2019). Therefore, the sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 25\u2019 0\u201c. These data show that the time of true opposition followed 3 days 7 hours 14 min. later, on December 14 at 3h 44m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 2\u00b0 27\u2153\u2019 Cancer. The reduction to the orbit (quite ridiculous here, since the observation itself has an uncertainty of several minutes) requires the addition of about 52\u201c. Therefore, the corrected position was 2\u00b0 28\u2019 Cancer. The latitude, from the table, was 3\u00b0 33\u2019 north.\nOn the same night, the one following December 10, at 12\u2159h, Fabricius in East Frisia found Mars\u2019s position to be 3\u00b0 40\u00bc\u2019 Cancer with latitude 3\u00b0 23\u2019 N. In this observation the longitude comes out nearly the same. For the motion over 3h 40m is 3\u00bd\u2019, so that in the Brahean observation too, at 12\u2159h Mars could have been at 3\u00b0 42\u2019 Cancer\u2014two minutes beyond the Fabrician position.\nX. On 1600 January 13\/23 at 11h 40m, the time being adjusted to Uraniborg time, the planet was observed at 10\u00b0 38\u2019 46\u201c Leo ^21. The sun\u2019s position was 3\u00b0 26\u2019 30\u201c Aquarius. The stars were 7\u00b0 12\u2019 16\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion for the next few days was 1\u00b0 1\u2019 3\u201c; that of Mars, 23\u2019 44\u201c. The sum: 1\u00b0 24\u2019 47\u201c. The opposition therefore followed 5 days 2h 22m after; that is, on January 19\/29 at 2h 2m in the morning, before dawn. Mars was at 8\u00b0 38\u2019 Leo. There is no need for reduction, since it is near the limit. The latitude, from the table, was 4\u00b0 30\u2019 50\u201c N.\nXI. On the evening of 1602 Febr. 18\/28 at 10h 30m, using the Tychonic  instruments (with the help of the learned Matthias Seiffard,22 bequeathed us by Tycho), I took the distance of Mars from the middle star of the tail of Ursa Major 23 to be 52\u00b0 22\u2019. And since the distance between Cor Leonis and Procyon was 37\u00b0 22\u2019 20\u201c, which should have been 37\u00b0 19\u2019 50\u201c,24 we know that the sextant reads 2\u00bd minutes high. Therefore, the corrected distance of Mars from the tail of Ursa was 52\u00b0 19\u00bd\u2019. And since the latitude of the fixed star is 56\u00b0 22\u2019, the remainder, by subtraction, is 4\u00b0 2\u00bd\u2019\u2014supposing that Mars was at precisely the same longitude as the fixed star. But because there was a difference of 3\u00be degrees between them (as is clear from the following observations), a slight correction is required.\n For let AB be 3\u00b0 43\u2019 30\u201c on a parallel close to the ecliptic, B Mars, C the fixed star, and BC 52\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c. Dividing the secant of BC by the secant of AB gives the  secant of CA, 52\u00b0 14\u2019, which, subtracted from 56\u00b0 22\u2019 (the latitude of the fixed star) leaves 4\u00b0 8\u2019 north as Mars\u2019s observed latitude. At the same time, we found 19\u00b0 23\u2019 between Mars and Cor Leonis (19\u00b0 20\u00bd corrected), and 21\u00b0 20\u2019 between Mars and the bright star in the wing of Virgo25 (21\u00b0 17\u00bd\u2019 corrected). From these two distances (using the latitudes of the stars and Mars), Mars\u2019s longitude is found to be 13\u00b0 19\u2019 6\u201c Virgo, by consensus of all measurements.\nAlternatively, the meridian altitude of Mars was found at 12h 40m, using two quadrants, to be 50\u00b0 19\u2019, while the tail of Leo26 was 56\u00b0 45\u2019. Therefore, from the declinations and right ascensions of the fixed stars and our distances, Mars\u2019s position is determined as 13\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c Virgo, latitude 4\u00b0 7\u2019 55\u201c ^27. This is the Tychonic procedure. I have included the other for the sake of showing a consensus, and also that it might be evident that despite the lack of absolute perfection in the demonstration, short cuts either in computation or in our understanding can under certain circumstances be applied. For in that previous procedure there is less in the actual work than in the reporting of it. At Prague, 5\u00b0 Scorpio was rising ^28. Therefore, the nonagesimal was about 32\u00bd\u00b0 from the zenith. And since Mars\u2019s distance from the earth was rather more than half the sun\u2019s distance, the resulting parallax of about 5\u2019 opposite 32\u00bd\u00b0 in our parallactic table, shows a latitudinal parallax of 2\u2019 41\u201c. Thus the latitude as seen from the middle of the earth would be 4\u00b0 10\u2154\u2019 north. And because the altitude of the nonagesimal was 57\u00bd\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax at the horizon was 4\u2019 13\u201c. But since Mars was 38\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, the longitudinal parallax corresponding to this position is 2\u2019 36\u201c, and if this be eliminated, Mars would be placed at about 13\u00b0 18\u2019 Virgo ^29. At that moment, the sun\u2019s position was 10\u00b0 16\u2019 42\u201c Pisces. The distance between the bodies was 3\u00b0 1\u2019 18\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 4\u201c, and that of Mars, 24\u2019 5\u201c (for it was 24\u2019 18\u201c at 21\u00b0 Leo in 1585, and 24\u2019 at 26 Virgo in 1587). The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 24\u2019 9\u201c. The true opposition therefore followed 2 days 3 hours 43 minutes later, on 21 February\/3 March before dawn at 2h 13m, Mars being at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 35\u201c Virgo. Forty seconds must be subtracted to reduce the position to the orbit, putting Mars at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 Virgo, with slightly less latitude than before, since the latitude was then decreasing. It was therefore about 4\u00b0 10\u2019, or 4\u00b0 7\u2153\u2019 if the parallax be neglected.\n But because, since Tycho\u2019s death, we have not made frequent observations nor continued them over several days, it would be best, for certainty\u2019s sake, also to make use of those observations which David Fabricius of East Frisia, a sedulous practitioner of astronomy, has communicated to me.\nOn February 16, old style, at 5h in the morning, he took the planet\u2019s distances from the tail of Leo (for the latitude), from the neck of Leo,30 and, on the other hand, from the bright star in the southern wing of Virgo, so as to check its longitude by working it out twice.\nI could make use of Tycho\u2019s line of reasoning, which he routinely adopted in volume I of the Progymnasmata when (as here) the declination of the planet was not known. But because that method extends to ten operations, I prefer for the sake of brevity to proceed as I did before with my own observations. Here there are no hidden dangers.\nFirst, the star in the wing of Virgo, adjusted to our time, is at 4\u00b0 36\u2019 30\u201c Libra with latitude 2\u00b0 50\u2019 north. Fabricius found that Mars is 20\u00b0 18\u2019 westward from it on the zodiac, which puts Mars at about 14\u00b0 18\u2019 30\u201c Virgo. This is a preliminary, approximate figure: the longitude will shortly be corrected. Now the tail of Leo31 is at 16\u00b0 4\u2019 Virgo, with latitude 12\u00b0 18\u2019 North, and Mars was found to be 8\u00b0 17\u2019 distant from the Tail. What is sought is the distance of its parallel from the Tail, since the difference in longitude is 1\u00b0 45\u2019. Dividing the secant of 8\u00b0 17\u2019 by the secant of 1\u00b0 45\u2019 gives the secant of 8\u00b0 6\u2019, the arc sought. This subtracted from the fixed star\u2019s northern latitude of 12\u00b0 18\u2019 leaves Mars\u2019s latitude, 4\u00b0 12\u2019 north. This I now take as determined, and compare it with the latitudes of the fixed stars according to the laws of trigonometry. From the Wing of Virgo, I find Mars\u2019s longitude to be 14\u00b0 19\u2019 Virgo; from the Neck of Leo, 14\u00b0 23\u2019 36\u201c. The mean of these two is 14\u00b0 21\u2019 18\u201c Virgo. And since the sextant gave distances larger than the truth, the latitude would come out at 4\u00b0 14\u2019 north.\nOn the night following February 23, at 12h, he observed Mars in relation to five fixed stars: the Tail of Leo and Arcturus for latitude, and for the longitude, in the first instance, Spica (which followed it), and, in the second, the Neck of Leo and Cor Leonis (which preceded it).\nBy a rough estimate, I foresee that Mars is going to fall at 11\u00bc\u00b0 Virgo. It was found to be 9\u00b0 24\u2019 from the Tail of Leo, and hence, its latitude comes out at 4\u00b0 6\u2019 ^32. And now, through this and the latitudes of the fixed stars, together with their distances (17\u00b0 26\u2019 from Regulus, 17\u00b0 51\u2019 from the Neck of Leo, 37\u00b0 28\u2019 from Spica, 44\u00b0 15\u2019 from Arcturus), Mars\u2019s position comes out at 11\u00b0 21\u2019 23\u201c Virgo (from Regulus), 11\u00b0 20\u2019 52\u201c Virgo (from the Neck of Leo), and 11\u00b0 17\u2019 40\u201c (from Spica). Again (as you see) the distances err in being too great. For from the Heart and the Neck [of Leo], Mars is pushed a little eastward, and from Spica and Arcturus a little westward, and more from Arcturus, owing to its greater northern latitude ^33. The mean (ignoring Arcturus), 11\u00b0 19\u2019 20\u201c Virgo, is very nearly true. Also, the latitude is greater, namely, 4\u00b0 7\u2019 40\u201c north. Now from February 15 at 17h to 23 February at 12h, a period of 7 days 19 hours, Mars moved 3\u00b0 0\u2019: 180 minutes in 187 hours. That is, about one minute per hour. And if you wish to take it into account, the parallax (if any) is subtracted from the longitude on February 16 and a little is added on February 23.\n Because the last observation follows the time of observation found by me by 2 days 21 hours 47 min., add the motion corresponding to this time, 1\u00b0 7\u2019: the position will come out 12\u00b0 26\u2019 Virgo. The agreement is thus very good\u2014it could not be better\u2014given that both of us [that is, Kepler and Fabricius] work independently and do not rely on the facilities used by Tycho Brahe.","1687":"VIII. On 1595 October 30 at 8h 20m, the planet was found at 17\u00b0 47\u2019 15\u201c Taurus,19 not far from the nonagesimal. We may thus be sure of the parallax, although we must take it into account. The latitude was 0\u00b0 5\u2019 10\u201c north. The sun\u2019s position was 16\u00b0 50\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio. The distance between the stars was 56\u2019 45\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 35\u201c; that of Mars, 22\u2019 54\u201c, as appears by comparing the nearby observations. The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 23\u2019 29\u201c. If the distance between the stars be divided by this, it comes out to 40\u2019 47\u201c of a day, or 16 hours 19 min. Therefore, the true opposition was 0h 39m PM on October 31. Mars\u2019s position was 17\u00b0 31\u2019 40\u201c Taurus. This needs no reduction to the orbit, as it is nearly at the node. The latitude was about 0\u00b0 8\u2019 north. But comparison with the preceding and following days shows a latitude of about 5\u2019 north.\nIX. Let, at any rate, Mars\u2019s position on 1597 December 10 at 8h 30m be 3\u00b0 45\u00bd\u2019 Cancer (as above) ^20. The sun\u2019s position was 29\u00b0 4\u2019 53\u201c Sagittarius. The distance between the stars was 4\u00b0 40\u2019 37\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 61\u2019 20\u201c, that of Mars 23\u2019 40\u201c (for in 1580 the diurnal motion in Gemini was 23\u2019, and in 1582, at 17\u00b0 Cancer, it was 24\u2019). Therefore, the sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 25\u2019 0\u201c. These data show that the time of true opposition followed 3 days 7 hours 14 min. later, on December 14 at 3h 44m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 2\u00b0 27\u2153\u2019 Cancer. The reduction to the orbit (quite ridiculous here, since the observation itself has an uncertainty of several minutes) requires the addition of about 52\u201c. Therefore, the corrected position was 2\u00b0 28\u2019 Cancer. The latitude, from the table, was 3\u00b0 33\u2019 north.\nOn the same night, the one following December 10, at 12\u2159h, Fabricius in East Frisia found Mars\u2019s position to be 3\u00b0 40\u00bc\u2019 Cancer with latitude 3\u00b0 23\u2019 N. In this observation the longitude comes out nearly the same. For the motion over 3h 40m is 3\u00bd\u2019, so that in the Brahean observation too, at 12\u2159h Mars could have been at 3\u00b0 42\u2019 Cancer\u2014two minutes beyond the Fabrician position.\nX. On 1600 January 13\/23 at 11h 40m, the time being adjusted to Uraniborg time, the planet was observed at 10\u00b0 38\u2019 46\u201c Leo ^21. The sun\u2019s position was 3\u00b0 26\u2019 30\u201c Aquarius. The stars were 7\u00b0 12\u2019 16\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion for the next few days was 1\u00b0 1\u2019 3\u201c; that of Mars, 23\u2019 44\u201c. The sum: 1\u00b0 24\u2019 47\u201c. The opposition therefore followed 5 days 2h 22m after; that is, on January 19\/29 at 2h 2m in the morning, before dawn. Mars was at 8\u00b0 38\u2019 Leo. There is no need for reduction, since it is near the limit. The latitude, from the table, was 4\u00b0 30\u2019 50\u201c N.\nXI. On the evening of 1602 Febr. 18\/28 at 10h 30m, using the Tychonic  instruments (with the help of the learned Matthias Seiffard,22 bequeathed us by Tycho), I took the distance of Mars from the middle star of the tail of Ursa Major 23 to be 52\u00b0 22\u2019. And since the distance between Cor Leonis and Procyon was 37\u00b0 22\u2019 20\u201c, which should have been 37\u00b0 19\u2019 50\u201c,24 we know that the sextant reads 2\u00bd minutes high. Therefore, the corrected distance of Mars from the tail of Ursa was 52\u00b0 19\u00bd\u2019. And since the latitude of the fixed star is 56\u00b0 22\u2019, the remainder, by subtraction, is 4\u00b0 2\u00bd\u2019\u2014supposing that Mars was at precisely the same longitude as the fixed star. But because there was a difference of 3\u00be degrees between them (as is clear from the following observations), a slight correction is required.\n For let AB be 3\u00b0 43\u2019 30\u201c on a parallel close to the ecliptic, B Mars, C the fixed star, and BC 52\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c. Dividing the secant of BC by the secant of AB gives the  secant of CA, 52\u00b0 14\u2019, which, subtracted from 56\u00b0 22\u2019 (the latitude of the fixed star) leaves 4\u00b0 8\u2019 north as Mars\u2019s observed latitude. At the same time, we found 19\u00b0 23\u2019 between Mars and Cor Leonis (19\u00b0 20\u00bd corrected), and 21\u00b0 20\u2019 between Mars and the bright star in the wing of Virgo25 (21\u00b0 17\u00bd\u2019 corrected). From these two distances (using the latitudes of the stars and Mars), Mars\u2019s longitude is found to be 13\u00b0 19\u2019 6\u201c Virgo, by consensus of all measurements.\nAlternatively, the meridian altitude of Mars was found at 12h 40m, using two quadrants, to be 50\u00b0 19\u2019, while the tail of Leo26 was 56\u00b0 45\u2019. Therefore, from the declinations and right ascensions of the fixed stars and our distances, Mars\u2019s position is determined as 13\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c Virgo, latitude 4\u00b0 7\u2019 55\u201c ^27. This is the Tychonic procedure. I have included the other for the sake of showing a consensus, and also that it might be evident that despite the lack of absolute perfection in the demonstration, short cuts either in computation or in our understanding can under certain circumstances be applied. For in that previous procedure there is less in the actual work than in the reporting of it. At Prague, 5\u00b0 Scorpio was rising ^28. Therefore, the nonagesimal was about 32\u00bd\u00b0 from the zenith. And since Mars\u2019s distance from the earth was rather more than half the sun\u2019s distance, the resulting parallax of about 5\u2019 opposite 32\u00bd\u00b0 in our parallactic table, shows a latitudinal parallax of 2\u2019 41\u201c. Thus the latitude as seen from the middle of the earth would be 4\u00b0 10\u2154\u2019 north. And because the altitude of the nonagesimal was 57\u00bd\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax at the horizon was 4\u2019 13\u201c. But since Mars was 38\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, the longitudinal parallax corresponding to this position is 2\u2019 36\u201c, and if this be eliminated, Mars would be placed at about 13\u00b0 18\u2019 Virgo ^29. At that moment, the sun\u2019s position was 10\u00b0 16\u2019 42\u201c Pisces. The distance between the bodies was 3\u00b0 1\u2019 18\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 4\u201c, and that of Mars, 24\u2019 5\u201c (for it was 24\u2019 18\u201c at 21\u00b0 Leo in 1585, and 24\u2019 at 26 Virgo in 1587). The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 24\u2019 9\u201c. The true opposition therefore followed 2 days 3 hours 43 minutes later, on 21 February\/3 March before dawn at 2h 13m, Mars being at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 35\u201c Virgo. Forty seconds must be subtracted to reduce the position to the orbit, putting Mars at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 Virgo, with slightly less latitude than before, since the latitude was then decreasing. It was therefore about 4\u00b0 10\u2019, or 4\u00b0 7\u2153\u2019 if the parallax be neglected.\n But because, since Tycho\u2019s death, we have not made frequent observations nor continued them over several days, it would be best, for certainty\u2019s sake, also to make use of those observations which David Fabricius of East Frisia, a sedulous practitioner of astronomy, has communicated to me.\nOn February 16, old style, at 5h in the morning, he took the planet\u2019s distances from the tail of Leo (for the latitude), from the neck of Leo,30 and, on the other hand, from the bright star in the southern wing of Virgo, so as to check its longitude by working it out twice.\nI could make use of Tycho\u2019s line of reasoning, which he routinely adopted in volume I of the Progymnasmata when (as here) the declination of the planet was not known. But because that method extends to ten operations, I prefer for the sake of brevity to proceed as I did before with my own observations. Here there are no hidden dangers.\nFirst, the star in the wing of Virgo, adjusted to our time, is at 4\u00b0 36\u2019 30\u201c Libra with latitude 2\u00b0 50\u2019 north. Fabricius found that Mars is 20\u00b0 18\u2019 westward from it on the zodiac, which puts Mars at about 14\u00b0 18\u2019 30\u201c Virgo. This is a preliminary, approximate figure: the longitude will shortly be corrected. Now the tail of Leo31 is at 16\u00b0 4\u2019 Virgo, with latitude 12\u00b0 18\u2019 North, and Mars was found to be 8\u00b0 17\u2019 distant from the Tail. What is sought is the distance of its parallel from the Tail, since the difference in longitude is 1\u00b0 45\u2019. Dividing the secant of 8\u00b0 17\u2019 by the secant of 1\u00b0 45\u2019 gives the secant of 8\u00b0 6\u2019, the arc sought. This subtracted from the fixed star\u2019s northern latitude of 12\u00b0 18\u2019 leaves Mars\u2019s latitude, 4\u00b0 12\u2019 north. This I now take as determined, and compare it with the latitudes of the fixed stars according to the laws of trigonometry. From the Wing of Virgo, I find Mars\u2019s longitude to be 14\u00b0 19\u2019 Virgo; from the Neck of Leo, 14\u00b0 23\u2019 36\u201c. The mean of these two is 14\u00b0 21\u2019 18\u201c Virgo. And since the sextant gave distances larger than the truth, the latitude would come out at 4\u00b0 14\u2019 north.\nOn the night following February 23, at 12h, he observed Mars in relation to five fixed stars: the Tail of Leo and Arcturus for latitude, and for the longitude, in the first instance, Spica (which followed it), and, in the second, the Neck of Leo and Cor Leonis (which preceded it).\nBy a rough estimate, I foresee that Mars is going to fall at 11\u00bc\u00b0 Virgo. It was found to be 9\u00b0 24\u2019 from the Tail of Leo, and hence, its latitude comes out at 4\u00b0 6\u2019 ^32. And now, through this and the latitudes of the fixed stars, together with their distances (17\u00b0 26\u2019 from Regulus, 17\u00b0 51\u2019 from the Neck of Leo, 37\u00b0 28\u2019 from Spica, 44\u00b0 15\u2019 from Arcturus), Mars\u2019s position comes out at 11\u00b0 21\u2019 23\u201c Virgo (from Regulus), 11\u00b0 20\u2019 52\u201c Virgo (from the Neck of Leo), and 11\u00b0 17\u2019 40\u201c (from Spica). Again (as you see) the distances err in being too great. For from the Heart and the Neck [of Leo], Mars is pushed a little eastward, and from Spica and Arcturus a little westward, and more from Arcturus, owing to its greater northern latitude ^33. The mean (ignoring Arcturus), 11\u00b0 19\u2019 20\u201c Virgo, is very nearly true. Also, the latitude is greater, namely, 4\u00b0 7\u2019 40\u201c north. Now from February 15 at 17h to 23 February at 12h, a period of 7 days 19 hours, Mars moved 3\u00b0 0\u2019: 180 minutes in 187 hours. That is, about one minute per hour. And if you wish to take it into account, the parallax (if any) is subtracted from the longitude on February 16 and a little is added on February 23.\n Because the last observation follows the time of observation found by me by 2 days 21 hours 47 min., add the motion corresponding to this time, 1\u00b0 7\u2019: the position will come out 12\u00b0 26\u2019 Virgo. The agreement is thus very good\u2014it could not be better\u2014given that both of us [that is, Kepler and Fabricius] work independently and do not rely on the facilities used by Tycho Brahe.","1688":"VIII. On 1595 October 30 at 8h 20m, the planet was found at 17\u00b0 47\u2019 15\u201c Taurus,19 not far from the nonagesimal. We may thus be sure of the parallax, although we must take it into account. The latitude was 0\u00b0 5\u2019 10\u201c north. The sun\u2019s position was 16\u00b0 50\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio. The distance between the stars was 56\u2019 45\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 35\u201c; that of Mars, 22\u2019 54\u201c, as appears by comparing the nearby observations. The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 23\u2019 29\u201c. If the distance between the stars be divided by this, it comes out to 40\u2019 47\u201c of a day, or 16 hours 19 min. Therefore, the true opposition was 0h 39m PM on October 31. Mars\u2019s position was 17\u00b0 31\u2019 40\u201c Taurus. This needs no reduction to the orbit, as it is nearly at the node. The latitude was about 0\u00b0 8\u2019 north. But comparison with the preceding and following days shows a latitude of about 5\u2019 north.\nIX. Let, at any rate, Mars\u2019s position on 1597 December 10 at 8h 30m be 3\u00b0 45\u00bd\u2019 Cancer (as above) ^20. The sun\u2019s position was 29\u00b0 4\u2019 53\u201c Sagittarius. The distance between the stars was 4\u00b0 40\u2019 37\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 61\u2019 20\u201c, that of Mars 23\u2019 40\u201c (for in 1580 the diurnal motion in Gemini was 23\u2019, and in 1582, at 17\u00b0 Cancer, it was 24\u2019). Therefore, the sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 25\u2019 0\u201c. These data show that the time of true opposition followed 3 days 7 hours 14 min. later, on December 14 at 3h 44m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 2\u00b0 27\u2153\u2019 Cancer. The reduction to the orbit (quite ridiculous here, since the observation itself has an uncertainty of several minutes) requires the addition of about 52\u201c. Therefore, the corrected position was 2\u00b0 28\u2019 Cancer. The latitude, from the table, was 3\u00b0 33\u2019 north.\nOn the same night, the one following December 10, at 12\u2159h, Fabricius in East Frisia found Mars\u2019s position to be 3\u00b0 40\u00bc\u2019 Cancer with latitude 3\u00b0 23\u2019 N. In this observation the longitude comes out nearly the same. For the motion over 3h 40m is 3\u00bd\u2019, so that in the Brahean observation too, at 12\u2159h Mars could have been at 3\u00b0 42\u2019 Cancer\u2014two minutes beyond the Fabrician position.\nX. On 1600 January 13\/23 at 11h 40m, the time being adjusted to Uraniborg time, the planet was observed at 10\u00b0 38\u2019 46\u201c Leo ^21. The sun\u2019s position was 3\u00b0 26\u2019 30\u201c Aquarius. The stars were 7\u00b0 12\u2019 16\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion for the next few days was 1\u00b0 1\u2019 3\u201c; that of Mars, 23\u2019 44\u201c. The sum: 1\u00b0 24\u2019 47\u201c. The opposition therefore followed 5 days 2h 22m after; that is, on January 19\/29 at 2h 2m in the morning, before dawn. Mars was at 8\u00b0 38\u2019 Leo. There is no need for reduction, since it is near the limit. The latitude, from the table, was 4\u00b0 30\u2019 50\u201c N.\nXI. On the evening of 1602 Febr. 18\/28 at 10h 30m, using the Tychonic  instruments (with the help of the learned Matthias Seiffard,22 bequeathed us by Tycho), I took the distance of Mars from the middle star of the tail of Ursa Major 23 to be 52\u00b0 22\u2019. And since the distance between Cor Leonis and Procyon was 37\u00b0 22\u2019 20\u201c, which should have been 37\u00b0 19\u2019 50\u201c,24 we know that the sextant reads 2\u00bd minutes high. Therefore, the corrected distance of Mars from the tail of Ursa was 52\u00b0 19\u00bd\u2019. And since the latitude of the fixed star is 56\u00b0 22\u2019, the remainder, by subtraction, is 4\u00b0 2\u00bd\u2019\u2014supposing that Mars was at precisely the same longitude as the fixed star. But because there was a difference of 3\u00be degrees between them (as is clear from the following observations), a slight correction is required.\n For let AB be 3\u00b0 43\u2019 30\u201c on a parallel close to the ecliptic, B Mars, C the fixed star, and BC 52\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c. Dividing the secant of BC by the secant of AB gives the  secant of CA, 52\u00b0 14\u2019, which, subtracted from 56\u00b0 22\u2019 (the latitude of the fixed star) leaves 4\u00b0 8\u2019 north as Mars\u2019s observed latitude. At the same time, we found 19\u00b0 23\u2019 between Mars and Cor Leonis (19\u00b0 20\u00bd corrected), and 21\u00b0 20\u2019 between Mars and the bright star in the wing of Virgo25 (21\u00b0 17\u00bd\u2019 corrected). From these two distances (using the latitudes of the stars and Mars), Mars\u2019s longitude is found to be 13\u00b0 19\u2019 6\u201c Virgo, by consensus of all measurements.\nAlternatively, the meridian altitude of Mars was found at 12h 40m, using two quadrants, to be 50\u00b0 19\u2019, while the tail of Leo26 was 56\u00b0 45\u2019. Therefore, from the declinations and right ascensions of the fixed stars and our distances, Mars\u2019s position is determined as 13\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c Virgo, latitude 4\u00b0 7\u2019 55\u201c ^27. This is the Tychonic procedure. I have included the other for the sake of showing a consensus, and also that it might be evident that despite the lack of absolute perfection in the demonstration, short cuts either in computation or in our understanding can under certain circumstances be applied. For in that previous procedure there is less in the actual work than in the reporting of it. At Prague, 5\u00b0 Scorpio was rising ^28. Therefore, the nonagesimal was about 32\u00bd\u00b0 from the zenith. And since Mars\u2019s distance from the earth was rather more than half the sun\u2019s distance, the resulting parallax of about 5\u2019 opposite 32\u00bd\u00b0 in our parallactic table, shows a latitudinal parallax of 2\u2019 41\u201c. Thus the latitude as seen from the middle of the earth would be 4\u00b0 10\u2154\u2019 north. And because the altitude of the nonagesimal was 57\u00bd\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax at the horizon was 4\u2019 13\u201c. But since Mars was 38\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, the longitudinal parallax corresponding to this position is 2\u2019 36\u201c, and if this be eliminated, Mars would be placed at about 13\u00b0 18\u2019 Virgo ^29. At that moment, the sun\u2019s position was 10\u00b0 16\u2019 42\u201c Pisces. The distance between the bodies was 3\u00b0 1\u2019 18\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 4\u201c, and that of Mars, 24\u2019 5\u201c (for it was 24\u2019 18\u201c at 21\u00b0 Leo in 1585, and 24\u2019 at 26 Virgo in 1587). The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 24\u2019 9\u201c. The true opposition therefore followed 2 days 3 hours 43 minutes later, on 21 February\/3 March before dawn at 2h 13m, Mars being at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 35\u201c Virgo. Forty seconds must be subtracted to reduce the position to the orbit, putting Mars at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 Virgo, with slightly less latitude than before, since the latitude was then decreasing. It was therefore about 4\u00b0 10\u2019, or 4\u00b0 7\u2153\u2019 if the parallax be neglected.\n But because, since Tycho\u2019s death, we have not made frequent observations nor continued them over several days, it would be best, for certainty\u2019s sake, also to make use of those observations which David Fabricius of East Frisia, a sedulous practitioner of astronomy, has communicated to me.\nOn February 16, old style, at 5h in the morning, he took the planet\u2019s distances from the tail of Leo (for the latitude), from the neck of Leo,30 and, on the other hand, from the bright star in the southern wing of Virgo, so as to check its longitude by working it out twice.\nI could make use of Tycho\u2019s line of reasoning, which he routinely adopted in volume I of the Progymnasmata when (as here) the declination of the planet was not known. But because that method extends to ten operations, I prefer for the sake of brevity to proceed as I did before with my own observations. Here there are no hidden dangers.\nFirst, the star in the wing of Virgo, adjusted to our time, is at 4\u00b0 36\u2019 30\u201c Libra with latitude 2\u00b0 50\u2019 north. Fabricius found that Mars is 20\u00b0 18\u2019 westward from it on the zodiac, which puts Mars at about 14\u00b0 18\u2019 30\u201c Virgo. This is a preliminary, approximate figure: the longitude will shortly be corrected. Now the tail of Leo31 is at 16\u00b0 4\u2019 Virgo, with latitude 12\u00b0 18\u2019 North, and Mars was found to be 8\u00b0 17\u2019 distant from the Tail. What is sought is the distance of its parallel from the Tail, since the difference in longitude is 1\u00b0 45\u2019. Dividing the secant of 8\u00b0 17\u2019 by the secant of 1\u00b0 45\u2019 gives the secant of 8\u00b0 6\u2019, the arc sought. This subtracted from the fixed star\u2019s northern latitude of 12\u00b0 18\u2019 leaves Mars\u2019s latitude, 4\u00b0 12\u2019 north. This I now take as determined, and compare it with the latitudes of the fixed stars according to the laws of trigonometry. From the Wing of Virgo, I find Mars\u2019s longitude to be 14\u00b0 19\u2019 Virgo; from the Neck of Leo, 14\u00b0 23\u2019 36\u201c. The mean of these two is 14\u00b0 21\u2019 18\u201c Virgo. And since the sextant gave distances larger than the truth, the latitude would come out at 4\u00b0 14\u2019 north.\nOn the night following February 23, at 12h, he observed Mars in relation to five fixed stars: the Tail of Leo and Arcturus for latitude, and for the longitude, in the first instance, Spica (which followed it), and, in the second, the Neck of Leo and Cor Leonis (which preceded it).\nBy a rough estimate, I foresee that Mars is going to fall at 11\u00bc\u00b0 Virgo. It was found to be 9\u00b0 24\u2019 from the Tail of Leo, and hence, its latitude comes out at 4\u00b0 6\u2019 ^32. And now, through this and the latitudes of the fixed stars, together with their distances (17\u00b0 26\u2019 from Regulus, 17\u00b0 51\u2019 from the Neck of Leo, 37\u00b0 28\u2019 from Spica, 44\u00b0 15\u2019 from Arcturus), Mars\u2019s position comes out at 11\u00b0 21\u2019 23\u201c Virgo (from Regulus), 11\u00b0 20\u2019 52\u201c Virgo (from the Neck of Leo), and 11\u00b0 17\u2019 40\u201c (from Spica). Again (as you see) the distances err in being too great. For from the Heart and the Neck [of Leo], Mars is pushed a little eastward, and from Spica and Arcturus a little westward, and more from Arcturus, owing to its greater northern latitude ^33. The mean (ignoring Arcturus), 11\u00b0 19\u2019 20\u201c Virgo, is very nearly true. Also, the latitude is greater, namely, 4\u00b0 7\u2019 40\u201c north. Now from February 15 at 17h to 23 February at 12h, a period of 7 days 19 hours, Mars moved 3\u00b0 0\u2019: 180 minutes in 187 hours. That is, about one minute per hour. And if you wish to take it into account, the parallax (if any) is subtracted from the longitude on February 16 and a little is added on February 23.\n Because the last observation follows the time of observation found by me by 2 days 21 hours 47 min., add the motion corresponding to this time, 1\u00b0 7\u2019: the position will come out 12\u00b0 26\u2019 Virgo. The agreement is thus very good\u2014it could not be better\u2014given that both of us [that is, Kepler and Fabricius] work independently and do not rely on the facilities used by Tycho Brahe.","1689":"VIII. On 1595 October 30 at 8h 20m, the planet was found at 17\u00b0 47\u2019 15\u201c Taurus,19 not far from the nonagesimal. We may thus be sure of the parallax, although we must take it into account. The latitude was 0\u00b0 5\u2019 10\u201c north. The sun\u2019s position was 16\u00b0 50\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio. The distance between the stars was 56\u2019 45\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 35\u201c; that of Mars, 22\u2019 54\u201c, as appears by comparing the nearby observations. The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 23\u2019 29\u201c. If the distance between the stars be divided by this, it comes out to 40\u2019 47\u201c of a day, or 16 hours 19 min. Therefore, the true opposition was 0h 39m PM on October 31. Mars\u2019s position was 17\u00b0 31\u2019 40\u201c Taurus. This needs no reduction to the orbit, as it is nearly at the node. The latitude was about 0\u00b0 8\u2019 north. But comparison with the preceding and following days shows a latitude of about 5\u2019 north.\nIX. Let, at any rate, Mars\u2019s position on 1597 December 10 at 8h 30m be 3\u00b0 45\u00bd\u2019 Cancer (as above) ^20. The sun\u2019s position was 29\u00b0 4\u2019 53\u201c Sagittarius. The distance between the stars was 4\u00b0 40\u2019 37\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 61\u2019 20\u201c, that of Mars 23\u2019 40\u201c (for in 1580 the diurnal motion in Gemini was 23\u2019, and in 1582, at 17\u00b0 Cancer, it was 24\u2019). Therefore, the sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 25\u2019 0\u201c. These data show that the time of true opposition followed 3 days 7 hours 14 min. later, on December 14 at 3h 44m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 2\u00b0 27\u2153\u2019 Cancer. The reduction to the orbit (quite ridiculous here, since the observation itself has an uncertainty of several minutes) requires the addition of about 52\u201c. Therefore, the corrected position was 2\u00b0 28\u2019 Cancer. The latitude, from the table, was 3\u00b0 33\u2019 north.\nOn the same night, the one following December 10, at 12\u2159h, Fabricius in East Frisia found Mars\u2019s position to be 3\u00b0 40\u00bc\u2019 Cancer with latitude 3\u00b0 23\u2019 N. In this observation the longitude comes out nearly the same. For the motion over 3h 40m is 3\u00bd\u2019, so that in the Brahean observation too, at 12\u2159h Mars could have been at 3\u00b0 42\u2019 Cancer\u2014two minutes beyond the Fabrician position.\nX. On 1600 January 13\/23 at 11h 40m, the time being adjusted to Uraniborg time, the planet was observed at 10\u00b0 38\u2019 46\u201c Leo ^21. The sun\u2019s position was 3\u00b0 26\u2019 30\u201c Aquarius. The stars were 7\u00b0 12\u2019 16\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion for the next few days was 1\u00b0 1\u2019 3\u201c; that of Mars, 23\u2019 44\u201c. The sum: 1\u00b0 24\u2019 47\u201c. The opposition therefore followed 5 days 2h 22m after; that is, on January 19\/29 at 2h 2m in the morning, before dawn. Mars was at 8\u00b0 38\u2019 Leo. There is no need for reduction, since it is near the limit. The latitude, from the table, was 4\u00b0 30\u2019 50\u201c N.\nXI. On the evening of 1602 Febr. 18\/28 at 10h 30m, using the Tychonic  instruments (with the help of the learned Matthias Seiffard,22 bequeathed us by Tycho), I took the distance of Mars from the middle star of the tail of Ursa Major 23 to be 52\u00b0 22\u2019. And since the distance between Cor Leonis and Procyon was 37\u00b0 22\u2019 20\u201c, which should have been 37\u00b0 19\u2019 50\u201c,24 we know that the sextant reads 2\u00bd minutes high. Therefore, the corrected distance of Mars from the tail of Ursa was 52\u00b0 19\u00bd\u2019. And since the latitude of the fixed star is 56\u00b0 22\u2019, the remainder, by subtraction, is 4\u00b0 2\u00bd\u2019\u2014supposing that Mars was at precisely the same longitude as the fixed star. But because there was a difference of 3\u00be degrees between them (as is clear from the following observations), a slight correction is required.\n For let AB be 3\u00b0 43\u2019 30\u201c on a parallel close to the ecliptic, B Mars, C the fixed star, and BC 52\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c. Dividing the secant of BC by the secant of AB gives the  secant of CA, 52\u00b0 14\u2019, which, subtracted from 56\u00b0 22\u2019 (the latitude of the fixed star) leaves 4\u00b0 8\u2019 north as Mars\u2019s observed latitude. At the same time, we found 19\u00b0 23\u2019 between Mars and Cor Leonis (19\u00b0 20\u00bd corrected), and 21\u00b0 20\u2019 between Mars and the bright star in the wing of Virgo25 (21\u00b0 17\u00bd\u2019 corrected). From these two distances (using the latitudes of the stars and Mars), Mars\u2019s longitude is found to be 13\u00b0 19\u2019 6\u201c Virgo, by consensus of all measurements.\nAlternatively, the meridian altitude of Mars was found at 12h 40m, using two quadrants, to be 50\u00b0 19\u2019, while the tail of Leo26 was 56\u00b0 45\u2019. Therefore, from the declinations and right ascensions of the fixed stars and our distances, Mars\u2019s position is determined as 13\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c Virgo, latitude 4\u00b0 7\u2019 55\u201c ^27. This is the Tychonic procedure. I have included the other for the sake of showing a consensus, and also that it might be evident that despite the lack of absolute perfection in the demonstration, short cuts either in computation or in our understanding can under certain circumstances be applied. For in that previous procedure there is less in the actual work than in the reporting of it. At Prague, 5\u00b0 Scorpio was rising ^28. Therefore, the nonagesimal was about 32\u00bd\u00b0 from the zenith. And since Mars\u2019s distance from the earth was rather more than half the sun\u2019s distance, the resulting parallax of about 5\u2019 opposite 32\u00bd\u00b0 in our parallactic table, shows a latitudinal parallax of 2\u2019 41\u201c. Thus the latitude as seen from the middle of the earth would be 4\u00b0 10\u2154\u2019 north. And because the altitude of the nonagesimal was 57\u00bd\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax at the horizon was 4\u2019 13\u201c. But since Mars was 38\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, the longitudinal parallax corresponding to this position is 2\u2019 36\u201c, and if this be eliminated, Mars would be placed at about 13\u00b0 18\u2019 Virgo ^29. At that moment, the sun\u2019s position was 10\u00b0 16\u2019 42\u201c Pisces. The distance between the bodies was 3\u00b0 1\u2019 18\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 4\u201c, and that of Mars, 24\u2019 5\u201c (for it was 24\u2019 18\u201c at 21\u00b0 Leo in 1585, and 24\u2019 at 26 Virgo in 1587). The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 24\u2019 9\u201c. The true opposition therefore followed 2 days 3 hours 43 minutes later, on 21 February\/3 March before dawn at 2h 13m, Mars being at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 35\u201c Virgo. Forty seconds must be subtracted to reduce the position to the orbit, putting Mars at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 Virgo, with slightly less latitude than before, since the latitude was then decreasing. It was therefore about 4\u00b0 10\u2019, or 4\u00b0 7\u2153\u2019 if the parallax be neglected.\n But because, since Tycho\u2019s death, we have not made frequent observations nor continued them over several days, it would be best, for certainty\u2019s sake, also to make use of those observations which David Fabricius of East Frisia, a sedulous practitioner of astronomy, has communicated to me.\nOn February 16, old style, at 5h in the morning, he took the planet\u2019s distances from the tail of Leo (for the latitude), from the neck of Leo,30 and, on the other hand, from the bright star in the southern wing of Virgo, so as to check its longitude by working it out twice.\nI could make use of Tycho\u2019s line of reasoning, which he routinely adopted in volume I of the Progymnasmata when (as here) the declination of the planet was not known. But because that method extends to ten operations, I prefer for the sake of brevity to proceed as I did before with my own observations. Here there are no hidden dangers.\nFirst, the star in the wing of Virgo, adjusted to our time, is at 4\u00b0 36\u2019 30\u201c Libra with latitude 2\u00b0 50\u2019 north. Fabricius found that Mars is 20\u00b0 18\u2019 westward from it on the zodiac, which puts Mars at about 14\u00b0 18\u2019 30\u201c Virgo. This is a preliminary, approximate figure: the longitude will shortly be corrected. Now the tail of Leo31 is at 16\u00b0 4\u2019 Virgo, with latitude 12\u00b0 18\u2019 North, and Mars was found to be 8\u00b0 17\u2019 distant from the Tail. What is sought is the distance of its parallel from the Tail, since the difference in longitude is 1\u00b0 45\u2019. Dividing the secant of 8\u00b0 17\u2019 by the secant of 1\u00b0 45\u2019 gives the secant of 8\u00b0 6\u2019, the arc sought. This subtracted from the fixed star\u2019s northern latitude of 12\u00b0 18\u2019 leaves Mars\u2019s latitude, 4\u00b0 12\u2019 north. This I now take as determined, and compare it with the latitudes of the fixed stars according to the laws of trigonometry. From the Wing of Virgo, I find Mars\u2019s longitude to be 14\u00b0 19\u2019 Virgo; from the Neck of Leo, 14\u00b0 23\u2019 36\u201c. The mean of these two is 14\u00b0 21\u2019 18\u201c Virgo. And since the sextant gave distances larger than the truth, the latitude would come out at 4\u00b0 14\u2019 north.\nOn the night following February 23, at 12h, he observed Mars in relation to five fixed stars: the Tail of Leo and Arcturus for latitude, and for the longitude, in the first instance, Spica (which followed it), and, in the second, the Neck of Leo and Cor Leonis (which preceded it).\nBy a rough estimate, I foresee that Mars is going to fall at 11\u00bc\u00b0 Virgo. It was found to be 9\u00b0 24\u2019 from the Tail of Leo, and hence, its latitude comes out at 4\u00b0 6\u2019 ^32. And now, through this and the latitudes of the fixed stars, together with their distances (17\u00b0 26\u2019 from Regulus, 17\u00b0 51\u2019 from the Neck of Leo, 37\u00b0 28\u2019 from Spica, 44\u00b0 15\u2019 from Arcturus), Mars\u2019s position comes out at 11\u00b0 21\u2019 23\u201c Virgo (from Regulus), 11\u00b0 20\u2019 52\u201c Virgo (from the Neck of Leo), and 11\u00b0 17\u2019 40\u201c (from Spica). Again (as you see) the distances err in being too great. For from the Heart and the Neck [of Leo], Mars is pushed a little eastward, and from Spica and Arcturus a little westward, and more from Arcturus, owing to its greater northern latitude ^33. The mean (ignoring Arcturus), 11\u00b0 19\u2019 20\u201c Virgo, is very nearly true. Also, the latitude is greater, namely, 4\u00b0 7\u2019 40\u201c north. Now from February 15 at 17h to 23 February at 12h, a period of 7 days 19 hours, Mars moved 3\u00b0 0\u2019: 180 minutes in 187 hours. That is, about one minute per hour. And if you wish to take it into account, the parallax (if any) is subtracted from the longitude on February 16 and a little is added on February 23.\n Because the last observation follows the time of observation found by me by 2 days 21 hours 47 min., add the motion corresponding to this time, 1\u00b0 7\u2019: the position will come out 12\u00b0 26\u2019 Virgo. The agreement is thus very good\u2014it could not be better\u2014given that both of us [that is, Kepler and Fabricius] work independently and do not rely on the facilities used by Tycho Brahe.","1690":"VIII. On 1595 October 30 at 8h 20m, the planet was found at 17\u00b0 47\u2019 15\u201c Taurus,19 not far from the nonagesimal. We may thus be sure of the parallax, although we must take it into account. The latitude was 0\u00b0 5\u2019 10\u201c north. The sun\u2019s position was 16\u00b0 50\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio. The distance between the stars was 56\u2019 45\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 35\u201c; that of Mars, 22\u2019 54\u201c, as appears by comparing the nearby observations. The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 23\u2019 29\u201c. If the distance between the stars be divided by this, it comes out to 40\u2019 47\u201c of a day, or 16 hours 19 min. Therefore, the true opposition was 0h 39m PM on October 31. Mars\u2019s position was 17\u00b0 31\u2019 40\u201c Taurus. This needs no reduction to the orbit, as it is nearly at the node. The latitude was about 0\u00b0 8\u2019 north. But comparison with the preceding and following days shows a latitude of about 5\u2019 north.\nIX. Let, at any rate, Mars\u2019s position on 1597 December 10 at 8h 30m be 3\u00b0 45\u00bd\u2019 Cancer (as above) ^20. The sun\u2019s position was 29\u00b0 4\u2019 53\u201c Sagittarius. The distance between the stars was 4\u00b0 40\u2019 37\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 61\u2019 20\u201c, that of Mars 23\u2019 40\u201c (for in 1580 the diurnal motion in Gemini was 23\u2019, and in 1582, at 17\u00b0 Cancer, it was 24\u2019). Therefore, the sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 25\u2019 0\u201c. These data show that the time of true opposition followed 3 days 7 hours 14 min. later, on December 14 at 3h 44m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 2\u00b0 27\u2153\u2019 Cancer. The reduction to the orbit (quite ridiculous here, since the observation itself has an uncertainty of several minutes) requires the addition of about 52\u201c. Therefore, the corrected position was 2\u00b0 28\u2019 Cancer. The latitude, from the table, was 3\u00b0 33\u2019 north.\nOn the same night, the one following December 10, at 12\u2159h, Fabricius in East Frisia found Mars\u2019s position to be 3\u00b0 40\u00bc\u2019 Cancer with latitude 3\u00b0 23\u2019 N. In this observation the longitude comes out nearly the same. For the motion over 3h 40m is 3\u00bd\u2019, so that in the Brahean observation too, at 12\u2159h Mars could have been at 3\u00b0 42\u2019 Cancer\u2014two minutes beyond the Fabrician position.\nX. On 1600 January 13\/23 at 11h 40m, the time being adjusted to Uraniborg time, the planet was observed at 10\u00b0 38\u2019 46\u201c Leo ^21. The sun\u2019s position was 3\u00b0 26\u2019 30\u201c Aquarius. The stars were 7\u00b0 12\u2019 16\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion for the next few days was 1\u00b0 1\u2019 3\u201c; that of Mars, 23\u2019 44\u201c. The sum: 1\u00b0 24\u2019 47\u201c. The opposition therefore followed 5 days 2h 22m after; that is, on January 19\/29 at 2h 2m in the morning, before dawn. Mars was at 8\u00b0 38\u2019 Leo. There is no need for reduction, since it is near the limit. The latitude, from the table, was 4\u00b0 30\u2019 50\u201c N.\nXI. On the evening of 1602 Febr. 18\/28 at 10h 30m, using the Tychonic  instruments (with the help of the learned Matthias Seiffard,22 bequeathed us by Tycho), I took the distance of Mars from the middle star of the tail of Ursa Major 23 to be 52\u00b0 22\u2019. And since the distance between Cor Leonis and Procyon was 37\u00b0 22\u2019 20\u201c, which should have been 37\u00b0 19\u2019 50\u201c,24 we know that the sextant reads 2\u00bd minutes high. Therefore, the corrected distance of Mars from the tail of Ursa was 52\u00b0 19\u00bd\u2019. And since the latitude of the fixed star is 56\u00b0 22\u2019, the remainder, by subtraction, is 4\u00b0 2\u00bd\u2019\u2014supposing that Mars was at precisely the same longitude as the fixed star. But because there was a difference of 3\u00be degrees between them (as is clear from the following observations), a slight correction is required.\n For let AB be 3\u00b0 43\u2019 30\u201c on a parallel close to the ecliptic, B Mars, C the fixed star, and BC 52\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c. Dividing the secant of BC by the secant of AB gives the  secant of CA, 52\u00b0 14\u2019, which, subtracted from 56\u00b0 22\u2019 (the latitude of the fixed star) leaves 4\u00b0 8\u2019 north as Mars\u2019s observed latitude. At the same time, we found 19\u00b0 23\u2019 between Mars and Cor Leonis (19\u00b0 20\u00bd corrected), and 21\u00b0 20\u2019 between Mars and the bright star in the wing of Virgo25 (21\u00b0 17\u00bd\u2019 corrected). From these two distances (using the latitudes of the stars and Mars), Mars\u2019s longitude is found to be 13\u00b0 19\u2019 6\u201c Virgo, by consensus of all measurements.\nAlternatively, the meridian altitude of Mars was found at 12h 40m, using two quadrants, to be 50\u00b0 19\u2019, while the tail of Leo26 was 56\u00b0 45\u2019. Therefore, from the declinations and right ascensions of the fixed stars and our distances, Mars\u2019s position is determined as 13\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c Virgo, latitude 4\u00b0 7\u2019 55\u201c ^27. This is the Tychonic procedure. I have included the other for the sake of showing a consensus, and also that it might be evident that despite the lack of absolute perfection in the demonstration, short cuts either in computation or in our understanding can under certain circumstances be applied. For in that previous procedure there is less in the actual work than in the reporting of it. At Prague, 5\u00b0 Scorpio was rising ^28. Therefore, the nonagesimal was about 32\u00bd\u00b0 from the zenith. And since Mars\u2019s distance from the earth was rather more than half the sun\u2019s distance, the resulting parallax of about 5\u2019 opposite 32\u00bd\u00b0 in our parallactic table, shows a latitudinal parallax of 2\u2019 41\u201c. Thus the latitude as seen from the middle of the earth would be 4\u00b0 10\u2154\u2019 north. And because the altitude of the nonagesimal was 57\u00bd\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax at the horizon was 4\u2019 13\u201c. But since Mars was 38\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, the longitudinal parallax corresponding to this position is 2\u2019 36\u201c, and if this be eliminated, Mars would be placed at about 13\u00b0 18\u2019 Virgo ^29. At that moment, the sun\u2019s position was 10\u00b0 16\u2019 42\u201c Pisces. The distance between the bodies was 3\u00b0 1\u2019 18\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 4\u201c, and that of Mars, 24\u2019 5\u201c (for it was 24\u2019 18\u201c at 21\u00b0 Leo in 1585, and 24\u2019 at 26 Virgo in 1587). The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 24\u2019 9\u201c. The true opposition therefore followed 2 days 3 hours 43 minutes later, on 21 February\/3 March before dawn at 2h 13m, Mars being at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 35\u201c Virgo. Forty seconds must be subtracted to reduce the position to the orbit, putting Mars at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 Virgo, with slightly less latitude than before, since the latitude was then decreasing. It was therefore about 4\u00b0 10\u2019, or 4\u00b0 7\u2153\u2019 if the parallax be neglected.\n But because, since Tycho\u2019s death, we have not made frequent observations nor continued them over several days, it would be best, for certainty\u2019s sake, also to make use of those observations which David Fabricius of East Frisia, a sedulous practitioner of astronomy, has communicated to me.\nOn February 16, old style, at 5h in the morning, he took the planet\u2019s distances from the tail of Leo (for the latitude), from the neck of Leo,30 and, on the other hand, from the bright star in the southern wing of Virgo, so as to check its longitude by working it out twice.\nI could make use of Tycho\u2019s line of reasoning, which he routinely adopted in volume I of the Progymnasmata when (as here) the declination of the planet was not known. But because that method extends to ten operations, I prefer for the sake of brevity to proceed as I did before with my own observations. Here there are no hidden dangers.\nFirst, the star in the wing of Virgo, adjusted to our time, is at 4\u00b0 36\u2019 30\u201c Libra with latitude 2\u00b0 50\u2019 north. Fabricius found that Mars is 20\u00b0 18\u2019 westward from it on the zodiac, which puts Mars at about 14\u00b0 18\u2019 30\u201c Virgo. This is a preliminary, approximate figure: the longitude will shortly be corrected. Now the tail of Leo31 is at 16\u00b0 4\u2019 Virgo, with latitude 12\u00b0 18\u2019 North, and Mars was found to be 8\u00b0 17\u2019 distant from the Tail. What is sought is the distance of its parallel from the Tail, since the difference in longitude is 1\u00b0 45\u2019. Dividing the secant of 8\u00b0 17\u2019 by the secant of 1\u00b0 45\u2019 gives the secant of 8\u00b0 6\u2019, the arc sought. This subtracted from the fixed star\u2019s northern latitude of 12\u00b0 18\u2019 leaves Mars\u2019s latitude, 4\u00b0 12\u2019 north. This I now take as determined, and compare it with the latitudes of the fixed stars according to the laws of trigonometry. From the Wing of Virgo, I find Mars\u2019s longitude to be 14\u00b0 19\u2019 Virgo; from the Neck of Leo, 14\u00b0 23\u2019 36\u201c. The mean of these two is 14\u00b0 21\u2019 18\u201c Virgo. And since the sextant gave distances larger than the truth, the latitude would come out at 4\u00b0 14\u2019 north.\nOn the night following February 23, at 12h, he observed Mars in relation to five fixed stars: the Tail of Leo and Arcturus for latitude, and for the longitude, in the first instance, Spica (which followed it), and, in the second, the Neck of Leo and Cor Leonis (which preceded it).\nBy a rough estimate, I foresee that Mars is going to fall at 11\u00bc\u00b0 Virgo. It was found to be 9\u00b0 24\u2019 from the Tail of Leo, and hence, its latitude comes out at 4\u00b0 6\u2019 ^32. And now, through this and the latitudes of the fixed stars, together with their distances (17\u00b0 26\u2019 from Regulus, 17\u00b0 51\u2019 from the Neck of Leo, 37\u00b0 28\u2019 from Spica, 44\u00b0 15\u2019 from Arcturus), Mars\u2019s position comes out at 11\u00b0 21\u2019 23\u201c Virgo (from Regulus), 11\u00b0 20\u2019 52\u201c Virgo (from the Neck of Leo), and 11\u00b0 17\u2019 40\u201c (from Spica). Again (as you see) the distances err in being too great. For from the Heart and the Neck [of Leo], Mars is pushed a little eastward, and from Spica and Arcturus a little westward, and more from Arcturus, owing to its greater northern latitude ^33. The mean (ignoring Arcturus), 11\u00b0 19\u2019 20\u201c Virgo, is very nearly true. Also, the latitude is greater, namely, 4\u00b0 7\u2019 40\u201c north. Now from February 15 at 17h to 23 February at 12h, a period of 7 days 19 hours, Mars moved 3\u00b0 0\u2019: 180 minutes in 187 hours. That is, about one minute per hour. And if you wish to take it into account, the parallax (if any) is subtracted from the longitude on February 16 and a little is added on February 23.\n Because the last observation follows the time of observation found by me by 2 days 21 hours 47 min., add the motion corresponding to this time, 1\u00b0 7\u2019: the position will come out 12\u00b0 26\u2019 Virgo. The agreement is thus very good\u2014it could not be better\u2014given that both of us [that is, Kepler and Fabricius] work independently and do not rely on the facilities used by Tycho Brahe.","1691":"VIII. On 1595 October 30 at 8h 20m, the planet was found at 17\u00b0 47\u2019 15\u201c Taurus,19 not far from the nonagesimal. We may thus be sure of the parallax, although we must take it into account. The latitude was 0\u00b0 5\u2019 10\u201c north. The sun\u2019s position was 16\u00b0 50\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio. The distance between the stars was 56\u2019 45\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 35\u201c; that of Mars, 22\u2019 54\u201c, as appears by comparing the nearby observations. The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 23\u2019 29\u201c. If the distance between the stars be divided by this, it comes out to 40\u2019 47\u201c of a day, or 16 hours 19 min. Therefore, the true opposition was 0h 39m PM on October 31. Mars\u2019s position was 17\u00b0 31\u2019 40\u201c Taurus. This needs no reduction to the orbit, as it is nearly at the node. The latitude was about 0\u00b0 8\u2019 north. But comparison with the preceding and following days shows a latitude of about 5\u2019 north.\nIX. Let, at any rate, Mars\u2019s position on 1597 December 10 at 8h 30m be 3\u00b0 45\u00bd\u2019 Cancer (as above) ^20. The sun\u2019s position was 29\u00b0 4\u2019 53\u201c Sagittarius. The distance between the stars was 4\u00b0 40\u2019 37\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 61\u2019 20\u201c, that of Mars 23\u2019 40\u201c (for in 1580 the diurnal motion in Gemini was 23\u2019, and in 1582, at 17\u00b0 Cancer, it was 24\u2019). Therefore, the sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 25\u2019 0\u201c. These data show that the time of true opposition followed 3 days 7 hours 14 min. later, on December 14 at 3h 44m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 2\u00b0 27\u2153\u2019 Cancer. The reduction to the orbit (quite ridiculous here, since the observation itself has an uncertainty of several minutes) requires the addition of about 52\u201c. Therefore, the corrected position was 2\u00b0 28\u2019 Cancer. The latitude, from the table, was 3\u00b0 33\u2019 north.\nOn the same night, the one following December 10, at 12\u2159h, Fabricius in East Frisia found Mars\u2019s position to be 3\u00b0 40\u00bc\u2019 Cancer with latitude 3\u00b0 23\u2019 N. In this observation the longitude comes out nearly the same. For the motion over 3h 40m is 3\u00bd\u2019, so that in the Brahean observation too, at 12\u2159h Mars could have been at 3\u00b0 42\u2019 Cancer\u2014two minutes beyond the Fabrician position.\nX. On 1600 January 13\/23 at 11h 40m, the time being adjusted to Uraniborg time, the planet was observed at 10\u00b0 38\u2019 46\u201c Leo ^21. The sun\u2019s position was 3\u00b0 26\u2019 30\u201c Aquarius. The stars were 7\u00b0 12\u2019 16\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion for the next few days was 1\u00b0 1\u2019 3\u201c; that of Mars, 23\u2019 44\u201c. The sum: 1\u00b0 24\u2019 47\u201c. The opposition therefore followed 5 days 2h 22m after; that is, on January 19\/29 at 2h 2m in the morning, before dawn. Mars was at 8\u00b0 38\u2019 Leo. There is no need for reduction, since it is near the limit. The latitude, from the table, was 4\u00b0 30\u2019 50\u201c N.\nXI. On the evening of 1602 Febr. 18\/28 at 10h 30m, using the Tychonic  instruments (with the help of the learned Matthias Seiffard,22 bequeathed us by Tycho), I took the distance of Mars from the middle star of the tail of Ursa Major 23 to be 52\u00b0 22\u2019. And since the distance between Cor Leonis and Procyon was 37\u00b0 22\u2019 20\u201c, which should have been 37\u00b0 19\u2019 50\u201c,24 we know that the sextant reads 2\u00bd minutes high. Therefore, the corrected distance of Mars from the tail of Ursa was 52\u00b0 19\u00bd\u2019. And since the latitude of the fixed star is 56\u00b0 22\u2019, the remainder, by subtraction, is 4\u00b0 2\u00bd\u2019\u2014supposing that Mars was at precisely the same longitude as the fixed star. But because there was a difference of 3\u00be degrees between them (as is clear from the following observations), a slight correction is required.\n For let AB be 3\u00b0 43\u2019 30\u201c on a parallel close to the ecliptic, B Mars, C the fixed star, and BC 52\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c. Dividing the secant of BC by the secant of AB gives the  secant of CA, 52\u00b0 14\u2019, which, subtracted from 56\u00b0 22\u2019 (the latitude of the fixed star) leaves 4\u00b0 8\u2019 north as Mars\u2019s observed latitude. At the same time, we found 19\u00b0 23\u2019 between Mars and Cor Leonis (19\u00b0 20\u00bd corrected), and 21\u00b0 20\u2019 between Mars and the bright star in the wing of Virgo25 (21\u00b0 17\u00bd\u2019 corrected). From these two distances (using the latitudes of the stars and Mars), Mars\u2019s longitude is found to be 13\u00b0 19\u2019 6\u201c Virgo, by consensus of all measurements.\nAlternatively, the meridian altitude of Mars was found at 12h 40m, using two quadrants, to be 50\u00b0 19\u2019, while the tail of Leo26 was 56\u00b0 45\u2019. Therefore, from the declinations and right ascensions of the fixed stars and our distances, Mars\u2019s position is determined as 13\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c Virgo, latitude 4\u00b0 7\u2019 55\u201c ^27. This is the Tychonic procedure. I have included the other for the sake of showing a consensus, and also that it might be evident that despite the lack of absolute perfection in the demonstration, short cuts either in computation or in our understanding can under certain circumstances be applied. For in that previous procedure there is less in the actual work than in the reporting of it. At Prague, 5\u00b0 Scorpio was rising ^28. Therefore, the nonagesimal was about 32\u00bd\u00b0 from the zenith. And since Mars\u2019s distance from the earth was rather more than half the sun\u2019s distance, the resulting parallax of about 5\u2019 opposite 32\u00bd\u00b0 in our parallactic table, shows a latitudinal parallax of 2\u2019 41\u201c. Thus the latitude as seen from the middle of the earth would be 4\u00b0 10\u2154\u2019 north. And because the altitude of the nonagesimal was 57\u00bd\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax at the horizon was 4\u2019 13\u201c. But since Mars was 38\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, the longitudinal parallax corresponding to this position is 2\u2019 36\u201c, and if this be eliminated, Mars would be placed at about 13\u00b0 18\u2019 Virgo ^29. At that moment, the sun\u2019s position was 10\u00b0 16\u2019 42\u201c Pisces. The distance between the bodies was 3\u00b0 1\u2019 18\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 4\u201c, and that of Mars, 24\u2019 5\u201c (for it was 24\u2019 18\u201c at 21\u00b0 Leo in 1585, and 24\u2019 at 26 Virgo in 1587). The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 24\u2019 9\u201c. The true opposition therefore followed 2 days 3 hours 43 minutes later, on 21 February\/3 March before dawn at 2h 13m, Mars being at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 35\u201c Virgo. Forty seconds must be subtracted to reduce the position to the orbit, putting Mars at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 Virgo, with slightly less latitude than before, since the latitude was then decreasing. It was therefore about 4\u00b0 10\u2019, or 4\u00b0 7\u2153\u2019 if the parallax be neglected.\n But because, since Tycho\u2019s death, we have not made frequent observations nor continued them over several days, it would be best, for certainty\u2019s sake, also to make use of those observations which David Fabricius of East Frisia, a sedulous practitioner of astronomy, has communicated to me.\nOn February 16, old style, at 5h in the morning, he took the planet\u2019s distances from the tail of Leo (for the latitude), from the neck of Leo,30 and, on the other hand, from the bright star in the southern wing of Virgo, so as to check its longitude by working it out twice.\nI could make use of Tycho\u2019s line of reasoning, which he routinely adopted in volume I of the Progymnasmata when (as here) the declination of the planet was not known. But because that method extends to ten operations, I prefer for the sake of brevity to proceed as I did before with my own observations. Here there are no hidden dangers.\nFirst, the star in the wing of Virgo, adjusted to our time, is at 4\u00b0 36\u2019 30\u201c Libra with latitude 2\u00b0 50\u2019 north. Fabricius found that Mars is 20\u00b0 18\u2019 westward from it on the zodiac, which puts Mars at about 14\u00b0 18\u2019 30\u201c Virgo. This is a preliminary, approximate figure: the longitude will shortly be corrected. Now the tail of Leo31 is at 16\u00b0 4\u2019 Virgo, with latitude 12\u00b0 18\u2019 North, and Mars was found to be 8\u00b0 17\u2019 distant from the Tail. What is sought is the distance of its parallel from the Tail, since the difference in longitude is 1\u00b0 45\u2019. Dividing the secant of 8\u00b0 17\u2019 by the secant of 1\u00b0 45\u2019 gives the secant of 8\u00b0 6\u2019, the arc sought. This subtracted from the fixed star\u2019s northern latitude of 12\u00b0 18\u2019 leaves Mars\u2019s latitude, 4\u00b0 12\u2019 north. This I now take as determined, and compare it with the latitudes of the fixed stars according to the laws of trigonometry. From the Wing of Virgo, I find Mars\u2019s longitude to be 14\u00b0 19\u2019 Virgo; from the Neck of Leo, 14\u00b0 23\u2019 36\u201c. The mean of these two is 14\u00b0 21\u2019 18\u201c Virgo. And since the sextant gave distances larger than the truth, the latitude would come out at 4\u00b0 14\u2019 north.\nOn the night following February 23, at 12h, he observed Mars in relation to five fixed stars: the Tail of Leo and Arcturus for latitude, and for the longitude, in the first instance, Spica (which followed it), and, in the second, the Neck of Leo and Cor Leonis (which preceded it).\nBy a rough estimate, I foresee that Mars is going to fall at 11\u00bc\u00b0 Virgo. It was found to be 9\u00b0 24\u2019 from the Tail of Leo, and hence, its latitude comes out at 4\u00b0 6\u2019 ^32. And now, through this and the latitudes of the fixed stars, together with their distances (17\u00b0 26\u2019 from Regulus, 17\u00b0 51\u2019 from the Neck of Leo, 37\u00b0 28\u2019 from Spica, 44\u00b0 15\u2019 from Arcturus), Mars\u2019s position comes out at 11\u00b0 21\u2019 23\u201c Virgo (from Regulus), 11\u00b0 20\u2019 52\u201c Virgo (from the Neck of Leo), and 11\u00b0 17\u2019 40\u201c (from Spica). Again (as you see) the distances err in being too great. For from the Heart and the Neck [of Leo], Mars is pushed a little eastward, and from Spica and Arcturus a little westward, and more from Arcturus, owing to its greater northern latitude ^33. The mean (ignoring Arcturus), 11\u00b0 19\u2019 20\u201c Virgo, is very nearly true. Also, the latitude is greater, namely, 4\u00b0 7\u2019 40\u201c north. Now from February 15 at 17h to 23 February at 12h, a period of 7 days 19 hours, Mars moved 3\u00b0 0\u2019: 180 minutes in 187 hours. That is, about one minute per hour. And if you wish to take it into account, the parallax (if any) is subtracted from the longitude on February 16 and a little is added on February 23.\n Because the last observation follows the time of observation found by me by 2 days 21 hours 47 min., add the motion corresponding to this time, 1\u00b0 7\u2019: the position will come out 12\u00b0 26\u2019 Virgo. The agreement is thus very good\u2014it could not be better\u2014given that both of us [that is, Kepler and Fabricius] work independently and do not rely on the facilities used by Tycho Brahe.","1692":"VIII. On 1595 October 30 at 8h 20m, the planet was found at 17\u00b0 47\u2019 15\u201c Taurus,19 not far from the nonagesimal. We may thus be sure of the parallax, although we must take it into account. The latitude was 0\u00b0 5\u2019 10\u201c north. The sun\u2019s position was 16\u00b0 50\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio. The distance between the stars was 56\u2019 45\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 35\u201c; that of Mars, 22\u2019 54\u201c, as appears by comparing the nearby observations. The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 23\u2019 29\u201c. If the distance between the stars be divided by this, it comes out to 40\u2019 47\u201c of a day, or 16 hours 19 min. Therefore, the true opposition was 0h 39m PM on October 31. Mars\u2019s position was 17\u00b0 31\u2019 40\u201c Taurus. This needs no reduction to the orbit, as it is nearly at the node. The latitude was about 0\u00b0 8\u2019 north. But comparison with the preceding and following days shows a latitude of about 5\u2019 north.\nIX. Let, at any rate, Mars\u2019s position on 1597 December 10 at 8h 30m be 3\u00b0 45\u00bd\u2019 Cancer (as above) ^20. The sun\u2019s position was 29\u00b0 4\u2019 53\u201c Sagittarius. The distance between the stars was 4\u00b0 40\u2019 37\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 61\u2019 20\u201c, that of Mars 23\u2019 40\u201c (for in 1580 the diurnal motion in Gemini was 23\u2019, and in 1582, at 17\u00b0 Cancer, it was 24\u2019). Therefore, the sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 25\u2019 0\u201c. These data show that the time of true opposition followed 3 days 7 hours 14 min. later, on December 14 at 3h 44m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 2\u00b0 27\u2153\u2019 Cancer. The reduction to the orbit (quite ridiculous here, since the observation itself has an uncertainty of several minutes) requires the addition of about 52\u201c. Therefore, the corrected position was 2\u00b0 28\u2019 Cancer. The latitude, from the table, was 3\u00b0 33\u2019 north.\nOn the same night, the one following December 10, at 12\u2159h, Fabricius in East Frisia found Mars\u2019s position to be 3\u00b0 40\u00bc\u2019 Cancer with latitude 3\u00b0 23\u2019 N. In this observation the longitude comes out nearly the same. For the motion over 3h 40m is 3\u00bd\u2019, so that in the Brahean observation too, at 12\u2159h Mars could have been at 3\u00b0 42\u2019 Cancer\u2014two minutes beyond the Fabrician position.\nX. On 1600 January 13\/23 at 11h 40m, the time being adjusted to Uraniborg time, the planet was observed at 10\u00b0 38\u2019 46\u201c Leo ^21. The sun\u2019s position was 3\u00b0 26\u2019 30\u201c Aquarius. The stars were 7\u00b0 12\u2019 16\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion for the next few days was 1\u00b0 1\u2019 3\u201c; that of Mars, 23\u2019 44\u201c. The sum: 1\u00b0 24\u2019 47\u201c. The opposition therefore followed 5 days 2h 22m after; that is, on January 19\/29 at 2h 2m in the morning, before dawn. Mars was at 8\u00b0 38\u2019 Leo. There is no need for reduction, since it is near the limit. The latitude, from the table, was 4\u00b0 30\u2019 50\u201c N.\nXI. On the evening of 1602 Febr. 18\/28 at 10h 30m, using the Tychonic  instruments (with the help of the learned Matthias Seiffard,22 bequeathed us by Tycho), I took the distance of Mars from the middle star of the tail of Ursa Major 23 to be 52\u00b0 22\u2019. And since the distance between Cor Leonis and Procyon was 37\u00b0 22\u2019 20\u201c, which should have been 37\u00b0 19\u2019 50\u201c,24 we know that the sextant reads 2\u00bd minutes high. Therefore, the corrected distance of Mars from the tail of Ursa was 52\u00b0 19\u00bd\u2019. And since the latitude of the fixed star is 56\u00b0 22\u2019, the remainder, by subtraction, is 4\u00b0 2\u00bd\u2019\u2014supposing that Mars was at precisely the same longitude as the fixed star. But because there was a difference of 3\u00be degrees between them (as is clear from the following observations), a slight correction is required.\n For let AB be 3\u00b0 43\u2019 30\u201c on a parallel close to the ecliptic, B Mars, C the fixed star, and BC 52\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c. Dividing the secant of BC by the secant of AB gives the  secant of CA, 52\u00b0 14\u2019, which, subtracted from 56\u00b0 22\u2019 (the latitude of the fixed star) leaves 4\u00b0 8\u2019 north as Mars\u2019s observed latitude. At the same time, we found 19\u00b0 23\u2019 between Mars and Cor Leonis (19\u00b0 20\u00bd corrected), and 21\u00b0 20\u2019 between Mars and the bright star in the wing of Virgo25 (21\u00b0 17\u00bd\u2019 corrected). From these two distances (using the latitudes of the stars and Mars), Mars\u2019s longitude is found to be 13\u00b0 19\u2019 6\u201c Virgo, by consensus of all measurements.\nAlternatively, the meridian altitude of Mars was found at 12h 40m, using two quadrants, to be 50\u00b0 19\u2019, while the tail of Leo26 was 56\u00b0 45\u2019. Therefore, from the declinations and right ascensions of the fixed stars and our distances, Mars\u2019s position is determined as 13\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c Virgo, latitude 4\u00b0 7\u2019 55\u201c ^27. This is the Tychonic procedure. I have included the other for the sake of showing a consensus, and also that it might be evident that despite the lack of absolute perfection in the demonstration, short cuts either in computation or in our understanding can under certain circumstances be applied. For in that previous procedure there is less in the actual work than in the reporting of it. At Prague, 5\u00b0 Scorpio was rising ^28. Therefore, the nonagesimal was about 32\u00bd\u00b0 from the zenith. And since Mars\u2019s distance from the earth was rather more than half the sun\u2019s distance, the resulting parallax of about 5\u2019 opposite 32\u00bd\u00b0 in our parallactic table, shows a latitudinal parallax of 2\u2019 41\u201c. Thus the latitude as seen from the middle of the earth would be 4\u00b0 10\u2154\u2019 north. And because the altitude of the nonagesimal was 57\u00bd\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax at the horizon was 4\u2019 13\u201c. But since Mars was 38\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, the longitudinal parallax corresponding to this position is 2\u2019 36\u201c, and if this be eliminated, Mars would be placed at about 13\u00b0 18\u2019 Virgo ^29. At that moment, the sun\u2019s position was 10\u00b0 16\u2019 42\u201c Pisces. The distance between the bodies was 3\u00b0 1\u2019 18\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 4\u201c, and that of Mars, 24\u2019 5\u201c (for it was 24\u2019 18\u201c at 21\u00b0 Leo in 1585, and 24\u2019 at 26 Virgo in 1587). The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 24\u2019 9\u201c. The true opposition therefore followed 2 days 3 hours 43 minutes later, on 21 February\/3 March before dawn at 2h 13m, Mars being at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 35\u201c Virgo. Forty seconds must be subtracted to reduce the position to the orbit, putting Mars at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 Virgo, with slightly less latitude than before, since the latitude was then decreasing. It was therefore about 4\u00b0 10\u2019, or 4\u00b0 7\u2153\u2019 if the parallax be neglected.\n But because, since Tycho\u2019s death, we have not made frequent observations nor continued them over several days, it would be best, for certainty\u2019s sake, also to make use of those observations which David Fabricius of East Frisia, a sedulous practitioner of astronomy, has communicated to me.\nOn February 16, old style, at 5h in the morning, he took the planet\u2019s distances from the tail of Leo (for the latitude), from the neck of Leo,30 and, on the other hand, from the bright star in the southern wing of Virgo, so as to check its longitude by working it out twice.\nI could make use of Tycho\u2019s line of reasoning, which he routinely adopted in volume I of the Progymnasmata when (as here) the declination of the planet was not known. But because that method extends to ten operations, I prefer for the sake of brevity to proceed as I did before with my own observations. Here there are no hidden dangers.\nFirst, the star in the wing of Virgo, adjusted to our time, is at 4\u00b0 36\u2019 30\u201c Libra with latitude 2\u00b0 50\u2019 north. Fabricius found that Mars is 20\u00b0 18\u2019 westward from it on the zodiac, which puts Mars at about 14\u00b0 18\u2019 30\u201c Virgo. This is a preliminary, approximate figure: the longitude will shortly be corrected. Now the tail of Leo31 is at 16\u00b0 4\u2019 Virgo, with latitude 12\u00b0 18\u2019 North, and Mars was found to be 8\u00b0 17\u2019 distant from the Tail. What is sought is the distance of its parallel from the Tail, since the difference in longitude is 1\u00b0 45\u2019. Dividing the secant of 8\u00b0 17\u2019 by the secant of 1\u00b0 45\u2019 gives the secant of 8\u00b0 6\u2019, the arc sought. This subtracted from the fixed star\u2019s northern latitude of 12\u00b0 18\u2019 leaves Mars\u2019s latitude, 4\u00b0 12\u2019 north. This I now take as determined, and compare it with the latitudes of the fixed stars according to the laws of trigonometry. From the Wing of Virgo, I find Mars\u2019s longitude to be 14\u00b0 19\u2019 Virgo; from the Neck of Leo, 14\u00b0 23\u2019 36\u201c. The mean of these two is 14\u00b0 21\u2019 18\u201c Virgo. And since the sextant gave distances larger than the truth, the latitude would come out at 4\u00b0 14\u2019 north.\nOn the night following February 23, at 12h, he observed Mars in relation to five fixed stars: the Tail of Leo and Arcturus for latitude, and for the longitude, in the first instance, Spica (which followed it), and, in the second, the Neck of Leo and Cor Leonis (which preceded it).\nBy a rough estimate, I foresee that Mars is going to fall at 11\u00bc\u00b0 Virgo. It was found to be 9\u00b0 24\u2019 from the Tail of Leo, and hence, its latitude comes out at 4\u00b0 6\u2019 ^32. And now, through this and the latitudes of the fixed stars, together with their distances (17\u00b0 26\u2019 from Regulus, 17\u00b0 51\u2019 from the Neck of Leo, 37\u00b0 28\u2019 from Spica, 44\u00b0 15\u2019 from Arcturus), Mars\u2019s position comes out at 11\u00b0 21\u2019 23\u201c Virgo (from Regulus), 11\u00b0 20\u2019 52\u201c Virgo (from the Neck of Leo), and 11\u00b0 17\u2019 40\u201c (from Spica). Again (as you see) the distances err in being too great. For from the Heart and the Neck [of Leo], Mars is pushed a little eastward, and from Spica and Arcturus a little westward, and more from Arcturus, owing to its greater northern latitude ^33. The mean (ignoring Arcturus), 11\u00b0 19\u2019 20\u201c Virgo, is very nearly true. Also, the latitude is greater, namely, 4\u00b0 7\u2019 40\u201c north. Now from February 15 at 17h to 23 February at 12h, a period of 7 days 19 hours, Mars moved 3\u00b0 0\u2019: 180 minutes in 187 hours. That is, about one minute per hour. And if you wish to take it into account, the parallax (if any) is subtracted from the longitude on February 16 and a little is added on February 23.\n Because the last observation follows the time of observation found by me by 2 days 21 hours 47 min., add the motion corresponding to this time, 1\u00b0 7\u2019: the position will come out 12\u00b0 26\u2019 Virgo. The agreement is thus very good\u2014it could not be better\u2014given that both of us [that is, Kepler and Fabricius] work independently and do not rely on the facilities used by Tycho Brahe.","1693":"VIII. On 1595 October 30 at 8h 20m, the planet was found at 17\u00b0 47\u2019 15\u201c Taurus,19 not far from the nonagesimal. We may thus be sure of the parallax, although we must take it into account. The latitude was 0\u00b0 5\u2019 10\u201c north. The sun\u2019s position was 16\u00b0 50\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio. The distance between the stars was 56\u2019 45\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 35\u201c; that of Mars, 22\u2019 54\u201c, as appears by comparing the nearby observations. The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 23\u2019 29\u201c. If the distance between the stars be divided by this, it comes out to 40\u2019 47\u201c of a day, or 16 hours 19 min. Therefore, the true opposition was 0h 39m PM on October 31. Mars\u2019s position was 17\u00b0 31\u2019 40\u201c Taurus. This needs no reduction to the orbit, as it is nearly at the node. The latitude was about 0\u00b0 8\u2019 north. But comparison with the preceding and following days shows a latitude of about 5\u2019 north.\nIX. Let, at any rate, Mars\u2019s position on 1597 December 10 at 8h 30m be 3\u00b0 45\u00bd\u2019 Cancer (as above) ^20. The sun\u2019s position was 29\u00b0 4\u2019 53\u201c Sagittarius. The distance between the stars was 4\u00b0 40\u2019 37\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 61\u2019 20\u201c, that of Mars 23\u2019 40\u201c (for in 1580 the diurnal motion in Gemini was 23\u2019, and in 1582, at 17\u00b0 Cancer, it was 24\u2019). Therefore, the sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 25\u2019 0\u201c. These data show that the time of true opposition followed 3 days 7 hours 14 min. later, on December 14 at 3h 44m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 2\u00b0 27\u2153\u2019 Cancer. The reduction to the orbit (quite ridiculous here, since the observation itself has an uncertainty of several minutes) requires the addition of about 52\u201c. Therefore, the corrected position was 2\u00b0 28\u2019 Cancer. The latitude, from the table, was 3\u00b0 33\u2019 north.\nOn the same night, the one following December 10, at 12\u2159h, Fabricius in East Frisia found Mars\u2019s position to be 3\u00b0 40\u00bc\u2019 Cancer with latitude 3\u00b0 23\u2019 N. In this observation the longitude comes out nearly the same. For the motion over 3h 40m is 3\u00bd\u2019, so that in the Brahean observation too, at 12\u2159h Mars could have been at 3\u00b0 42\u2019 Cancer\u2014two minutes beyond the Fabrician position.\nX. On 1600 January 13\/23 at 11h 40m, the time being adjusted to Uraniborg time, the planet was observed at 10\u00b0 38\u2019 46\u201c Leo ^21. The sun\u2019s position was 3\u00b0 26\u2019 30\u201c Aquarius. The stars were 7\u00b0 12\u2019 16\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion for the next few days was 1\u00b0 1\u2019 3\u201c; that of Mars, 23\u2019 44\u201c. The sum: 1\u00b0 24\u2019 47\u201c. The opposition therefore followed 5 days 2h 22m after; that is, on January 19\/29 at 2h 2m in the morning, before dawn. Mars was at 8\u00b0 38\u2019 Leo. There is no need for reduction, since it is near the limit. The latitude, from the table, was 4\u00b0 30\u2019 50\u201c N.\nXI. On the evening of 1602 Febr. 18\/28 at 10h 30m, using the Tychonic  instruments (with the help of the learned Matthias Seiffard,22 bequeathed us by Tycho), I took the distance of Mars from the middle star of the tail of Ursa Major 23 to be 52\u00b0 22\u2019. And since the distance between Cor Leonis and Procyon was 37\u00b0 22\u2019 20\u201c, which should have been 37\u00b0 19\u2019 50\u201c,24 we know that the sextant reads 2\u00bd minutes high. Therefore, the corrected distance of Mars from the tail of Ursa was 52\u00b0 19\u00bd\u2019. And since the latitude of the fixed star is 56\u00b0 22\u2019, the remainder, by subtraction, is 4\u00b0 2\u00bd\u2019\u2014supposing that Mars was at precisely the same longitude as the fixed star. But because there was a difference of 3\u00be degrees between them (as is clear from the following observations), a slight correction is required.\n For let AB be 3\u00b0 43\u2019 30\u201c on a parallel close to the ecliptic, B Mars, C the fixed star, and BC 52\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c. Dividing the secant of BC by the secant of AB gives the  secant of CA, 52\u00b0 14\u2019, which, subtracted from 56\u00b0 22\u2019 (the latitude of the fixed star) leaves 4\u00b0 8\u2019 north as Mars\u2019s observed latitude. At the same time, we found 19\u00b0 23\u2019 between Mars and Cor Leonis (19\u00b0 20\u00bd corrected), and 21\u00b0 20\u2019 between Mars and the bright star in the wing of Virgo25 (21\u00b0 17\u00bd\u2019 corrected). From these two distances (using the latitudes of the stars and Mars), Mars\u2019s longitude is found to be 13\u00b0 19\u2019 6\u201c Virgo, by consensus of all measurements.\nAlternatively, the meridian altitude of Mars was found at 12h 40m, using two quadrants, to be 50\u00b0 19\u2019, while the tail of Leo26 was 56\u00b0 45\u2019. Therefore, from the declinations and right ascensions of the fixed stars and our distances, Mars\u2019s position is determined as 13\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c Virgo, latitude 4\u00b0 7\u2019 55\u201c ^27. This is the Tychonic procedure. I have included the other for the sake of showing a consensus, and also that it might be evident that despite the lack of absolute perfection in the demonstration, short cuts either in computation or in our understanding can under certain circumstances be applied. For in that previous procedure there is less in the actual work than in the reporting of it. At Prague, 5\u00b0 Scorpio was rising ^28. Therefore, the nonagesimal was about 32\u00bd\u00b0 from the zenith. And since Mars\u2019s distance from the earth was rather more than half the sun\u2019s distance, the resulting parallax of about 5\u2019 opposite 32\u00bd\u00b0 in our parallactic table, shows a latitudinal parallax of 2\u2019 41\u201c. Thus the latitude as seen from the middle of the earth would be 4\u00b0 10\u2154\u2019 north. And because the altitude of the nonagesimal was 57\u00bd\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax at the horizon was 4\u2019 13\u201c. But since Mars was 38\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, the longitudinal parallax corresponding to this position is 2\u2019 36\u201c, and if this be eliminated, Mars would be placed at about 13\u00b0 18\u2019 Virgo ^29. At that moment, the sun\u2019s position was 10\u00b0 16\u2019 42\u201c Pisces. The distance between the bodies was 3\u00b0 1\u2019 18\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 4\u201c, and that of Mars, 24\u2019 5\u201c (for it was 24\u2019 18\u201c at 21\u00b0 Leo in 1585, and 24\u2019 at 26 Virgo in 1587). The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 24\u2019 9\u201c. The true opposition therefore followed 2 days 3 hours 43 minutes later, on 21 February\/3 March before dawn at 2h 13m, Mars being at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 35\u201c Virgo. Forty seconds must be subtracted to reduce the position to the orbit, putting Mars at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 Virgo, with slightly less latitude than before, since the latitude was then decreasing. It was therefore about 4\u00b0 10\u2019, or 4\u00b0 7\u2153\u2019 if the parallax be neglected.\n But because, since Tycho\u2019s death, we have not made frequent observations nor continued them over several days, it would be best, for certainty\u2019s sake, also to make use of those observations which David Fabricius of East Frisia, a sedulous practitioner of astronomy, has communicated to me.\nOn February 16, old style, at 5h in the morning, he took the planet\u2019s distances from the tail of Leo (for the latitude), from the neck of Leo,30 and, on the other hand, from the bright star in the southern wing of Virgo, so as to check its longitude by working it out twice.\nI could make use of Tycho\u2019s line of reasoning, which he routinely adopted in volume I of the Progymnasmata when (as here) the declination of the planet was not known. But because that method extends to ten operations, I prefer for the sake of brevity to proceed as I did before with my own observations. Here there are no hidden dangers.\nFirst, the star in the wing of Virgo, adjusted to our time, is at 4\u00b0 36\u2019 30\u201c Libra with latitude 2\u00b0 50\u2019 north. Fabricius found that Mars is 20\u00b0 18\u2019 westward from it on the zodiac, which puts Mars at about 14\u00b0 18\u2019 30\u201c Virgo. This is a preliminary, approximate figure: the longitude will shortly be corrected. Now the tail of Leo31 is at 16\u00b0 4\u2019 Virgo, with latitude 12\u00b0 18\u2019 North, and Mars was found to be 8\u00b0 17\u2019 distant from the Tail. What is sought is the distance of its parallel from the Tail, since the difference in longitude is 1\u00b0 45\u2019. Dividing the secant of 8\u00b0 17\u2019 by the secant of 1\u00b0 45\u2019 gives the secant of 8\u00b0 6\u2019, the arc sought. This subtracted from the fixed star\u2019s northern latitude of 12\u00b0 18\u2019 leaves Mars\u2019s latitude, 4\u00b0 12\u2019 north. This I now take as determined, and compare it with the latitudes of the fixed stars according to the laws of trigonometry. From the Wing of Virgo, I find Mars\u2019s longitude to be 14\u00b0 19\u2019 Virgo; from the Neck of Leo, 14\u00b0 23\u2019 36\u201c. The mean of these two is 14\u00b0 21\u2019 18\u201c Virgo. And since the sextant gave distances larger than the truth, the latitude would come out at 4\u00b0 14\u2019 north.\nOn the night following February 23, at 12h, he observed Mars in relation to five fixed stars: the Tail of Leo and Arcturus for latitude, and for the longitude, in the first instance, Spica (which followed it), and, in the second, the Neck of Leo and Cor Leonis (which preceded it).\nBy a rough estimate, I foresee that Mars is going to fall at 11\u00bc\u00b0 Virgo. It was found to be 9\u00b0 24\u2019 from the Tail of Leo, and hence, its latitude comes out at 4\u00b0 6\u2019 ^32. And now, through this and the latitudes of the fixed stars, together with their distances (17\u00b0 26\u2019 from Regulus, 17\u00b0 51\u2019 from the Neck of Leo, 37\u00b0 28\u2019 from Spica, 44\u00b0 15\u2019 from Arcturus), Mars\u2019s position comes out at 11\u00b0 21\u2019 23\u201c Virgo (from Regulus), 11\u00b0 20\u2019 52\u201c Virgo (from the Neck of Leo), and 11\u00b0 17\u2019 40\u201c (from Spica). Again (as you see) the distances err in being too great. For from the Heart and the Neck [of Leo], Mars is pushed a little eastward, and from Spica and Arcturus a little westward, and more from Arcturus, owing to its greater northern latitude ^33. The mean (ignoring Arcturus), 11\u00b0 19\u2019 20\u201c Virgo, is very nearly true. Also, the latitude is greater, namely, 4\u00b0 7\u2019 40\u201c north. Now from February 15 at 17h to 23 February at 12h, a period of 7 days 19 hours, Mars moved 3\u00b0 0\u2019: 180 minutes in 187 hours. That is, about one minute per hour. And if you wish to take it into account, the parallax (if any) is subtracted from the longitude on February 16 and a little is added on February 23.\n Because the last observation follows the time of observation found by me by 2 days 21 hours 47 min., add the motion corresponding to this time, 1\u00b0 7\u2019: the position will come out 12\u00b0 26\u2019 Virgo. The agreement is thus very good\u2014it could not be better\u2014given that both of us [that is, Kepler and Fabricius] work independently and do not rely on the facilities used by Tycho Brahe.","1694":"VIII. On 1595 October 30 at 8h 20m, the planet was found at 17\u00b0 47\u2019 15\u201c Taurus,19 not far from the nonagesimal. We may thus be sure of the parallax, although we must take it into account. The latitude was 0\u00b0 5\u2019 10\u201c north. The sun\u2019s position was 16\u00b0 50\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio. The distance between the stars was 56\u2019 45\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 35\u201c; that of Mars, 22\u2019 54\u201c, as appears by comparing the nearby observations. The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 23\u2019 29\u201c. If the distance between the stars be divided by this, it comes out to 40\u2019 47\u201c of a day, or 16 hours 19 min. Therefore, the true opposition was 0h 39m PM on October 31. Mars\u2019s position was 17\u00b0 31\u2019 40\u201c Taurus. This needs no reduction to the orbit, as it is nearly at the node. The latitude was about 0\u00b0 8\u2019 north. But comparison with the preceding and following days shows a latitude of about 5\u2019 north.\nIX. Let, at any rate, Mars\u2019s position on 1597 December 10 at 8h 30m be 3\u00b0 45\u00bd\u2019 Cancer (as above) ^20. The sun\u2019s position was 29\u00b0 4\u2019 53\u201c Sagittarius. The distance between the stars was 4\u00b0 40\u2019 37\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 61\u2019 20\u201c, that of Mars 23\u2019 40\u201c (for in 1580 the diurnal motion in Gemini was 23\u2019, and in 1582, at 17\u00b0 Cancer, it was 24\u2019). Therefore, the sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 25\u2019 0\u201c. These data show that the time of true opposition followed 3 days 7 hours 14 min. later, on December 14 at 3h 44m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 2\u00b0 27\u2153\u2019 Cancer. The reduction to the orbit (quite ridiculous here, since the observation itself has an uncertainty of several minutes) requires the addition of about 52\u201c. Therefore, the corrected position was 2\u00b0 28\u2019 Cancer. The latitude, from the table, was 3\u00b0 33\u2019 north.\nOn the same night, the one following December 10, at 12\u2159h, Fabricius in East Frisia found Mars\u2019s position to be 3\u00b0 40\u00bc\u2019 Cancer with latitude 3\u00b0 23\u2019 N. In this observation the longitude comes out nearly the same. For the motion over 3h 40m is 3\u00bd\u2019, so that in the Brahean observation too, at 12\u2159h Mars could have been at 3\u00b0 42\u2019 Cancer\u2014two minutes beyond the Fabrician position.\nX. On 1600 January 13\/23 at 11h 40m, the time being adjusted to Uraniborg time, the planet was observed at 10\u00b0 38\u2019 46\u201c Leo ^21. The sun\u2019s position was 3\u00b0 26\u2019 30\u201c Aquarius. The stars were 7\u00b0 12\u2019 16\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion for the next few days was 1\u00b0 1\u2019 3\u201c; that of Mars, 23\u2019 44\u201c. The sum: 1\u00b0 24\u2019 47\u201c. The opposition therefore followed 5 days 2h 22m after; that is, on January 19\/29 at 2h 2m in the morning, before dawn. Mars was at 8\u00b0 38\u2019 Leo. There is no need for reduction, since it is near the limit. The latitude, from the table, was 4\u00b0 30\u2019 50\u201c N.\nXI. On the evening of 1602 Febr. 18\/28 at 10h 30m, using the Tychonic  instruments (with the help of the learned Matthias Seiffard,22 bequeathed us by Tycho), I took the distance of Mars from the middle star of the tail of Ursa Major 23 to be 52\u00b0 22\u2019. And since the distance between Cor Leonis and Procyon was 37\u00b0 22\u2019 20\u201c, which should have been 37\u00b0 19\u2019 50\u201c,24 we know that the sextant reads 2\u00bd minutes high. Therefore, the corrected distance of Mars from the tail of Ursa was 52\u00b0 19\u00bd\u2019. And since the latitude of the fixed star is 56\u00b0 22\u2019, the remainder, by subtraction, is 4\u00b0 2\u00bd\u2019\u2014supposing that Mars was at precisely the same longitude as the fixed star. But because there was a difference of 3\u00be degrees between them (as is clear from the following observations), a slight correction is required.\n For let AB be 3\u00b0 43\u2019 30\u201c on a parallel close to the ecliptic, B Mars, C the fixed star, and BC 52\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c. Dividing the secant of BC by the secant of AB gives the  secant of CA, 52\u00b0 14\u2019, which, subtracted from 56\u00b0 22\u2019 (the latitude of the fixed star) leaves 4\u00b0 8\u2019 north as Mars\u2019s observed latitude. At the same time, we found 19\u00b0 23\u2019 between Mars and Cor Leonis (19\u00b0 20\u00bd corrected), and 21\u00b0 20\u2019 between Mars and the bright star in the wing of Virgo25 (21\u00b0 17\u00bd\u2019 corrected). From these two distances (using the latitudes of the stars and Mars), Mars\u2019s longitude is found to be 13\u00b0 19\u2019 6\u201c Virgo, by consensus of all measurements.\nAlternatively, the meridian altitude of Mars was found at 12h 40m, using two quadrants, to be 50\u00b0 19\u2019, while the tail of Leo26 was 56\u00b0 45\u2019. Therefore, from the declinations and right ascensions of the fixed stars and our distances, Mars\u2019s position is determined as 13\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c Virgo, latitude 4\u00b0 7\u2019 55\u201c ^27. This is the Tychonic procedure. I have included the other for the sake of showing a consensus, and also that it might be evident that despite the lack of absolute perfection in the demonstration, short cuts either in computation or in our understanding can under certain circumstances be applied. For in that previous procedure there is less in the actual work than in the reporting of it. At Prague, 5\u00b0 Scorpio was rising ^28. Therefore, the nonagesimal was about 32\u00bd\u00b0 from the zenith. And since Mars\u2019s distance from the earth was rather more than half the sun\u2019s distance, the resulting parallax of about 5\u2019 opposite 32\u00bd\u00b0 in our parallactic table, shows a latitudinal parallax of 2\u2019 41\u201c. Thus the latitude as seen from the middle of the earth would be 4\u00b0 10\u2154\u2019 north. And because the altitude of the nonagesimal was 57\u00bd\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax at the horizon was 4\u2019 13\u201c. But since Mars was 38\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, the longitudinal parallax corresponding to this position is 2\u2019 36\u201c, and if this be eliminated, Mars would be placed at about 13\u00b0 18\u2019 Virgo ^29. At that moment, the sun\u2019s position was 10\u00b0 16\u2019 42\u201c Pisces. The distance between the bodies was 3\u00b0 1\u2019 18\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 4\u201c, and that of Mars, 24\u2019 5\u201c (for it was 24\u2019 18\u201c at 21\u00b0 Leo in 1585, and 24\u2019 at 26 Virgo in 1587). The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 24\u2019 9\u201c. The true opposition therefore followed 2 days 3 hours 43 minutes later, on 21 February\/3 March before dawn at 2h 13m, Mars being at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 35\u201c Virgo. Forty seconds must be subtracted to reduce the position to the orbit, putting Mars at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 Virgo, with slightly less latitude than before, since the latitude was then decreasing. It was therefore about 4\u00b0 10\u2019, or 4\u00b0 7\u2153\u2019 if the parallax be neglected.\n But because, since Tycho\u2019s death, we have not made frequent observations nor continued them over several days, it would be best, for certainty\u2019s sake, also to make use of those observations which David Fabricius of East Frisia, a sedulous practitioner of astronomy, has communicated to me.\nOn February 16, old style, at 5h in the morning, he took the planet\u2019s distances from the tail of Leo (for the latitude), from the neck of Leo,30 and, on the other hand, from the bright star in the southern wing of Virgo, so as to check its longitude by working it out twice.\nI could make use of Tycho\u2019s line of reasoning, which he routinely adopted in volume I of the Progymnasmata when (as here) the declination of the planet was not known. But because that method extends to ten operations, I prefer for the sake of brevity to proceed as I did before with my own observations. Here there are no hidden dangers.\nFirst, the star in the wing of Virgo, adjusted to our time, is at 4\u00b0 36\u2019 30\u201c Libra with latitude 2\u00b0 50\u2019 north. Fabricius found that Mars is 20\u00b0 18\u2019 westward from it on the zodiac, which puts Mars at about 14\u00b0 18\u2019 30\u201c Virgo. This is a preliminary, approximate figure: the longitude will shortly be corrected. Now the tail of Leo31 is at 16\u00b0 4\u2019 Virgo, with latitude 12\u00b0 18\u2019 North, and Mars was found to be 8\u00b0 17\u2019 distant from the Tail. What is sought is the distance of its parallel from the Tail, since the difference in longitude is 1\u00b0 45\u2019. Dividing the secant of 8\u00b0 17\u2019 by the secant of 1\u00b0 45\u2019 gives the secant of 8\u00b0 6\u2019, the arc sought. This subtracted from the fixed star\u2019s northern latitude of 12\u00b0 18\u2019 leaves Mars\u2019s latitude, 4\u00b0 12\u2019 north. This I now take as determined, and compare it with the latitudes of the fixed stars according to the laws of trigonometry. From the Wing of Virgo, I find Mars\u2019s longitude to be 14\u00b0 19\u2019 Virgo; from the Neck of Leo, 14\u00b0 23\u2019 36\u201c. The mean of these two is 14\u00b0 21\u2019 18\u201c Virgo. And since the sextant gave distances larger than the truth, the latitude would come out at 4\u00b0 14\u2019 north.\nOn the night following February 23, at 12h, he observed Mars in relation to five fixed stars: the Tail of Leo and Arcturus for latitude, and for the longitude, in the first instance, Spica (which followed it), and, in the second, the Neck of Leo and Cor Leonis (which preceded it).\nBy a rough estimate, I foresee that Mars is going to fall at 11\u00bc\u00b0 Virgo. It was found to be 9\u00b0 24\u2019 from the Tail of Leo, and hence, its latitude comes out at 4\u00b0 6\u2019 ^32. And now, through this and the latitudes of the fixed stars, together with their distances (17\u00b0 26\u2019 from Regulus, 17\u00b0 51\u2019 from the Neck of Leo, 37\u00b0 28\u2019 from Spica, 44\u00b0 15\u2019 from Arcturus), Mars\u2019s position comes out at 11\u00b0 21\u2019 23\u201c Virgo (from Regulus), 11\u00b0 20\u2019 52\u201c Virgo (from the Neck of Leo), and 11\u00b0 17\u2019 40\u201c (from Spica). Again (as you see) the distances err in being too great. For from the Heart and the Neck [of Leo], Mars is pushed a little eastward, and from Spica and Arcturus a little westward, and more from Arcturus, owing to its greater northern latitude ^33. The mean (ignoring Arcturus), 11\u00b0 19\u2019 20\u201c Virgo, is very nearly true. Also, the latitude is greater, namely, 4\u00b0 7\u2019 40\u201c north. Now from February 15 at 17h to 23 February at 12h, a period of 7 days 19 hours, Mars moved 3\u00b0 0\u2019: 180 minutes in 187 hours. That is, about one minute per hour. And if you wish to take it into account, the parallax (if any) is subtracted from the longitude on February 16 and a little is added on February 23.\n Because the last observation follows the time of observation found by me by 2 days 21 hours 47 min., add the motion corresponding to this time, 1\u00b0 7\u2019: the position will come out 12\u00b0 26\u2019 Virgo. The agreement is thus very good\u2014it could not be better\u2014given that both of us [that is, Kepler and Fabricius] work independently and do not rely on the facilities used by Tycho Brahe.","1695":"VIII. On 1595 October 30 at 8h 20m, the planet was found at 17\u00b0 47\u2019 15\u201c Taurus,19 not far from the nonagesimal. We may thus be sure of the parallax, although we must take it into account. The latitude was 0\u00b0 5\u2019 10\u201c north. The sun\u2019s position was 16\u00b0 50\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio. The distance between the stars was 56\u2019 45\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 35\u201c; that of Mars, 22\u2019 54\u201c, as appears by comparing the nearby observations. The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 23\u2019 29\u201c. If the distance between the stars be divided by this, it comes out to 40\u2019 47\u201c of a day, or 16 hours 19 min. Therefore, the true opposition was 0h 39m PM on October 31. Mars\u2019s position was 17\u00b0 31\u2019 40\u201c Taurus. This needs no reduction to the orbit, as it is nearly at the node. The latitude was about 0\u00b0 8\u2019 north. But comparison with the preceding and following days shows a latitude of about 5\u2019 north.\nIX. Let, at any rate, Mars\u2019s position on 1597 December 10 at 8h 30m be 3\u00b0 45\u00bd\u2019 Cancer (as above) ^20. The sun\u2019s position was 29\u00b0 4\u2019 53\u201c Sagittarius. The distance between the stars was 4\u00b0 40\u2019 37\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 61\u2019 20\u201c, that of Mars 23\u2019 40\u201c (for in 1580 the diurnal motion in Gemini was 23\u2019, and in 1582, at 17\u00b0 Cancer, it was 24\u2019). Therefore, the sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 25\u2019 0\u201c. These data show that the time of true opposition followed 3 days 7 hours 14 min. later, on December 14 at 3h 44m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 2\u00b0 27\u2153\u2019 Cancer. The reduction to the orbit (quite ridiculous here, since the observation itself has an uncertainty of several minutes) requires the addition of about 52\u201c. Therefore, the corrected position was 2\u00b0 28\u2019 Cancer. The latitude, from the table, was 3\u00b0 33\u2019 north.\nOn the same night, the one following December 10, at 12\u2159h, Fabricius in East Frisia found Mars\u2019s position to be 3\u00b0 40\u00bc\u2019 Cancer with latitude 3\u00b0 23\u2019 N. In this observation the longitude comes out nearly the same. For the motion over 3h 40m is 3\u00bd\u2019, so that in the Brahean observation too, at 12\u2159h Mars could have been at 3\u00b0 42\u2019 Cancer\u2014two minutes beyond the Fabrician position.\nX. On 1600 January 13\/23 at 11h 40m, the time being adjusted to Uraniborg time, the planet was observed at 10\u00b0 38\u2019 46\u201c Leo ^21. The sun\u2019s position was 3\u00b0 26\u2019 30\u201c Aquarius. The stars were 7\u00b0 12\u2019 16\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion for the next few days was 1\u00b0 1\u2019 3\u201c; that of Mars, 23\u2019 44\u201c. The sum: 1\u00b0 24\u2019 47\u201c. The opposition therefore followed 5 days 2h 22m after; that is, on January 19\/29 at 2h 2m in the morning, before dawn. Mars was at 8\u00b0 38\u2019 Leo. There is no need for reduction, since it is near the limit. The latitude, from the table, was 4\u00b0 30\u2019 50\u201c N.\nXI. On the evening of 1602 Febr. 18\/28 at 10h 30m, using the Tychonic  instruments (with the help of the learned Matthias Seiffard,22 bequeathed us by Tycho), I took the distance of Mars from the middle star of the tail of Ursa Major 23 to be 52\u00b0 22\u2019. And since the distance between Cor Leonis and Procyon was 37\u00b0 22\u2019 20\u201c, which should have been 37\u00b0 19\u2019 50\u201c,24 we know that the sextant reads 2\u00bd minutes high. Therefore, the corrected distance of Mars from the tail of Ursa was 52\u00b0 19\u00bd\u2019. And since the latitude of the fixed star is 56\u00b0 22\u2019, the remainder, by subtraction, is 4\u00b0 2\u00bd\u2019\u2014supposing that Mars was at precisely the same longitude as the fixed star. But because there was a difference of 3\u00be degrees between them (as is clear from the following observations), a slight correction is required.\n For let AB be 3\u00b0 43\u2019 30\u201c on a parallel close to the ecliptic, B Mars, C the fixed star, and BC 52\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c. Dividing the secant of BC by the secant of AB gives the  secant of CA, 52\u00b0 14\u2019, which, subtracted from 56\u00b0 22\u2019 (the latitude of the fixed star) leaves 4\u00b0 8\u2019 north as Mars\u2019s observed latitude. At the same time, we found 19\u00b0 23\u2019 between Mars and Cor Leonis (19\u00b0 20\u00bd corrected), and 21\u00b0 20\u2019 between Mars and the bright star in the wing of Virgo25 (21\u00b0 17\u00bd\u2019 corrected). From these two distances (using the latitudes of the stars and Mars), Mars\u2019s longitude is found to be 13\u00b0 19\u2019 6\u201c Virgo, by consensus of all measurements.\nAlternatively, the meridian altitude of Mars was found at 12h 40m, using two quadrants, to be 50\u00b0 19\u2019, while the tail of Leo26 was 56\u00b0 45\u2019. Therefore, from the declinations and right ascensions of the fixed stars and our distances, Mars\u2019s position is determined as 13\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c Virgo, latitude 4\u00b0 7\u2019 55\u201c ^27. This is the Tychonic procedure. I have included the other for the sake of showing a consensus, and also that it might be evident that despite the lack of absolute perfection in the demonstration, short cuts either in computation or in our understanding can under certain circumstances be applied. For in that previous procedure there is less in the actual work than in the reporting of it. At Prague, 5\u00b0 Scorpio was rising ^28. Therefore, the nonagesimal was about 32\u00bd\u00b0 from the zenith. And since Mars\u2019s distance from the earth was rather more than half the sun\u2019s distance, the resulting parallax of about 5\u2019 opposite 32\u00bd\u00b0 in our parallactic table, shows a latitudinal parallax of 2\u2019 41\u201c. Thus the latitude as seen from the middle of the earth would be 4\u00b0 10\u2154\u2019 north. And because the altitude of the nonagesimal was 57\u00bd\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax at the horizon was 4\u2019 13\u201c. But since Mars was 38\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, the longitudinal parallax corresponding to this position is 2\u2019 36\u201c, and if this be eliminated, Mars would be placed at about 13\u00b0 18\u2019 Virgo ^29. At that moment, the sun\u2019s position was 10\u00b0 16\u2019 42\u201c Pisces. The distance between the bodies was 3\u00b0 1\u2019 18\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 4\u201c, and that of Mars, 24\u2019 5\u201c (for it was 24\u2019 18\u201c at 21\u00b0 Leo in 1585, and 24\u2019 at 26 Virgo in 1587). The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 24\u2019 9\u201c. The true opposition therefore followed 2 days 3 hours 43 minutes later, on 21 February\/3 March before dawn at 2h 13m, Mars being at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 35\u201c Virgo. Forty seconds must be subtracted to reduce the position to the orbit, putting Mars at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 Virgo, with slightly less latitude than before, since the latitude was then decreasing. It was therefore about 4\u00b0 10\u2019, or 4\u00b0 7\u2153\u2019 if the parallax be neglected.\n But because, since Tycho\u2019s death, we have not made frequent observations nor continued them over several days, it would be best, for certainty\u2019s sake, also to make use of those observations which David Fabricius of East Frisia, a sedulous practitioner of astronomy, has communicated to me.\nOn February 16, old style, at 5h in the morning, he took the planet\u2019s distances from the tail of Leo (for the latitude), from the neck of Leo,30 and, on the other hand, from the bright star in the southern wing of Virgo, so as to check its longitude by working it out twice.\nI could make use of Tycho\u2019s line of reasoning, which he routinely adopted in volume I of the Progymnasmata when (as here) the declination of the planet was not known. But because that method extends to ten operations, I prefer for the sake of brevity to proceed as I did before with my own observations. Here there are no hidden dangers.\nFirst, the star in the wing of Virgo, adjusted to our time, is at 4\u00b0 36\u2019 30\u201c Libra with latitude 2\u00b0 50\u2019 north. Fabricius found that Mars is 20\u00b0 18\u2019 westward from it on the zodiac, which puts Mars at about 14\u00b0 18\u2019 30\u201c Virgo. This is a preliminary, approximate figure: the longitude will shortly be corrected. Now the tail of Leo31 is at 16\u00b0 4\u2019 Virgo, with latitude 12\u00b0 18\u2019 North, and Mars was found to be 8\u00b0 17\u2019 distant from the Tail. What is sought is the distance of its parallel from the Tail, since the difference in longitude is 1\u00b0 45\u2019. Dividing the secant of 8\u00b0 17\u2019 by the secant of 1\u00b0 45\u2019 gives the secant of 8\u00b0 6\u2019, the arc sought. This subtracted from the fixed star\u2019s northern latitude of 12\u00b0 18\u2019 leaves Mars\u2019s latitude, 4\u00b0 12\u2019 north. This I now take as determined, and compare it with the latitudes of the fixed stars according to the laws of trigonometry. From the Wing of Virgo, I find Mars\u2019s longitude to be 14\u00b0 19\u2019 Virgo; from the Neck of Leo, 14\u00b0 23\u2019 36\u201c. The mean of these two is 14\u00b0 21\u2019 18\u201c Virgo. And since the sextant gave distances larger than the truth, the latitude would come out at 4\u00b0 14\u2019 north.\nOn the night following February 23, at 12h, he observed Mars in relation to five fixed stars: the Tail of Leo and Arcturus for latitude, and for the longitude, in the first instance, Spica (which followed it), and, in the second, the Neck of Leo and Cor Leonis (which preceded it).\nBy a rough estimate, I foresee that Mars is going to fall at 11\u00bc\u00b0 Virgo. It was found to be 9\u00b0 24\u2019 from the Tail of Leo, and hence, its latitude comes out at 4\u00b0 6\u2019 ^32. And now, through this and the latitudes of the fixed stars, together with their distances (17\u00b0 26\u2019 from Regulus, 17\u00b0 51\u2019 from the Neck of Leo, 37\u00b0 28\u2019 from Spica, 44\u00b0 15\u2019 from Arcturus), Mars\u2019s position comes out at 11\u00b0 21\u2019 23\u201c Virgo (from Regulus), 11\u00b0 20\u2019 52\u201c Virgo (from the Neck of Leo), and 11\u00b0 17\u2019 40\u201c (from Spica). Again (as you see) the distances err in being too great. For from the Heart and the Neck [of Leo], Mars is pushed a little eastward, and from Spica and Arcturus a little westward, and more from Arcturus, owing to its greater northern latitude ^33. The mean (ignoring Arcturus), 11\u00b0 19\u2019 20\u201c Virgo, is very nearly true. Also, the latitude is greater, namely, 4\u00b0 7\u2019 40\u201c north. Now from February 15 at 17h to 23 February at 12h, a period of 7 days 19 hours, Mars moved 3\u00b0 0\u2019: 180 minutes in 187 hours. That is, about one minute per hour. And if you wish to take it into account, the parallax (if any) is subtracted from the longitude on February 16 and a little is added on February 23.\n Because the last observation follows the time of observation found by me by 2 days 21 hours 47 min., add the motion corresponding to this time, 1\u00b0 7\u2019: the position will come out 12\u00b0 26\u2019 Virgo. The agreement is thus very good\u2014it could not be better\u2014given that both of us [that is, Kepler and Fabricius] work independently and do not rely on the facilities used by Tycho Brahe.","1696":"VIII. On 1595 October 30 at 8h 20m, the planet was found at 17\u00b0 47\u2019 15\u201c Taurus,19 not far from the nonagesimal. We may thus be sure of the parallax, although we must take it into account. The latitude was 0\u00b0 5\u2019 10\u201c north. The sun\u2019s position was 16\u00b0 50\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio. The distance between the stars was 56\u2019 45\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 35\u201c; that of Mars, 22\u2019 54\u201c, as appears by comparing the nearby observations. The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 23\u2019 29\u201c. If the distance between the stars be divided by this, it comes out to 40\u2019 47\u201c of a day, or 16 hours 19 min. Therefore, the true opposition was 0h 39m PM on October 31. Mars\u2019s position was 17\u00b0 31\u2019 40\u201c Taurus. This needs no reduction to the orbit, as it is nearly at the node. The latitude was about 0\u00b0 8\u2019 north. But comparison with the preceding and following days shows a latitude of about 5\u2019 north.\nIX. Let, at any rate, Mars\u2019s position on 1597 December 10 at 8h 30m be 3\u00b0 45\u00bd\u2019 Cancer (as above) ^20. The sun\u2019s position was 29\u00b0 4\u2019 53\u201c Sagittarius. The distance between the stars was 4\u00b0 40\u2019 37\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 61\u2019 20\u201c, that of Mars 23\u2019 40\u201c (for in 1580 the diurnal motion in Gemini was 23\u2019, and in 1582, at 17\u00b0 Cancer, it was 24\u2019). Therefore, the sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 25\u2019 0\u201c. These data show that the time of true opposition followed 3 days 7 hours 14 min. later, on December 14 at 3h 44m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 2\u00b0 27\u2153\u2019 Cancer. The reduction to the orbit (quite ridiculous here, since the observation itself has an uncertainty of several minutes) requires the addition of about 52\u201c. Therefore, the corrected position was 2\u00b0 28\u2019 Cancer. The latitude, from the table, was 3\u00b0 33\u2019 north.\nOn the same night, the one following December 10, at 12\u2159h, Fabricius in East Frisia found Mars\u2019s position to be 3\u00b0 40\u00bc\u2019 Cancer with latitude 3\u00b0 23\u2019 N. In this observation the longitude comes out nearly the same. For the motion over 3h 40m is 3\u00bd\u2019, so that in the Brahean observation too, at 12\u2159h Mars could have been at 3\u00b0 42\u2019 Cancer\u2014two minutes beyond the Fabrician position.\nX. On 1600 January 13\/23 at 11h 40m, the time being adjusted to Uraniborg time, the planet was observed at 10\u00b0 38\u2019 46\u201c Leo ^21. The sun\u2019s position was 3\u00b0 26\u2019 30\u201c Aquarius. The stars were 7\u00b0 12\u2019 16\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion for the next few days was 1\u00b0 1\u2019 3\u201c; that of Mars, 23\u2019 44\u201c. The sum: 1\u00b0 24\u2019 47\u201c. The opposition therefore followed 5 days 2h 22m after; that is, on January 19\/29 at 2h 2m in the morning, before dawn. Mars was at 8\u00b0 38\u2019 Leo. There is no need for reduction, since it is near the limit. The latitude, from the table, was 4\u00b0 30\u2019 50\u201c N.\nXI. On the evening of 1602 Febr. 18\/28 at 10h 30m, using the Tychonic  instruments (with the help of the learned Matthias Seiffard,22 bequeathed us by Tycho), I took the distance of Mars from the middle star of the tail of Ursa Major 23 to be 52\u00b0 22\u2019. And since the distance between Cor Leonis and Procyon was 37\u00b0 22\u2019 20\u201c, which should have been 37\u00b0 19\u2019 50\u201c,24 we know that the sextant reads 2\u00bd minutes high. Therefore, the corrected distance of Mars from the tail of Ursa was 52\u00b0 19\u00bd\u2019. And since the latitude of the fixed star is 56\u00b0 22\u2019, the remainder, by subtraction, is 4\u00b0 2\u00bd\u2019\u2014supposing that Mars was at precisely the same longitude as the fixed star. But because there was a difference of 3\u00be degrees between them (as is clear from the following observations), a slight correction is required.\n For let AB be 3\u00b0 43\u2019 30\u201c on a parallel close to the ecliptic, B Mars, C the fixed star, and BC 52\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c. Dividing the secant of BC by the secant of AB gives the  secant of CA, 52\u00b0 14\u2019, which, subtracted from 56\u00b0 22\u2019 (the latitude of the fixed star) leaves 4\u00b0 8\u2019 north as Mars\u2019s observed latitude. At the same time, we found 19\u00b0 23\u2019 between Mars and Cor Leonis (19\u00b0 20\u00bd corrected), and 21\u00b0 20\u2019 between Mars and the bright star in the wing of Virgo25 (21\u00b0 17\u00bd\u2019 corrected). From these two distances (using the latitudes of the stars and Mars), Mars\u2019s longitude is found to be 13\u00b0 19\u2019 6\u201c Virgo, by consensus of all measurements.\nAlternatively, the meridian altitude of Mars was found at 12h 40m, using two quadrants, to be 50\u00b0 19\u2019, while the tail of Leo26 was 56\u00b0 45\u2019. Therefore, from the declinations and right ascensions of the fixed stars and our distances, Mars\u2019s position is determined as 13\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c Virgo, latitude 4\u00b0 7\u2019 55\u201c ^27. This is the Tychonic procedure. I have included the other for the sake of showing a consensus, and also that it might be evident that despite the lack of absolute perfection in the demonstration, short cuts either in computation or in our understanding can under certain circumstances be applied. For in that previous procedure there is less in the actual work than in the reporting of it. At Prague, 5\u00b0 Scorpio was rising ^28. Therefore, the nonagesimal was about 32\u00bd\u00b0 from the zenith. And since Mars\u2019s distance from the earth was rather more than half the sun\u2019s distance, the resulting parallax of about 5\u2019 opposite 32\u00bd\u00b0 in our parallactic table, shows a latitudinal parallax of 2\u2019 41\u201c. Thus the latitude as seen from the middle of the earth would be 4\u00b0 10\u2154\u2019 north. And because the altitude of the nonagesimal was 57\u00bd\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax at the horizon was 4\u2019 13\u201c. But since Mars was 38\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, the longitudinal parallax corresponding to this position is 2\u2019 36\u201c, and if this be eliminated, Mars would be placed at about 13\u00b0 18\u2019 Virgo ^29. At that moment, the sun\u2019s position was 10\u00b0 16\u2019 42\u201c Pisces. The distance between the bodies was 3\u00b0 1\u2019 18\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 4\u201c, and that of Mars, 24\u2019 5\u201c (for it was 24\u2019 18\u201c at 21\u00b0 Leo in 1585, and 24\u2019 at 26 Virgo in 1587). The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 24\u2019 9\u201c. The true opposition therefore followed 2 days 3 hours 43 minutes later, on 21 February\/3 March before dawn at 2h 13m, Mars being at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 35\u201c Virgo. Forty seconds must be subtracted to reduce the position to the orbit, putting Mars at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 Virgo, with slightly less latitude than before, since the latitude was then decreasing. It was therefore about 4\u00b0 10\u2019, or 4\u00b0 7\u2153\u2019 if the parallax be neglected.\n But because, since Tycho\u2019s death, we have not made frequent observations nor continued them over several days, it would be best, for certainty\u2019s sake, also to make use of those observations which David Fabricius of East Frisia, a sedulous practitioner of astronomy, has communicated to me.\nOn February 16, old style, at 5h in the morning, he took the planet\u2019s distances from the tail of Leo (for the latitude), from the neck of Leo,30 and, on the other hand, from the bright star in the southern wing of Virgo, so as to check its longitude by working it out twice.\nI could make use of Tycho\u2019s line of reasoning, which he routinely adopted in volume I of the Progymnasmata when (as here) the declination of the planet was not known. But because that method extends to ten operations, I prefer for the sake of brevity to proceed as I did before with my own observations. Here there are no hidden dangers.\nFirst, the star in the wing of Virgo, adjusted to our time, is at 4\u00b0 36\u2019 30\u201c Libra with latitude 2\u00b0 50\u2019 north. Fabricius found that Mars is 20\u00b0 18\u2019 westward from it on the zodiac, which puts Mars at about 14\u00b0 18\u2019 30\u201c Virgo. This is a preliminary, approximate figure: the longitude will shortly be corrected. Now the tail of Leo31 is at 16\u00b0 4\u2019 Virgo, with latitude 12\u00b0 18\u2019 North, and Mars was found to be 8\u00b0 17\u2019 distant from the Tail. What is sought is the distance of its parallel from the Tail, since the difference in longitude is 1\u00b0 45\u2019. Dividing the secant of 8\u00b0 17\u2019 by the secant of 1\u00b0 45\u2019 gives the secant of 8\u00b0 6\u2019, the arc sought. This subtracted from the fixed star\u2019s northern latitude of 12\u00b0 18\u2019 leaves Mars\u2019s latitude, 4\u00b0 12\u2019 north. This I now take as determined, and compare it with the latitudes of the fixed stars according to the laws of trigonometry. From the Wing of Virgo, I find Mars\u2019s longitude to be 14\u00b0 19\u2019 Virgo; from the Neck of Leo, 14\u00b0 23\u2019 36\u201c. The mean of these two is 14\u00b0 21\u2019 18\u201c Virgo. And since the sextant gave distances larger than the truth, the latitude would come out at 4\u00b0 14\u2019 north.\nOn the night following February 23, at 12h, he observed Mars in relation to five fixed stars: the Tail of Leo and Arcturus for latitude, and for the longitude, in the first instance, Spica (which followed it), and, in the second, the Neck of Leo and Cor Leonis (which preceded it).\nBy a rough estimate, I foresee that Mars is going to fall at 11\u00bc\u00b0 Virgo. It was found to be 9\u00b0 24\u2019 from the Tail of Leo, and hence, its latitude comes out at 4\u00b0 6\u2019 ^32. And now, through this and the latitudes of the fixed stars, together with their distances (17\u00b0 26\u2019 from Regulus, 17\u00b0 51\u2019 from the Neck of Leo, 37\u00b0 28\u2019 from Spica, 44\u00b0 15\u2019 from Arcturus), Mars\u2019s position comes out at 11\u00b0 21\u2019 23\u201c Virgo (from Regulus), 11\u00b0 20\u2019 52\u201c Virgo (from the Neck of Leo), and 11\u00b0 17\u2019 40\u201c (from Spica). Again (as you see) the distances err in being too great. For from the Heart and the Neck [of Leo], Mars is pushed a little eastward, and from Spica and Arcturus a little westward, and more from Arcturus, owing to its greater northern latitude ^33. The mean (ignoring Arcturus), 11\u00b0 19\u2019 20\u201c Virgo, is very nearly true. Also, the latitude is greater, namely, 4\u00b0 7\u2019 40\u201c north. Now from February 15 at 17h to 23 February at 12h, a period of 7 days 19 hours, Mars moved 3\u00b0 0\u2019: 180 minutes in 187 hours. That is, about one minute per hour. And if you wish to take it into account, the parallax (if any) is subtracted from the longitude on February 16 and a little is added on February 23.\n Because the last observation follows the time of observation found by me by 2 days 21 hours 47 min., add the motion corresponding to this time, 1\u00b0 7\u2019: the position will come out 12\u00b0 26\u2019 Virgo. The agreement is thus very good\u2014it could not be better\u2014given that both of us [that is, Kepler and Fabricius] work independently and do not rely on the facilities used by Tycho Brahe.","1697":"VIII. On 1595 October 30 at 8h 20m, the planet was found at 17\u00b0 47\u2019 15\u201c Taurus,19 not far from the nonagesimal. We may thus be sure of the parallax, although we must take it into account. The latitude was 0\u00b0 5\u2019 10\u201c north. The sun\u2019s position was 16\u00b0 50\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio. The distance between the stars was 56\u2019 45\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 35\u201c; that of Mars, 22\u2019 54\u201c, as appears by comparing the nearby observations. The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 23\u2019 29\u201c. If the distance between the stars be divided by this, it comes out to 40\u2019 47\u201c of a day, or 16 hours 19 min. Therefore, the true opposition was 0h 39m PM on October 31. Mars\u2019s position was 17\u00b0 31\u2019 40\u201c Taurus. This needs no reduction to the orbit, as it is nearly at the node. The latitude was about 0\u00b0 8\u2019 north. But comparison with the preceding and following days shows a latitude of about 5\u2019 north.\nIX. Let, at any rate, Mars\u2019s position on 1597 December 10 at 8h 30m be 3\u00b0 45\u00bd\u2019 Cancer (as above) ^20. The sun\u2019s position was 29\u00b0 4\u2019 53\u201c Sagittarius. The distance between the stars was 4\u00b0 40\u2019 37\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 61\u2019 20\u201c, that of Mars 23\u2019 40\u201c (for in 1580 the diurnal motion in Gemini was 23\u2019, and in 1582, at 17\u00b0 Cancer, it was 24\u2019). Therefore, the sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 25\u2019 0\u201c. These data show that the time of true opposition followed 3 days 7 hours 14 min. later, on December 14 at 3h 44m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 2\u00b0 27\u2153\u2019 Cancer. The reduction to the orbit (quite ridiculous here, since the observation itself has an uncertainty of several minutes) requires the addition of about 52\u201c. Therefore, the corrected position was 2\u00b0 28\u2019 Cancer. The latitude, from the table, was 3\u00b0 33\u2019 north.\nOn the same night, the one following December 10, at 12\u2159h, Fabricius in East Frisia found Mars\u2019s position to be 3\u00b0 40\u00bc\u2019 Cancer with latitude 3\u00b0 23\u2019 N. In this observation the longitude comes out nearly the same. For the motion over 3h 40m is 3\u00bd\u2019, so that in the Brahean observation too, at 12\u2159h Mars could have been at 3\u00b0 42\u2019 Cancer\u2014two minutes beyond the Fabrician position.\nX. On 1600 January 13\/23 at 11h 40m, the time being adjusted to Uraniborg time, the planet was observed at 10\u00b0 38\u2019 46\u201c Leo ^21. The sun\u2019s position was 3\u00b0 26\u2019 30\u201c Aquarius. The stars were 7\u00b0 12\u2019 16\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion for the next few days was 1\u00b0 1\u2019 3\u201c; that of Mars, 23\u2019 44\u201c. The sum: 1\u00b0 24\u2019 47\u201c. The opposition therefore followed 5 days 2h 22m after; that is, on January 19\/29 at 2h 2m in the morning, before dawn. Mars was at 8\u00b0 38\u2019 Leo. There is no need for reduction, since it is near the limit. The latitude, from the table, was 4\u00b0 30\u2019 50\u201c N.\nXI. On the evening of 1602 Febr. 18\/28 at 10h 30m, using the Tychonic  instruments (with the help of the learned Matthias Seiffard,22 bequeathed us by Tycho), I took the distance of Mars from the middle star of the tail of Ursa Major 23 to be 52\u00b0 22\u2019. And since the distance between Cor Leonis and Procyon was 37\u00b0 22\u2019 20\u201c, which should have been 37\u00b0 19\u2019 50\u201c,24 we know that the sextant reads 2\u00bd minutes high. Therefore, the corrected distance of Mars from the tail of Ursa was 52\u00b0 19\u00bd\u2019. And since the latitude of the fixed star is 56\u00b0 22\u2019, the remainder, by subtraction, is 4\u00b0 2\u00bd\u2019\u2014supposing that Mars was at precisely the same longitude as the fixed star. But because there was a difference of 3\u00be degrees between them (as is clear from the following observations), a slight correction is required.\n For let AB be 3\u00b0 43\u2019 30\u201c on a parallel close to the ecliptic, B Mars, C the fixed star, and BC 52\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c. Dividing the secant of BC by the secant of AB gives the  secant of CA, 52\u00b0 14\u2019, which, subtracted from 56\u00b0 22\u2019 (the latitude of the fixed star) leaves 4\u00b0 8\u2019 north as Mars\u2019s observed latitude. At the same time, we found 19\u00b0 23\u2019 between Mars and Cor Leonis (19\u00b0 20\u00bd corrected), and 21\u00b0 20\u2019 between Mars and the bright star in the wing of Virgo25 (21\u00b0 17\u00bd\u2019 corrected). From these two distances (using the latitudes of the stars and Mars), Mars\u2019s longitude is found to be 13\u00b0 19\u2019 6\u201c Virgo, by consensus of all measurements.\nAlternatively, the meridian altitude of Mars was found at 12h 40m, using two quadrants, to be 50\u00b0 19\u2019, while the tail of Leo26 was 56\u00b0 45\u2019. Therefore, from the declinations and right ascensions of the fixed stars and our distances, Mars\u2019s position is determined as 13\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c Virgo, latitude 4\u00b0 7\u2019 55\u201c ^27. This is the Tychonic procedure. I have included the other for the sake of showing a consensus, and also that it might be evident that despite the lack of absolute perfection in the demonstration, short cuts either in computation or in our understanding can under certain circumstances be applied. For in that previous procedure there is less in the actual work than in the reporting of it. At Prague, 5\u00b0 Scorpio was rising ^28. Therefore, the nonagesimal was about 32\u00bd\u00b0 from the zenith. And since Mars\u2019s distance from the earth was rather more than half the sun\u2019s distance, the resulting parallax of about 5\u2019 opposite 32\u00bd\u00b0 in our parallactic table, shows a latitudinal parallax of 2\u2019 41\u201c. Thus the latitude as seen from the middle of the earth would be 4\u00b0 10\u2154\u2019 north. And because the altitude of the nonagesimal was 57\u00bd\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax at the horizon was 4\u2019 13\u201c. But since Mars was 38\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, the longitudinal parallax corresponding to this position is 2\u2019 36\u201c, and if this be eliminated, Mars would be placed at about 13\u00b0 18\u2019 Virgo ^29. At that moment, the sun\u2019s position was 10\u00b0 16\u2019 42\u201c Pisces. The distance between the bodies was 3\u00b0 1\u2019 18\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 4\u201c, and that of Mars, 24\u2019 5\u201c (for it was 24\u2019 18\u201c at 21\u00b0 Leo in 1585, and 24\u2019 at 26 Virgo in 1587). The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 24\u2019 9\u201c. The true opposition therefore followed 2 days 3 hours 43 minutes later, on 21 February\/3 March before dawn at 2h 13m, Mars being at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 35\u201c Virgo. Forty seconds must be subtracted to reduce the position to the orbit, putting Mars at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 Virgo, with slightly less latitude than before, since the latitude was then decreasing. It was therefore about 4\u00b0 10\u2019, or 4\u00b0 7\u2153\u2019 if the parallax be neglected.\n But because, since Tycho\u2019s death, we have not made frequent observations nor continued them over several days, it would be best, for certainty\u2019s sake, also to make use of those observations which David Fabricius of East Frisia, a sedulous practitioner of astronomy, has communicated to me.\nOn February 16, old style, at 5h in the morning, he took the planet\u2019s distances from the tail of Leo (for the latitude), from the neck of Leo,30 and, on the other hand, from the bright star in the southern wing of Virgo, so as to check its longitude by working it out twice.\nI could make use of Tycho\u2019s line of reasoning, which he routinely adopted in volume I of the Progymnasmata when (as here) the declination of the planet was not known. But because that method extends to ten operations, I prefer for the sake of brevity to proceed as I did before with my own observations. Here there are no hidden dangers.\nFirst, the star in the wing of Virgo, adjusted to our time, is at 4\u00b0 36\u2019 30\u201c Libra with latitude 2\u00b0 50\u2019 north. Fabricius found that Mars is 20\u00b0 18\u2019 westward from it on the zodiac, which puts Mars at about 14\u00b0 18\u2019 30\u201c Virgo. This is a preliminary, approximate figure: the longitude will shortly be corrected. Now the tail of Leo31 is at 16\u00b0 4\u2019 Virgo, with latitude 12\u00b0 18\u2019 North, and Mars was found to be 8\u00b0 17\u2019 distant from the Tail. What is sought is the distance of its parallel from the Tail, since the difference in longitude is 1\u00b0 45\u2019. Dividing the secant of 8\u00b0 17\u2019 by the secant of 1\u00b0 45\u2019 gives the secant of 8\u00b0 6\u2019, the arc sought. This subtracted from the fixed star\u2019s northern latitude of 12\u00b0 18\u2019 leaves Mars\u2019s latitude, 4\u00b0 12\u2019 north. This I now take as determined, and compare it with the latitudes of the fixed stars according to the laws of trigonometry. From the Wing of Virgo, I find Mars\u2019s longitude to be 14\u00b0 19\u2019 Virgo; from the Neck of Leo, 14\u00b0 23\u2019 36\u201c. The mean of these two is 14\u00b0 21\u2019 18\u201c Virgo. And since the sextant gave distances larger than the truth, the latitude would come out at 4\u00b0 14\u2019 north.\nOn the night following February 23, at 12h, he observed Mars in relation to five fixed stars: the Tail of Leo and Arcturus for latitude, and for the longitude, in the first instance, Spica (which followed it), and, in the second, the Neck of Leo and Cor Leonis (which preceded it).\nBy a rough estimate, I foresee that Mars is going to fall at 11\u00bc\u00b0 Virgo. It was found to be 9\u00b0 24\u2019 from the Tail of Leo, and hence, its latitude comes out at 4\u00b0 6\u2019 ^32. And now, through this and the latitudes of the fixed stars, together with their distances (17\u00b0 26\u2019 from Regulus, 17\u00b0 51\u2019 from the Neck of Leo, 37\u00b0 28\u2019 from Spica, 44\u00b0 15\u2019 from Arcturus), Mars\u2019s position comes out at 11\u00b0 21\u2019 23\u201c Virgo (from Regulus), 11\u00b0 20\u2019 52\u201c Virgo (from the Neck of Leo), and 11\u00b0 17\u2019 40\u201c (from Spica). Again (as you see) the distances err in being too great. For from the Heart and the Neck [of Leo], Mars is pushed a little eastward, and from Spica and Arcturus a little westward, and more from Arcturus, owing to its greater northern latitude ^33. The mean (ignoring Arcturus), 11\u00b0 19\u2019 20\u201c Virgo, is very nearly true. Also, the latitude is greater, namely, 4\u00b0 7\u2019 40\u201c north. Now from February 15 at 17h to 23 February at 12h, a period of 7 days 19 hours, Mars moved 3\u00b0 0\u2019: 180 minutes in 187 hours. That is, about one minute per hour. And if you wish to take it into account, the parallax (if any) is subtracted from the longitude on February 16 and a little is added on February 23.\n Because the last observation follows the time of observation found by me by 2 days 21 hours 47 min., add the motion corresponding to this time, 1\u00b0 7\u2019: the position will come out 12\u00b0 26\u2019 Virgo. The agreement is thus very good\u2014it could not be better\u2014given that both of us [that is, Kepler and Fabricius] work independently and do not rely on the facilities used by Tycho Brahe.","1698":"VIII. On 1595 October 30 at 8h 20m, the planet was found at 17\u00b0 47\u2019 15\u201c Taurus,19 not far from the nonagesimal. We may thus be sure of the parallax, although we must take it into account. The latitude was 0\u00b0 5\u2019 10\u201c north. The sun\u2019s position was 16\u00b0 50\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio. The distance between the stars was 56\u2019 45\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 35\u201c; that of Mars, 22\u2019 54\u201c, as appears by comparing the nearby observations. The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 23\u2019 29\u201c. If the distance between the stars be divided by this, it comes out to 40\u2019 47\u201c of a day, or 16 hours 19 min. Therefore, the true opposition was 0h 39m PM on October 31. Mars\u2019s position was 17\u00b0 31\u2019 40\u201c Taurus. This needs no reduction to the orbit, as it is nearly at the node. The latitude was about 0\u00b0 8\u2019 north. But comparison with the preceding and following days shows a latitude of about 5\u2019 north.\nIX. Let, at any rate, Mars\u2019s position on 1597 December 10 at 8h 30m be 3\u00b0 45\u00bd\u2019 Cancer (as above) ^20. The sun\u2019s position was 29\u00b0 4\u2019 53\u201c Sagittarius. The distance between the stars was 4\u00b0 40\u2019 37\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 61\u2019 20\u201c, that of Mars 23\u2019 40\u201c (for in 1580 the diurnal motion in Gemini was 23\u2019, and in 1582, at 17\u00b0 Cancer, it was 24\u2019). Therefore, the sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 25\u2019 0\u201c. These data show that the time of true opposition followed 3 days 7 hours 14 min. later, on December 14 at 3h 44m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 2\u00b0 27\u2153\u2019 Cancer. The reduction to the orbit (quite ridiculous here, since the observation itself has an uncertainty of several minutes) requires the addition of about 52\u201c. Therefore, the corrected position was 2\u00b0 28\u2019 Cancer. The latitude, from the table, was 3\u00b0 33\u2019 north.\nOn the same night, the one following December 10, at 12\u2159h, Fabricius in East Frisia found Mars\u2019s position to be 3\u00b0 40\u00bc\u2019 Cancer with latitude 3\u00b0 23\u2019 N. In this observation the longitude comes out nearly the same. For the motion over 3h 40m is 3\u00bd\u2019, so that in the Brahean observation too, at 12\u2159h Mars could have been at 3\u00b0 42\u2019 Cancer\u2014two minutes beyond the Fabrician position.\nX. On 1600 January 13\/23 at 11h 40m, the time being adjusted to Uraniborg time, the planet was observed at 10\u00b0 38\u2019 46\u201c Leo ^21. The sun\u2019s position was 3\u00b0 26\u2019 30\u201c Aquarius. The stars were 7\u00b0 12\u2019 16\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion for the next few days was 1\u00b0 1\u2019 3\u201c; that of Mars, 23\u2019 44\u201c. The sum: 1\u00b0 24\u2019 47\u201c. The opposition therefore followed 5 days 2h 22m after; that is, on January 19\/29 at 2h 2m in the morning, before dawn. Mars was at 8\u00b0 38\u2019 Leo. There is no need for reduction, since it is near the limit. The latitude, from the table, was 4\u00b0 30\u2019 50\u201c N.\nXI. On the evening of 1602 Febr. 18\/28 at 10h 30m, using the Tychonic  instruments (with the help of the learned Matthias Seiffard,22 bequeathed us by Tycho), I took the distance of Mars from the middle star of the tail of Ursa Major 23 to be 52\u00b0 22\u2019. And since the distance between Cor Leonis and Procyon was 37\u00b0 22\u2019 20\u201c, which should have been 37\u00b0 19\u2019 50\u201c,24 we know that the sextant reads 2\u00bd minutes high. Therefore, the corrected distance of Mars from the tail of Ursa was 52\u00b0 19\u00bd\u2019. And since the latitude of the fixed star is 56\u00b0 22\u2019, the remainder, by subtraction, is 4\u00b0 2\u00bd\u2019\u2014supposing that Mars was at precisely the same longitude as the fixed star. But because there was a difference of 3\u00be degrees between them (as is clear from the following observations), a slight correction is required.\n For let AB be 3\u00b0 43\u2019 30\u201c on a parallel close to the ecliptic, B Mars, C the fixed star, and BC 52\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c. Dividing the secant of BC by the secant of AB gives the  secant of CA, 52\u00b0 14\u2019, which, subtracted from 56\u00b0 22\u2019 (the latitude of the fixed star) leaves 4\u00b0 8\u2019 north as Mars\u2019s observed latitude. At the same time, we found 19\u00b0 23\u2019 between Mars and Cor Leonis (19\u00b0 20\u00bd corrected), and 21\u00b0 20\u2019 between Mars and the bright star in the wing of Virgo25 (21\u00b0 17\u00bd\u2019 corrected). From these two distances (using the latitudes of the stars and Mars), Mars\u2019s longitude is found to be 13\u00b0 19\u2019 6\u201c Virgo, by consensus of all measurements.\nAlternatively, the meridian altitude of Mars was found at 12h 40m, using two quadrants, to be 50\u00b0 19\u2019, while the tail of Leo26 was 56\u00b0 45\u2019. Therefore, from the declinations and right ascensions of the fixed stars and our distances, Mars\u2019s position is determined as 13\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c Virgo, latitude 4\u00b0 7\u2019 55\u201c ^27. This is the Tychonic procedure. I have included the other for the sake of showing a consensus, and also that it might be evident that despite the lack of absolute perfection in the demonstration, short cuts either in computation or in our understanding can under certain circumstances be applied. For in that previous procedure there is less in the actual work than in the reporting of it. At Prague, 5\u00b0 Scorpio was rising ^28. Therefore, the nonagesimal was about 32\u00bd\u00b0 from the zenith. And since Mars\u2019s distance from the earth was rather more than half the sun\u2019s distance, the resulting parallax of about 5\u2019 opposite 32\u00bd\u00b0 in our parallactic table, shows a latitudinal parallax of 2\u2019 41\u201c. Thus the latitude as seen from the middle of the earth would be 4\u00b0 10\u2154\u2019 north. And because the altitude of the nonagesimal was 57\u00bd\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax at the horizon was 4\u2019 13\u201c. But since Mars was 38\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, the longitudinal parallax corresponding to this position is 2\u2019 36\u201c, and if this be eliminated, Mars would be placed at about 13\u00b0 18\u2019 Virgo ^29. At that moment, the sun\u2019s position was 10\u00b0 16\u2019 42\u201c Pisces. The distance between the bodies was 3\u00b0 1\u2019 18\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 4\u201c, and that of Mars, 24\u2019 5\u201c (for it was 24\u2019 18\u201c at 21\u00b0 Leo in 1585, and 24\u2019 at 26 Virgo in 1587). The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 24\u2019 9\u201c. The true opposition therefore followed 2 days 3 hours 43 minutes later, on 21 February\/3 March before dawn at 2h 13m, Mars being at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 35\u201c Virgo. Forty seconds must be subtracted to reduce the position to the orbit, putting Mars at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 Virgo, with slightly less latitude than before, since the latitude was then decreasing. It was therefore about 4\u00b0 10\u2019, or 4\u00b0 7\u2153\u2019 if the parallax be neglected.\n But because, since Tycho\u2019s death, we have not made frequent observations nor continued them over several days, it would be best, for certainty\u2019s sake, also to make use of those observations which David Fabricius of East Frisia, a sedulous practitioner of astronomy, has communicated to me.\nOn February 16, old style, at 5h in the morning, he took the planet\u2019s distances from the tail of Leo (for the latitude), from the neck of Leo,30 and, on the other hand, from the bright star in the southern wing of Virgo, so as to check its longitude by working it out twice.\nI could make use of Tycho\u2019s line of reasoning, which he routinely adopted in volume I of the Progymnasmata when (as here) the declination of the planet was not known. But because that method extends to ten operations, I prefer for the sake of brevity to proceed as I did before with my own observations. Here there are no hidden dangers.\nFirst, the star in the wing of Virgo, adjusted to our time, is at 4\u00b0 36\u2019 30\u201c Libra with latitude 2\u00b0 50\u2019 north. Fabricius found that Mars is 20\u00b0 18\u2019 westward from it on the zodiac, which puts Mars at about 14\u00b0 18\u2019 30\u201c Virgo. This is a preliminary, approximate figure: the longitude will shortly be corrected. Now the tail of Leo31 is at 16\u00b0 4\u2019 Virgo, with latitude 12\u00b0 18\u2019 North, and Mars was found to be 8\u00b0 17\u2019 distant from the Tail. What is sought is the distance of its parallel from the Tail, since the difference in longitude is 1\u00b0 45\u2019. Dividing the secant of 8\u00b0 17\u2019 by the secant of 1\u00b0 45\u2019 gives the secant of 8\u00b0 6\u2019, the arc sought. This subtracted from the fixed star\u2019s northern latitude of 12\u00b0 18\u2019 leaves Mars\u2019s latitude, 4\u00b0 12\u2019 north. This I now take as determined, and compare it with the latitudes of the fixed stars according to the laws of trigonometry. From the Wing of Virgo, I find Mars\u2019s longitude to be 14\u00b0 19\u2019 Virgo; from the Neck of Leo, 14\u00b0 23\u2019 36\u201c. The mean of these two is 14\u00b0 21\u2019 18\u201c Virgo. And since the sextant gave distances larger than the truth, the latitude would come out at 4\u00b0 14\u2019 north.\nOn the night following February 23, at 12h, he observed Mars in relation to five fixed stars: the Tail of Leo and Arcturus for latitude, and for the longitude, in the first instance, Spica (which followed it), and, in the second, the Neck of Leo and Cor Leonis (which preceded it).\nBy a rough estimate, I foresee that Mars is going to fall at 11\u00bc\u00b0 Virgo. It was found to be 9\u00b0 24\u2019 from the Tail of Leo, and hence, its latitude comes out at 4\u00b0 6\u2019 ^32. And now, through this and the latitudes of the fixed stars, together with their distances (17\u00b0 26\u2019 from Regulus, 17\u00b0 51\u2019 from the Neck of Leo, 37\u00b0 28\u2019 from Spica, 44\u00b0 15\u2019 from Arcturus), Mars\u2019s position comes out at 11\u00b0 21\u2019 23\u201c Virgo (from Regulus), 11\u00b0 20\u2019 52\u201c Virgo (from the Neck of Leo), and 11\u00b0 17\u2019 40\u201c (from Spica). Again (as you see) the distances err in being too great. For from the Heart and the Neck [of Leo], Mars is pushed a little eastward, and from Spica and Arcturus a little westward, and more from Arcturus, owing to its greater northern latitude ^33. The mean (ignoring Arcturus), 11\u00b0 19\u2019 20\u201c Virgo, is very nearly true. Also, the latitude is greater, namely, 4\u00b0 7\u2019 40\u201c north. Now from February 15 at 17h to 23 February at 12h, a period of 7 days 19 hours, Mars moved 3\u00b0 0\u2019: 180 minutes in 187 hours. That is, about one minute per hour. And if you wish to take it into account, the parallax (if any) is subtracted from the longitude on February 16 and a little is added on February 23.\n Because the last observation follows the time of observation found by me by 2 days 21 hours 47 min., add the motion corresponding to this time, 1\u00b0 7\u2019: the position will come out 12\u00b0 26\u2019 Virgo. The agreement is thus very good\u2014it could not be better\u2014given that both of us [that is, Kepler and Fabricius] work independently and do not rely on the facilities used by Tycho Brahe.","1699":"VIII. On 1595 October 30 at 8h 20m, the planet was found at 17\u00b0 47\u2019 15\u201c Taurus,19 not far from the nonagesimal. We may thus be sure of the parallax, although we must take it into account. The latitude was 0\u00b0 5\u2019 10\u201c north. The sun\u2019s position was 16\u00b0 50\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio. The distance between the stars was 56\u2019 45\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 35\u201c; that of Mars, 22\u2019 54\u201c, as appears by comparing the nearby observations. The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 23\u2019 29\u201c. If the distance between the stars be divided by this, it comes out to 40\u2019 47\u201c of a day, or 16 hours 19 min. Therefore, the true opposition was 0h 39m PM on October 31. Mars\u2019s position was 17\u00b0 31\u2019 40\u201c Taurus. This needs no reduction to the orbit, as it is nearly at the node. The latitude was about 0\u00b0 8\u2019 north. But comparison with the preceding and following days shows a latitude of about 5\u2019 north.\nIX. Let, at any rate, Mars\u2019s position on 1597 December 10 at 8h 30m be 3\u00b0 45\u00bd\u2019 Cancer (as above) ^20. The sun\u2019s position was 29\u00b0 4\u2019 53\u201c Sagittarius. The distance between the stars was 4\u00b0 40\u2019 37\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 61\u2019 20\u201c, that of Mars 23\u2019 40\u201c (for in 1580 the diurnal motion in Gemini was 23\u2019, and in 1582, at 17\u00b0 Cancer, it was 24\u2019). Therefore, the sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 25\u2019 0\u201c. These data show that the time of true opposition followed 3 days 7 hours 14 min. later, on December 14 at 3h 44m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 2\u00b0 27\u2153\u2019 Cancer. The reduction to the orbit (quite ridiculous here, since the observation itself has an uncertainty of several minutes) requires the addition of about 52\u201c. Therefore, the corrected position was 2\u00b0 28\u2019 Cancer. The latitude, from the table, was 3\u00b0 33\u2019 north.\nOn the same night, the one following December 10, at 12\u2159h, Fabricius in East Frisia found Mars\u2019s position to be 3\u00b0 40\u00bc\u2019 Cancer with latitude 3\u00b0 23\u2019 N. In this observation the longitude comes out nearly the same. For the motion over 3h 40m is 3\u00bd\u2019, so that in the Brahean observation too, at 12\u2159h Mars could have been at 3\u00b0 42\u2019 Cancer\u2014two minutes beyond the Fabrician position.\nX. On 1600 January 13\/23 at 11h 40m, the time being adjusted to Uraniborg time, the planet was observed at 10\u00b0 38\u2019 46\u201c Leo ^21. The sun\u2019s position was 3\u00b0 26\u2019 30\u201c Aquarius. The stars were 7\u00b0 12\u2019 16\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion for the next few days was 1\u00b0 1\u2019 3\u201c; that of Mars, 23\u2019 44\u201c. The sum: 1\u00b0 24\u2019 47\u201c. The opposition therefore followed 5 days 2h 22m after; that is, on January 19\/29 at 2h 2m in the morning, before dawn. Mars was at 8\u00b0 38\u2019 Leo. There is no need for reduction, since it is near the limit. The latitude, from the table, was 4\u00b0 30\u2019 50\u201c N.\nXI. On the evening of 1602 Febr. 18\/28 at 10h 30m, using the Tychonic  instruments (with the help of the learned Matthias Seiffard,22 bequeathed us by Tycho), I took the distance of Mars from the middle star of the tail of Ursa Major 23 to be 52\u00b0 22\u2019. And since the distance between Cor Leonis and Procyon was 37\u00b0 22\u2019 20\u201c, which should have been 37\u00b0 19\u2019 50\u201c,24 we know that the sextant reads 2\u00bd minutes high. Therefore, the corrected distance of Mars from the tail of Ursa was 52\u00b0 19\u00bd\u2019. And since the latitude of the fixed star is 56\u00b0 22\u2019, the remainder, by subtraction, is 4\u00b0 2\u00bd\u2019\u2014supposing that Mars was at precisely the same longitude as the fixed star. But because there was a difference of 3\u00be degrees between them (as is clear from the following observations), a slight correction is required.\n For let AB be 3\u00b0 43\u2019 30\u201c on a parallel close to the ecliptic, B Mars, C the fixed star, and BC 52\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c. Dividing the secant of BC by the secant of AB gives the  secant of CA, 52\u00b0 14\u2019, which, subtracted from 56\u00b0 22\u2019 (the latitude of the fixed star) leaves 4\u00b0 8\u2019 north as Mars\u2019s observed latitude. At the same time, we found 19\u00b0 23\u2019 between Mars and Cor Leonis (19\u00b0 20\u00bd corrected), and 21\u00b0 20\u2019 between Mars and the bright star in the wing of Virgo25 (21\u00b0 17\u00bd\u2019 corrected). From these two distances (using the latitudes of the stars and Mars), Mars\u2019s longitude is found to be 13\u00b0 19\u2019 6\u201c Virgo, by consensus of all measurements.\nAlternatively, the meridian altitude of Mars was found at 12h 40m, using two quadrants, to be 50\u00b0 19\u2019, while the tail of Leo26 was 56\u00b0 45\u2019. Therefore, from the declinations and right ascensions of the fixed stars and our distances, Mars\u2019s position is determined as 13\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c Virgo, latitude 4\u00b0 7\u2019 55\u201c ^27. This is the Tychonic procedure. I have included the other for the sake of showing a consensus, and also that it might be evident that despite the lack of absolute perfection in the demonstration, short cuts either in computation or in our understanding can under certain circumstances be applied. For in that previous procedure there is less in the actual work than in the reporting of it. At Prague, 5\u00b0 Scorpio was rising ^28. Therefore, the nonagesimal was about 32\u00bd\u00b0 from the zenith. And since Mars\u2019s distance from the earth was rather more than half the sun\u2019s distance, the resulting parallax of about 5\u2019 opposite 32\u00bd\u00b0 in our parallactic table, shows a latitudinal parallax of 2\u2019 41\u201c. Thus the latitude as seen from the middle of the earth would be 4\u00b0 10\u2154\u2019 north. And because the altitude of the nonagesimal was 57\u00bd\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax at the horizon was 4\u2019 13\u201c. But since Mars was 38\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, the longitudinal parallax corresponding to this position is 2\u2019 36\u201c, and if this be eliminated, Mars would be placed at about 13\u00b0 18\u2019 Virgo ^29. At that moment, the sun\u2019s position was 10\u00b0 16\u2019 42\u201c Pisces. The distance between the bodies was 3\u00b0 1\u2019 18\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 4\u201c, and that of Mars, 24\u2019 5\u201c (for it was 24\u2019 18\u201c at 21\u00b0 Leo in 1585, and 24\u2019 at 26 Virgo in 1587). The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 24\u2019 9\u201c. The true opposition therefore followed 2 days 3 hours 43 minutes later, on 21 February\/3 March before dawn at 2h 13m, Mars being at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 35\u201c Virgo. Forty seconds must be subtracted to reduce the position to the orbit, putting Mars at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 Virgo, with slightly less latitude than before, since the latitude was then decreasing. It was therefore about 4\u00b0 10\u2019, or 4\u00b0 7\u2153\u2019 if the parallax be neglected.\n But because, since Tycho\u2019s death, we have not made frequent observations nor continued them over several days, it would be best, for certainty\u2019s sake, also to make use of those observations which David Fabricius of East Frisia, a sedulous practitioner of astronomy, has communicated to me.\nOn February 16, old style, at 5h in the morning, he took the planet\u2019s distances from the tail of Leo (for the latitude), from the neck of Leo,30 and, on the other hand, from the bright star in the southern wing of Virgo, so as to check its longitude by working it out twice.\nI could make use of Tycho\u2019s line of reasoning, which he routinely adopted in volume I of the Progymnasmata when (as here) the declination of the planet was not known. But because that method extends to ten operations, I prefer for the sake of brevity to proceed as I did before with my own observations. Here there are no hidden dangers.\nFirst, the star in the wing of Virgo, adjusted to our time, is at 4\u00b0 36\u2019 30\u201c Libra with latitude 2\u00b0 50\u2019 north. Fabricius found that Mars is 20\u00b0 18\u2019 westward from it on the zodiac, which puts Mars at about 14\u00b0 18\u2019 30\u201c Virgo. This is a preliminary, approximate figure: the longitude will shortly be corrected. Now the tail of Leo31 is at 16\u00b0 4\u2019 Virgo, with latitude 12\u00b0 18\u2019 North, and Mars was found to be 8\u00b0 17\u2019 distant from the Tail. What is sought is the distance of its parallel from the Tail, since the difference in longitude is 1\u00b0 45\u2019. Dividing the secant of 8\u00b0 17\u2019 by the secant of 1\u00b0 45\u2019 gives the secant of 8\u00b0 6\u2019, the arc sought. This subtracted from the fixed star\u2019s northern latitude of 12\u00b0 18\u2019 leaves Mars\u2019s latitude, 4\u00b0 12\u2019 north. This I now take as determined, and compare it with the latitudes of the fixed stars according to the laws of trigonometry. From the Wing of Virgo, I find Mars\u2019s longitude to be 14\u00b0 19\u2019 Virgo; from the Neck of Leo, 14\u00b0 23\u2019 36\u201c. The mean of these two is 14\u00b0 21\u2019 18\u201c Virgo. And since the sextant gave distances larger than the truth, the latitude would come out at 4\u00b0 14\u2019 north.\nOn the night following February 23, at 12h, he observed Mars in relation to five fixed stars: the Tail of Leo and Arcturus for latitude, and for the longitude, in the first instance, Spica (which followed it), and, in the second, the Neck of Leo and Cor Leonis (which preceded it).\nBy a rough estimate, I foresee that Mars is going to fall at 11\u00bc\u00b0 Virgo. It was found to be 9\u00b0 24\u2019 from the Tail of Leo, and hence, its latitude comes out at 4\u00b0 6\u2019 ^32. And now, through this and the latitudes of the fixed stars, together with their distances (17\u00b0 26\u2019 from Regulus, 17\u00b0 51\u2019 from the Neck of Leo, 37\u00b0 28\u2019 from Spica, 44\u00b0 15\u2019 from Arcturus), Mars\u2019s position comes out at 11\u00b0 21\u2019 23\u201c Virgo (from Regulus), 11\u00b0 20\u2019 52\u201c Virgo (from the Neck of Leo), and 11\u00b0 17\u2019 40\u201c (from Spica). Again (as you see) the distances err in being too great. For from the Heart and the Neck [of Leo], Mars is pushed a little eastward, and from Spica and Arcturus a little westward, and more from Arcturus, owing to its greater northern latitude ^33. The mean (ignoring Arcturus), 11\u00b0 19\u2019 20\u201c Virgo, is very nearly true. Also, the latitude is greater, namely, 4\u00b0 7\u2019 40\u201c north. Now from February 15 at 17h to 23 February at 12h, a period of 7 days 19 hours, Mars moved 3\u00b0 0\u2019: 180 minutes in 187 hours. That is, about one minute per hour. And if you wish to take it into account, the parallax (if any) is subtracted from the longitude on February 16 and a little is added on February 23.\n Because the last observation follows the time of observation found by me by 2 days 21 hours 47 min., add the motion corresponding to this time, 1\u00b0 7\u2019: the position will come out 12\u00b0 26\u2019 Virgo. The agreement is thus very good\u2014it could not be better\u2014given that both of us [that is, Kepler and Fabricius] work independently and do not rely on the facilities used by Tycho Brahe.","1700":"VIII. On 1595 October 30 at 8h 20m, the planet was found at 17\u00b0 47\u2019 15\u201c Taurus,19 not far from the nonagesimal. We may thus be sure of the parallax, although we must take it into account. The latitude was 0\u00b0 5\u2019 10\u201c north. The sun\u2019s position was 16\u00b0 50\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio. The distance between the stars was 56\u2019 45\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 35\u201c; that of Mars, 22\u2019 54\u201c, as appears by comparing the nearby observations. The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 23\u2019 29\u201c. If the distance between the stars be divided by this, it comes out to 40\u2019 47\u201c of a day, or 16 hours 19 min. Therefore, the true opposition was 0h 39m PM on October 31. Mars\u2019s position was 17\u00b0 31\u2019 40\u201c Taurus. This needs no reduction to the orbit, as it is nearly at the node. The latitude was about 0\u00b0 8\u2019 north. But comparison with the preceding and following days shows a latitude of about 5\u2019 north.\nIX. Let, at any rate, Mars\u2019s position on 1597 December 10 at 8h 30m be 3\u00b0 45\u00bd\u2019 Cancer (as above) ^20. The sun\u2019s position was 29\u00b0 4\u2019 53\u201c Sagittarius. The distance between the stars was 4\u00b0 40\u2019 37\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 61\u2019 20\u201c, that of Mars 23\u2019 40\u201c (for in 1580 the diurnal motion in Gemini was 23\u2019, and in 1582, at 17\u00b0 Cancer, it was 24\u2019). Therefore, the sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 25\u2019 0\u201c. These data show that the time of true opposition followed 3 days 7 hours 14 min. later, on December 14 at 3h 44m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 2\u00b0 27\u2153\u2019 Cancer. The reduction to the orbit (quite ridiculous here, since the observation itself has an uncertainty of several minutes) requires the addition of about 52\u201c. Therefore, the corrected position was 2\u00b0 28\u2019 Cancer. The latitude, from the table, was 3\u00b0 33\u2019 north.\nOn the same night, the one following December 10, at 12\u2159h, Fabricius in East Frisia found Mars\u2019s position to be 3\u00b0 40\u00bc\u2019 Cancer with latitude 3\u00b0 23\u2019 N. In this observation the longitude comes out nearly the same. For the motion over 3h 40m is 3\u00bd\u2019, so that in the Brahean observation too, at 12\u2159h Mars could have been at 3\u00b0 42\u2019 Cancer\u2014two minutes beyond the Fabrician position.\nX. On 1600 January 13\/23 at 11h 40m, the time being adjusted to Uraniborg time, the planet was observed at 10\u00b0 38\u2019 46\u201c Leo ^21. The sun\u2019s position was 3\u00b0 26\u2019 30\u201c Aquarius. The stars were 7\u00b0 12\u2019 16\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion for the next few days was 1\u00b0 1\u2019 3\u201c; that of Mars, 23\u2019 44\u201c. The sum: 1\u00b0 24\u2019 47\u201c. The opposition therefore followed 5 days 2h 22m after; that is, on January 19\/29 at 2h 2m in the morning, before dawn. Mars was at 8\u00b0 38\u2019 Leo. There is no need for reduction, since it is near the limit. The latitude, from the table, was 4\u00b0 30\u2019 50\u201c N.\nXI. On the evening of 1602 Febr. 18\/28 at 10h 30m, using the Tychonic  instruments (with the help of the learned Matthias Seiffard,22 bequeathed us by Tycho), I took the distance of Mars from the middle star of the tail of Ursa Major 23 to be 52\u00b0 22\u2019. And since the distance between Cor Leonis and Procyon was 37\u00b0 22\u2019 20\u201c, which should have been 37\u00b0 19\u2019 50\u201c,24 we know that the sextant reads 2\u00bd minutes high. Therefore, the corrected distance of Mars from the tail of Ursa was 52\u00b0 19\u00bd\u2019. And since the latitude of the fixed star is 56\u00b0 22\u2019, the remainder, by subtraction, is 4\u00b0 2\u00bd\u2019\u2014supposing that Mars was at precisely the same longitude as the fixed star. But because there was a difference of 3\u00be degrees between them (as is clear from the following observations), a slight correction is required.\n For let AB be 3\u00b0 43\u2019 30\u201c on a parallel close to the ecliptic, B Mars, C the fixed star, and BC 52\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c. Dividing the secant of BC by the secant of AB gives the  secant of CA, 52\u00b0 14\u2019, which, subtracted from 56\u00b0 22\u2019 (the latitude of the fixed star) leaves 4\u00b0 8\u2019 north as Mars\u2019s observed latitude. At the same time, we found 19\u00b0 23\u2019 between Mars and Cor Leonis (19\u00b0 20\u00bd corrected), and 21\u00b0 20\u2019 between Mars and the bright star in the wing of Virgo25 (21\u00b0 17\u00bd\u2019 corrected). From these two distances (using the latitudes of the stars and Mars), Mars\u2019s longitude is found to be 13\u00b0 19\u2019 6\u201c Virgo, by consensus of all measurements.\nAlternatively, the meridian altitude of Mars was found at 12h 40m, using two quadrants, to be 50\u00b0 19\u2019, while the tail of Leo26 was 56\u00b0 45\u2019. Therefore, from the declinations and right ascensions of the fixed stars and our distances, Mars\u2019s position is determined as 13\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c Virgo, latitude 4\u00b0 7\u2019 55\u201c ^27. This is the Tychonic procedure. I have included the other for the sake of showing a consensus, and also that it might be evident that despite the lack of absolute perfection in the demonstration, short cuts either in computation or in our understanding can under certain circumstances be applied. For in that previous procedure there is less in the actual work than in the reporting of it. At Prague, 5\u00b0 Scorpio was rising ^28. Therefore, the nonagesimal was about 32\u00bd\u00b0 from the zenith. And since Mars\u2019s distance from the earth was rather more than half the sun\u2019s distance, the resulting parallax of about 5\u2019 opposite 32\u00bd\u00b0 in our parallactic table, shows a latitudinal parallax of 2\u2019 41\u201c. Thus the latitude as seen from the middle of the earth would be 4\u00b0 10\u2154\u2019 north. And because the altitude of the nonagesimal was 57\u00bd\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax at the horizon was 4\u2019 13\u201c. But since Mars was 38\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, the longitudinal parallax corresponding to this position is 2\u2019 36\u201c, and if this be eliminated, Mars would be placed at about 13\u00b0 18\u2019 Virgo ^29. At that moment, the sun\u2019s position was 10\u00b0 16\u2019 42\u201c Pisces. The distance between the bodies was 3\u00b0 1\u2019 18\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 4\u201c, and that of Mars, 24\u2019 5\u201c (for it was 24\u2019 18\u201c at 21\u00b0 Leo in 1585, and 24\u2019 at 26 Virgo in 1587). The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 24\u2019 9\u201c. The true opposition therefore followed 2 days 3 hours 43 minutes later, on 21 February\/3 March before dawn at 2h 13m, Mars being at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 35\u201c Virgo. Forty seconds must be subtracted to reduce the position to the orbit, putting Mars at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 Virgo, with slightly less latitude than before, since the latitude was then decreasing. It was therefore about 4\u00b0 10\u2019, or 4\u00b0 7\u2153\u2019 if the parallax be neglected.\n But because, since Tycho\u2019s death, we have not made frequent observations nor continued them over several days, it would be best, for certainty\u2019s sake, also to make use of those observations which David Fabricius of East Frisia, a sedulous practitioner of astronomy, has communicated to me.\nOn February 16, old style, at 5h in the morning, he took the planet\u2019s distances from the tail of Leo (for the latitude), from the neck of Leo,30 and, on the other hand, from the bright star in the southern wing of Virgo, so as to check its longitude by working it out twice.\nI could make use of Tycho\u2019s line of reasoning, which he routinely adopted in volume I of the Progymnasmata when (as here) the declination of the planet was not known. But because that method extends to ten operations, I prefer for the sake of brevity to proceed as I did before with my own observations. Here there are no hidden dangers.\nFirst, the star in the wing of Virgo, adjusted to our time, is at 4\u00b0 36\u2019 30\u201c Libra with latitude 2\u00b0 50\u2019 north. Fabricius found that Mars is 20\u00b0 18\u2019 westward from it on the zodiac, which puts Mars at about 14\u00b0 18\u2019 30\u201c Virgo. This is a preliminary, approximate figure: the longitude will shortly be corrected. Now the tail of Leo31 is at 16\u00b0 4\u2019 Virgo, with latitude 12\u00b0 18\u2019 North, and Mars was found to be 8\u00b0 17\u2019 distant from the Tail. What is sought is the distance of its parallel from the Tail, since the difference in longitude is 1\u00b0 45\u2019. Dividing the secant of 8\u00b0 17\u2019 by the secant of 1\u00b0 45\u2019 gives the secant of 8\u00b0 6\u2019, the arc sought. This subtracted from the fixed star\u2019s northern latitude of 12\u00b0 18\u2019 leaves Mars\u2019s latitude, 4\u00b0 12\u2019 north. This I now take as determined, and compare it with the latitudes of the fixed stars according to the laws of trigonometry. From the Wing of Virgo, I find Mars\u2019s longitude to be 14\u00b0 19\u2019 Virgo; from the Neck of Leo, 14\u00b0 23\u2019 36\u201c. The mean of these two is 14\u00b0 21\u2019 18\u201c Virgo. And since the sextant gave distances larger than the truth, the latitude would come out at 4\u00b0 14\u2019 north.\nOn the night following February 23, at 12h, he observed Mars in relation to five fixed stars: the Tail of Leo and Arcturus for latitude, and for the longitude, in the first instance, Spica (which followed it), and, in the second, the Neck of Leo and Cor Leonis (which preceded it).\nBy a rough estimate, I foresee that Mars is going to fall at 11\u00bc\u00b0 Virgo. It was found to be 9\u00b0 24\u2019 from the Tail of Leo, and hence, its latitude comes out at 4\u00b0 6\u2019 ^32. And now, through this and the latitudes of the fixed stars, together with their distances (17\u00b0 26\u2019 from Regulus, 17\u00b0 51\u2019 from the Neck of Leo, 37\u00b0 28\u2019 from Spica, 44\u00b0 15\u2019 from Arcturus), Mars\u2019s position comes out at 11\u00b0 21\u2019 23\u201c Virgo (from Regulus), 11\u00b0 20\u2019 52\u201c Virgo (from the Neck of Leo), and 11\u00b0 17\u2019 40\u201c (from Spica). Again (as you see) the distances err in being too great. For from the Heart and the Neck [of Leo], Mars is pushed a little eastward, and from Spica and Arcturus a little westward, and more from Arcturus, owing to its greater northern latitude ^33. The mean (ignoring Arcturus), 11\u00b0 19\u2019 20\u201c Virgo, is very nearly true. Also, the latitude is greater, namely, 4\u00b0 7\u2019 40\u201c north. Now from February 15 at 17h to 23 February at 12h, a period of 7 days 19 hours, Mars moved 3\u00b0 0\u2019: 180 minutes in 187 hours. That is, about one minute per hour. And if you wish to take it into account, the parallax (if any) is subtracted from the longitude on February 16 and a little is added on February 23.\n Because the last observation follows the time of observation found by me by 2 days 21 hours 47 min., add the motion corresponding to this time, 1\u00b0 7\u2019: the position will come out 12\u00b0 26\u2019 Virgo. The agreement is thus very good\u2014it could not be better\u2014given that both of us [that is, Kepler and Fabricius] work independently and do not rely on the facilities used by Tycho Brahe.","1701":"VIII. On 1595 October 30 at 8h 20m, the planet was found at 17\u00b0 47\u2019 15\u201c Taurus,19 not far from the nonagesimal. We may thus be sure of the parallax, although we must take it into account. The latitude was 0\u00b0 5\u2019 10\u201c north. The sun\u2019s position was 16\u00b0 50\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio. The distance between the stars was 56\u2019 45\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 35\u201c; that of Mars, 22\u2019 54\u201c, as appears by comparing the nearby observations. The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 23\u2019 29\u201c. If the distance between the stars be divided by this, it comes out to 40\u2019 47\u201c of a day, or 16 hours 19 min. Therefore, the true opposition was 0h 39m PM on October 31. Mars\u2019s position was 17\u00b0 31\u2019 40\u201c Taurus. This needs no reduction to the orbit, as it is nearly at the node. The latitude was about 0\u00b0 8\u2019 north. But comparison with the preceding and following days shows a latitude of about 5\u2019 north.\nIX. Let, at any rate, Mars\u2019s position on 1597 December 10 at 8h 30m be 3\u00b0 45\u00bd\u2019 Cancer (as above) ^20. The sun\u2019s position was 29\u00b0 4\u2019 53\u201c Sagittarius. The distance between the stars was 4\u00b0 40\u2019 37\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 61\u2019 20\u201c, that of Mars 23\u2019 40\u201c (for in 1580 the diurnal motion in Gemini was 23\u2019, and in 1582, at 17\u00b0 Cancer, it was 24\u2019). Therefore, the sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 25\u2019 0\u201c. These data show that the time of true opposition followed 3 days 7 hours 14 min. later, on December 14 at 3h 44m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 2\u00b0 27\u2153\u2019 Cancer. The reduction to the orbit (quite ridiculous here, since the observation itself has an uncertainty of several minutes) requires the addition of about 52\u201c. Therefore, the corrected position was 2\u00b0 28\u2019 Cancer. The latitude, from the table, was 3\u00b0 33\u2019 north.\nOn the same night, the one following December 10, at 12\u2159h, Fabricius in East Frisia found Mars\u2019s position to be 3\u00b0 40\u00bc\u2019 Cancer with latitude 3\u00b0 23\u2019 N. In this observation the longitude comes out nearly the same. For the motion over 3h 40m is 3\u00bd\u2019, so that in the Brahean observation too, at 12\u2159h Mars could have been at 3\u00b0 42\u2019 Cancer\u2014two minutes beyond the Fabrician position.\nX. On 1600 January 13\/23 at 11h 40m, the time being adjusted to Uraniborg time, the planet was observed at 10\u00b0 38\u2019 46\u201c Leo ^21. The sun\u2019s position was 3\u00b0 26\u2019 30\u201c Aquarius. The stars were 7\u00b0 12\u2019 16\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion for the next few days was 1\u00b0 1\u2019 3\u201c; that of Mars, 23\u2019 44\u201c. The sum: 1\u00b0 24\u2019 47\u201c. The opposition therefore followed 5 days 2h 22m after; that is, on January 19\/29 at 2h 2m in the morning, before dawn. Mars was at 8\u00b0 38\u2019 Leo. There is no need for reduction, since it is near the limit. The latitude, from the table, was 4\u00b0 30\u2019 50\u201c N.\nXI. On the evening of 1602 Febr. 18\/28 at 10h 30m, using the Tychonic  instruments (with the help of the learned Matthias Seiffard,22 bequeathed us by Tycho), I took the distance of Mars from the middle star of the tail of Ursa Major 23 to be 52\u00b0 22\u2019. And since the distance between Cor Leonis and Procyon was 37\u00b0 22\u2019 20\u201c, which should have been 37\u00b0 19\u2019 50\u201c,24 we know that the sextant reads 2\u00bd minutes high. Therefore, the corrected distance of Mars from the tail of Ursa was 52\u00b0 19\u00bd\u2019. And since the latitude of the fixed star is 56\u00b0 22\u2019, the remainder, by subtraction, is 4\u00b0 2\u00bd\u2019\u2014supposing that Mars was at precisely the same longitude as the fixed star. But because there was a difference of 3\u00be degrees between them (as is clear from the following observations), a slight correction is required.\n For let AB be 3\u00b0 43\u2019 30\u201c on a parallel close to the ecliptic, B Mars, C the fixed star, and BC 52\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c. Dividing the secant of BC by the secant of AB gives the  secant of CA, 52\u00b0 14\u2019, which, subtracted from 56\u00b0 22\u2019 (the latitude of the fixed star) leaves 4\u00b0 8\u2019 north as Mars\u2019s observed latitude. At the same time, we found 19\u00b0 23\u2019 between Mars and Cor Leonis (19\u00b0 20\u00bd corrected), and 21\u00b0 20\u2019 between Mars and the bright star in the wing of Virgo25 (21\u00b0 17\u00bd\u2019 corrected). From these two distances (using the latitudes of the stars and Mars), Mars\u2019s longitude is found to be 13\u00b0 19\u2019 6\u201c Virgo, by consensus of all measurements.\nAlternatively, the meridian altitude of Mars was found at 12h 40m, using two quadrants, to be 50\u00b0 19\u2019, while the tail of Leo26 was 56\u00b0 45\u2019. Therefore, from the declinations and right ascensions of the fixed stars and our distances, Mars\u2019s position is determined as 13\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c Virgo, latitude 4\u00b0 7\u2019 55\u201c ^27. This is the Tychonic procedure. I have included the other for the sake of showing a consensus, and also that it might be evident that despite the lack of absolute perfection in the demonstration, short cuts either in computation or in our understanding can under certain circumstances be applied. For in that previous procedure there is less in the actual work than in the reporting of it. At Prague, 5\u00b0 Scorpio was rising ^28. Therefore, the nonagesimal was about 32\u00bd\u00b0 from the zenith. And since Mars\u2019s distance from the earth was rather more than half the sun\u2019s distance, the resulting parallax of about 5\u2019 opposite 32\u00bd\u00b0 in our parallactic table, shows a latitudinal parallax of 2\u2019 41\u201c. Thus the latitude as seen from the middle of the earth would be 4\u00b0 10\u2154\u2019 north. And because the altitude of the nonagesimal was 57\u00bd\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax at the horizon was 4\u2019 13\u201c. But since Mars was 38\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, the longitudinal parallax corresponding to this position is 2\u2019 36\u201c, and if this be eliminated, Mars would be placed at about 13\u00b0 18\u2019 Virgo ^29. At that moment, the sun\u2019s position was 10\u00b0 16\u2019 42\u201c Pisces. The distance between the bodies was 3\u00b0 1\u2019 18\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 4\u201c, and that of Mars, 24\u2019 5\u201c (for it was 24\u2019 18\u201c at 21\u00b0 Leo in 1585, and 24\u2019 at 26 Virgo in 1587). The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 24\u2019 9\u201c. The true opposition therefore followed 2 days 3 hours 43 minutes later, on 21 February\/3 March before dawn at 2h 13m, Mars being at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 35\u201c Virgo. Forty seconds must be subtracted to reduce the position to the orbit, putting Mars at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 Virgo, with slightly less latitude than before, since the latitude was then decreasing. It was therefore about 4\u00b0 10\u2019, or 4\u00b0 7\u2153\u2019 if the parallax be neglected.\n But because, since Tycho\u2019s death, we have not made frequent observations nor continued them over several days, it would be best, for certainty\u2019s sake, also to make use of those observations which David Fabricius of East Frisia, a sedulous practitioner of astronomy, has communicated to me.\nOn February 16, old style, at 5h in the morning, he took the planet\u2019s distances from the tail of Leo (for the latitude), from the neck of Leo,30 and, on the other hand, from the bright star in the southern wing of Virgo, so as to check its longitude by working it out twice.\nI could make use of Tycho\u2019s line of reasoning, which he routinely adopted in volume I of the Progymnasmata when (as here) the declination of the planet was not known. But because that method extends to ten operations, I prefer for the sake of brevity to proceed as I did before with my own observations. Here there are no hidden dangers.\nFirst, the star in the wing of Virgo, adjusted to our time, is at 4\u00b0 36\u2019 30\u201c Libra with latitude 2\u00b0 50\u2019 north. Fabricius found that Mars is 20\u00b0 18\u2019 westward from it on the zodiac, which puts Mars at about 14\u00b0 18\u2019 30\u201c Virgo. This is a preliminary, approximate figure: the longitude will shortly be corrected. Now the tail of Leo31 is at 16\u00b0 4\u2019 Virgo, with latitude 12\u00b0 18\u2019 North, and Mars was found to be 8\u00b0 17\u2019 distant from the Tail. What is sought is the distance of its parallel from the Tail, since the difference in longitude is 1\u00b0 45\u2019. Dividing the secant of 8\u00b0 17\u2019 by the secant of 1\u00b0 45\u2019 gives the secant of 8\u00b0 6\u2019, the arc sought. This subtracted from the fixed star\u2019s northern latitude of 12\u00b0 18\u2019 leaves Mars\u2019s latitude, 4\u00b0 12\u2019 north. This I now take as determined, and compare it with the latitudes of the fixed stars according to the laws of trigonometry. From the Wing of Virgo, I find Mars\u2019s longitude to be 14\u00b0 19\u2019 Virgo; from the Neck of Leo, 14\u00b0 23\u2019 36\u201c. The mean of these two is 14\u00b0 21\u2019 18\u201c Virgo. And since the sextant gave distances larger than the truth, the latitude would come out at 4\u00b0 14\u2019 north.\nOn the night following February 23, at 12h, he observed Mars in relation to five fixed stars: the Tail of Leo and Arcturus for latitude, and for the longitude, in the first instance, Spica (which followed it), and, in the second, the Neck of Leo and Cor Leonis (which preceded it).\nBy a rough estimate, I foresee that Mars is going to fall at 11\u00bc\u00b0 Virgo. It was found to be 9\u00b0 24\u2019 from the Tail of Leo, and hence, its latitude comes out at 4\u00b0 6\u2019 ^32. And now, through this and the latitudes of the fixed stars, together with their distances (17\u00b0 26\u2019 from Regulus, 17\u00b0 51\u2019 from the Neck of Leo, 37\u00b0 28\u2019 from Spica, 44\u00b0 15\u2019 from Arcturus), Mars\u2019s position comes out at 11\u00b0 21\u2019 23\u201c Virgo (from Regulus), 11\u00b0 20\u2019 52\u201c Virgo (from the Neck of Leo), and 11\u00b0 17\u2019 40\u201c (from Spica). Again (as you see) the distances err in being too great. For from the Heart and the Neck [of Leo], Mars is pushed a little eastward, and from Spica and Arcturus a little westward, and more from Arcturus, owing to its greater northern latitude ^33. The mean (ignoring Arcturus), 11\u00b0 19\u2019 20\u201c Virgo, is very nearly true. Also, the latitude is greater, namely, 4\u00b0 7\u2019 40\u201c north. Now from February 15 at 17h to 23 February at 12h, a period of 7 days 19 hours, Mars moved 3\u00b0 0\u2019: 180 minutes in 187 hours. That is, about one minute per hour. And if you wish to take it into account, the parallax (if any) is subtracted from the longitude on February 16 and a little is added on February 23.\n Because the last observation follows the time of observation found by me by 2 days 21 hours 47 min., add the motion corresponding to this time, 1\u00b0 7\u2019: the position will come out 12\u00b0 26\u2019 Virgo. The agreement is thus very good\u2014it could not be better\u2014given that both of us [that is, Kepler and Fabricius] work independently and do not rely on the facilities used by Tycho Brahe.","1702":"VIII. On 1595 October 30 at 8h 20m, the planet was found at 17\u00b0 47\u2019 15\u201c Taurus,19 not far from the nonagesimal. We may thus be sure of the parallax, although we must take it into account. The latitude was 0\u00b0 5\u2019 10\u201c north. The sun\u2019s position was 16\u00b0 50\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio. The distance between the stars was 56\u2019 45\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 35\u201c; that of Mars, 22\u2019 54\u201c, as appears by comparing the nearby observations. The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 23\u2019 29\u201c. If the distance between the stars be divided by this, it comes out to 40\u2019 47\u201c of a day, or 16 hours 19 min. Therefore, the true opposition was 0h 39m PM on October 31. Mars\u2019s position was 17\u00b0 31\u2019 40\u201c Taurus. This needs no reduction to the orbit, as it is nearly at the node. The latitude was about 0\u00b0 8\u2019 north. But comparison with the preceding and following days shows a latitude of about 5\u2019 north.\nIX. Let, at any rate, Mars\u2019s position on 1597 December 10 at 8h 30m be 3\u00b0 45\u00bd\u2019 Cancer (as above) ^20. The sun\u2019s position was 29\u00b0 4\u2019 53\u201c Sagittarius. The distance between the stars was 4\u00b0 40\u2019 37\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 61\u2019 20\u201c, that of Mars 23\u2019 40\u201c (for in 1580 the diurnal motion in Gemini was 23\u2019, and in 1582, at 17\u00b0 Cancer, it was 24\u2019). Therefore, the sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 25\u2019 0\u201c. These data show that the time of true opposition followed 3 days 7 hours 14 min. later, on December 14 at 3h 44m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 2\u00b0 27\u2153\u2019 Cancer. The reduction to the orbit (quite ridiculous here, since the observation itself has an uncertainty of several minutes) requires the addition of about 52\u201c. Therefore, the corrected position was 2\u00b0 28\u2019 Cancer. The latitude, from the table, was 3\u00b0 33\u2019 north.\nOn the same night, the one following December 10, at 12\u2159h, Fabricius in East Frisia found Mars\u2019s position to be 3\u00b0 40\u00bc\u2019 Cancer with latitude 3\u00b0 23\u2019 N. In this observation the longitude comes out nearly the same. For the motion over 3h 40m is 3\u00bd\u2019, so that in the Brahean observation too, at 12\u2159h Mars could have been at 3\u00b0 42\u2019 Cancer\u2014two minutes beyond the Fabrician position.\nX. On 1600 January 13\/23 at 11h 40m, the time being adjusted to Uraniborg time, the planet was observed at 10\u00b0 38\u2019 46\u201c Leo ^21. The sun\u2019s position was 3\u00b0 26\u2019 30\u201c Aquarius. The stars were 7\u00b0 12\u2019 16\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion for the next few days was 1\u00b0 1\u2019 3\u201c; that of Mars, 23\u2019 44\u201c. The sum: 1\u00b0 24\u2019 47\u201c. The opposition therefore followed 5 days 2h 22m after; that is, on January 19\/29 at 2h 2m in the morning, before dawn. Mars was at 8\u00b0 38\u2019 Leo. There is no need for reduction, since it is near the limit. The latitude, from the table, was 4\u00b0 30\u2019 50\u201c N.\nXI. On the evening of 1602 Febr. 18\/28 at 10h 30m, using the Tychonic  instruments (with the help of the learned Matthias Seiffard,22 bequeathed us by Tycho), I took the distance of Mars from the middle star of the tail of Ursa Major 23 to be 52\u00b0 22\u2019. And since the distance between Cor Leonis and Procyon was 37\u00b0 22\u2019 20\u201c, which should have been 37\u00b0 19\u2019 50\u201c,24 we know that the sextant reads 2\u00bd minutes high. Therefore, the corrected distance of Mars from the tail of Ursa was 52\u00b0 19\u00bd\u2019. And since the latitude of the fixed star is 56\u00b0 22\u2019, the remainder, by subtraction, is 4\u00b0 2\u00bd\u2019\u2014supposing that Mars was at precisely the same longitude as the fixed star. But because there was a difference of 3\u00be degrees between them (as is clear from the following observations), a slight correction is required.\n For let AB be 3\u00b0 43\u2019 30\u201c on a parallel close to the ecliptic, B Mars, C the fixed star, and BC 52\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c. Dividing the secant of BC by the secant of AB gives the  secant of CA, 52\u00b0 14\u2019, which, subtracted from 56\u00b0 22\u2019 (the latitude of the fixed star) leaves 4\u00b0 8\u2019 north as Mars\u2019s observed latitude. At the same time, we found 19\u00b0 23\u2019 between Mars and Cor Leonis (19\u00b0 20\u00bd corrected), and 21\u00b0 20\u2019 between Mars and the bright star in the wing of Virgo25 (21\u00b0 17\u00bd\u2019 corrected). From these two distances (using the latitudes of the stars and Mars), Mars\u2019s longitude is found to be 13\u00b0 19\u2019 6\u201c Virgo, by consensus of all measurements.\nAlternatively, the meridian altitude of Mars was found at 12h 40m, using two quadrants, to be 50\u00b0 19\u2019, while the tail of Leo26 was 56\u00b0 45\u2019. Therefore, from the declinations and right ascensions of the fixed stars and our distances, Mars\u2019s position is determined as 13\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c Virgo, latitude 4\u00b0 7\u2019 55\u201c ^27. This is the Tychonic procedure. I have included the other for the sake of showing a consensus, and also that it might be evident that despite the lack of absolute perfection in the demonstration, short cuts either in computation or in our understanding can under certain circumstances be applied. For in that previous procedure there is less in the actual work than in the reporting of it. At Prague, 5\u00b0 Scorpio was rising ^28. Therefore, the nonagesimal was about 32\u00bd\u00b0 from the zenith. And since Mars\u2019s distance from the earth was rather more than half the sun\u2019s distance, the resulting parallax of about 5\u2019 opposite 32\u00bd\u00b0 in our parallactic table, shows a latitudinal parallax of 2\u2019 41\u201c. Thus the latitude as seen from the middle of the earth would be 4\u00b0 10\u2154\u2019 north. And because the altitude of the nonagesimal was 57\u00bd\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax at the horizon was 4\u2019 13\u201c. But since Mars was 38\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, the longitudinal parallax corresponding to this position is 2\u2019 36\u201c, and if this be eliminated, Mars would be placed at about 13\u00b0 18\u2019 Virgo ^29. At that moment, the sun\u2019s position was 10\u00b0 16\u2019 42\u201c Pisces. The distance between the bodies was 3\u00b0 1\u2019 18\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 4\u201c, and that of Mars, 24\u2019 5\u201c (for it was 24\u2019 18\u201c at 21\u00b0 Leo in 1585, and 24\u2019 at 26 Virgo in 1587). The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 24\u2019 9\u201c. The true opposition therefore followed 2 days 3 hours 43 minutes later, on 21 February\/3 March before dawn at 2h 13m, Mars being at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 35\u201c Virgo. Forty seconds must be subtracted to reduce the position to the orbit, putting Mars at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 Virgo, with slightly less latitude than before, since the latitude was then decreasing. It was therefore about 4\u00b0 10\u2019, or 4\u00b0 7\u2153\u2019 if the parallax be neglected.\n But because, since Tycho\u2019s death, we have not made frequent observations nor continued them over several days, it would be best, for certainty\u2019s sake, also to make use of those observations which David Fabricius of East Frisia, a sedulous practitioner of astronomy, has communicated to me.\nOn February 16, old style, at 5h in the morning, he took the planet\u2019s distances from the tail of Leo (for the latitude), from the neck of Leo,30 and, on the other hand, from the bright star in the southern wing of Virgo, so as to check its longitude by working it out twice.\nI could make use of Tycho\u2019s line of reasoning, which he routinely adopted in volume I of the Progymnasmata when (as here) the declination of the planet was not known. But because that method extends to ten operations, I prefer for the sake of brevity to proceed as I did before with my own observations. Here there are no hidden dangers.\nFirst, the star in the wing of Virgo, adjusted to our time, is at 4\u00b0 36\u2019 30\u201c Libra with latitude 2\u00b0 50\u2019 north. Fabricius found that Mars is 20\u00b0 18\u2019 westward from it on the zodiac, which puts Mars at about 14\u00b0 18\u2019 30\u201c Virgo. This is a preliminary, approximate figure: the longitude will shortly be corrected. Now the tail of Leo31 is at 16\u00b0 4\u2019 Virgo, with latitude 12\u00b0 18\u2019 North, and Mars was found to be 8\u00b0 17\u2019 distant from the Tail. What is sought is the distance of its parallel from the Tail, since the difference in longitude is 1\u00b0 45\u2019. Dividing the secant of 8\u00b0 17\u2019 by the secant of 1\u00b0 45\u2019 gives the secant of 8\u00b0 6\u2019, the arc sought. This subtracted from the fixed star\u2019s northern latitude of 12\u00b0 18\u2019 leaves Mars\u2019s latitude, 4\u00b0 12\u2019 north. This I now take as determined, and compare it with the latitudes of the fixed stars according to the laws of trigonometry. From the Wing of Virgo, I find Mars\u2019s longitude to be 14\u00b0 19\u2019 Virgo; from the Neck of Leo, 14\u00b0 23\u2019 36\u201c. The mean of these two is 14\u00b0 21\u2019 18\u201c Virgo. And since the sextant gave distances larger than the truth, the latitude would come out at 4\u00b0 14\u2019 north.\nOn the night following February 23, at 12h, he observed Mars in relation to five fixed stars: the Tail of Leo and Arcturus for latitude, and for the longitude, in the first instance, Spica (which followed it), and, in the second, the Neck of Leo and Cor Leonis (which preceded it).\nBy a rough estimate, I foresee that Mars is going to fall at 11\u00bc\u00b0 Virgo. It was found to be 9\u00b0 24\u2019 from the Tail of Leo, and hence, its latitude comes out at 4\u00b0 6\u2019 ^32. And now, through this and the latitudes of the fixed stars, together with their distances (17\u00b0 26\u2019 from Regulus, 17\u00b0 51\u2019 from the Neck of Leo, 37\u00b0 28\u2019 from Spica, 44\u00b0 15\u2019 from Arcturus), Mars\u2019s position comes out at 11\u00b0 21\u2019 23\u201c Virgo (from Regulus), 11\u00b0 20\u2019 52\u201c Virgo (from the Neck of Leo), and 11\u00b0 17\u2019 40\u201c (from Spica). Again (as you see) the distances err in being too great. For from the Heart and the Neck [of Leo], Mars is pushed a little eastward, and from Spica and Arcturus a little westward, and more from Arcturus, owing to its greater northern latitude ^33. The mean (ignoring Arcturus), 11\u00b0 19\u2019 20\u201c Virgo, is very nearly true. Also, the latitude is greater, namely, 4\u00b0 7\u2019 40\u201c north. Now from February 15 at 17h to 23 February at 12h, a period of 7 days 19 hours, Mars moved 3\u00b0 0\u2019: 180 minutes in 187 hours. That is, about one minute per hour. And if you wish to take it into account, the parallax (if any) is subtracted from the longitude on February 16 and a little is added on February 23.\n Because the last observation follows the time of observation found by me by 2 days 21 hours 47 min., add the motion corresponding to this time, 1\u00b0 7\u2019: the position will come out 12\u00b0 26\u2019 Virgo. The agreement is thus very good\u2014it could not be better\u2014given that both of us [that is, Kepler and Fabricius] work independently and do not rely on the facilities used by Tycho Brahe.","1703":"VIII. On 1595 October 30 at 8h 20m, the planet was found at 17\u00b0 47\u2019 15\u201c Taurus,19 not far from the nonagesimal. We may thus be sure of the parallax, although we must take it into account. The latitude was 0\u00b0 5\u2019 10\u201c north. The sun\u2019s position was 16\u00b0 50\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio. The distance between the stars was 56\u2019 45\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 35\u201c; that of Mars, 22\u2019 54\u201c, as appears by comparing the nearby observations. The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 23\u2019 29\u201c. If the distance between the stars be divided by this, it comes out to 40\u2019 47\u201c of a day, or 16 hours 19 min. Therefore, the true opposition was 0h 39m PM on October 31. Mars\u2019s position was 17\u00b0 31\u2019 40\u201c Taurus. This needs no reduction to the orbit, as it is nearly at the node. The latitude was about 0\u00b0 8\u2019 north. But comparison with the preceding and following days shows a latitude of about 5\u2019 north.\nIX. Let, at any rate, Mars\u2019s position on 1597 December 10 at 8h 30m be 3\u00b0 45\u00bd\u2019 Cancer (as above) ^20. The sun\u2019s position was 29\u00b0 4\u2019 53\u201c Sagittarius. The distance between the stars was 4\u00b0 40\u2019 37\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 61\u2019 20\u201c, that of Mars 23\u2019 40\u201c (for in 1580 the diurnal motion in Gemini was 23\u2019, and in 1582, at 17\u00b0 Cancer, it was 24\u2019). Therefore, the sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 25\u2019 0\u201c. These data show that the time of true opposition followed 3 days 7 hours 14 min. later, on December 14 at 3h 44m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 2\u00b0 27\u2153\u2019 Cancer. The reduction to the orbit (quite ridiculous here, since the observation itself has an uncertainty of several minutes) requires the addition of about 52\u201c. Therefore, the corrected position was 2\u00b0 28\u2019 Cancer. The latitude, from the table, was 3\u00b0 33\u2019 north.\nOn the same night, the one following December 10, at 12\u2159h, Fabricius in East Frisia found Mars\u2019s position to be 3\u00b0 40\u00bc\u2019 Cancer with latitude 3\u00b0 23\u2019 N. In this observation the longitude comes out nearly the same. For the motion over 3h 40m is 3\u00bd\u2019, so that in the Brahean observation too, at 12\u2159h Mars could have been at 3\u00b0 42\u2019 Cancer\u2014two minutes beyond the Fabrician position.\nX. On 1600 January 13\/23 at 11h 40m, the time being adjusted to Uraniborg time, the planet was observed at 10\u00b0 38\u2019 46\u201c Leo ^21. The sun\u2019s position was 3\u00b0 26\u2019 30\u201c Aquarius. The stars were 7\u00b0 12\u2019 16\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion for the next few days was 1\u00b0 1\u2019 3\u201c; that of Mars, 23\u2019 44\u201c. The sum: 1\u00b0 24\u2019 47\u201c. The opposition therefore followed 5 days 2h 22m after; that is, on January 19\/29 at 2h 2m in the morning, before dawn. Mars was at 8\u00b0 38\u2019 Leo. There is no need for reduction, since it is near the limit. The latitude, from the table, was 4\u00b0 30\u2019 50\u201c N.\nXI. On the evening of 1602 Febr. 18\/28 at 10h 30m, using the Tychonic  instruments (with the help of the learned Matthias Seiffard,22 bequeathed us by Tycho), I took the distance of Mars from the middle star of the tail of Ursa Major 23 to be 52\u00b0 22\u2019. And since the distance between Cor Leonis and Procyon was 37\u00b0 22\u2019 20\u201c, which should have been 37\u00b0 19\u2019 50\u201c,24 we know that the sextant reads 2\u00bd minutes high. Therefore, the corrected distance of Mars from the tail of Ursa was 52\u00b0 19\u00bd\u2019. And since the latitude of the fixed star is 56\u00b0 22\u2019, the remainder, by subtraction, is 4\u00b0 2\u00bd\u2019\u2014supposing that Mars was at precisely the same longitude as the fixed star. But because there was a difference of 3\u00be degrees between them (as is clear from the following observations), a slight correction is required.\n For let AB be 3\u00b0 43\u2019 30\u201c on a parallel close to the ecliptic, B Mars, C the fixed star, and BC 52\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c. Dividing the secant of BC by the secant of AB gives the  secant of CA, 52\u00b0 14\u2019, which, subtracted from 56\u00b0 22\u2019 (the latitude of the fixed star) leaves 4\u00b0 8\u2019 north as Mars\u2019s observed latitude. At the same time, we found 19\u00b0 23\u2019 between Mars and Cor Leonis (19\u00b0 20\u00bd corrected), and 21\u00b0 20\u2019 between Mars and the bright star in the wing of Virgo25 (21\u00b0 17\u00bd\u2019 corrected). From these two distances (using the latitudes of the stars and Mars), Mars\u2019s longitude is found to be 13\u00b0 19\u2019 6\u201c Virgo, by consensus of all measurements.\nAlternatively, the meridian altitude of Mars was found at 12h 40m, using two quadrants, to be 50\u00b0 19\u2019, while the tail of Leo26 was 56\u00b0 45\u2019. Therefore, from the declinations and right ascensions of the fixed stars and our distances, Mars\u2019s position is determined as 13\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c Virgo, latitude 4\u00b0 7\u2019 55\u201c ^27. This is the Tychonic procedure. I have included the other for the sake of showing a consensus, and also that it might be evident that despite the lack of absolute perfection in the demonstration, short cuts either in computation or in our understanding can under certain circumstances be applied. For in that previous procedure there is less in the actual work than in the reporting of it. At Prague, 5\u00b0 Scorpio was rising ^28. Therefore, the nonagesimal was about 32\u00bd\u00b0 from the zenith. And since Mars\u2019s distance from the earth was rather more than half the sun\u2019s distance, the resulting parallax of about 5\u2019 opposite 32\u00bd\u00b0 in our parallactic table, shows a latitudinal parallax of 2\u2019 41\u201c. Thus the latitude as seen from the middle of the earth would be 4\u00b0 10\u2154\u2019 north. And because the altitude of the nonagesimal was 57\u00bd\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax at the horizon was 4\u2019 13\u201c. But since Mars was 38\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, the longitudinal parallax corresponding to this position is 2\u2019 36\u201c, and if this be eliminated, Mars would be placed at about 13\u00b0 18\u2019 Virgo ^29. At that moment, the sun\u2019s position was 10\u00b0 16\u2019 42\u201c Pisces. The distance between the bodies was 3\u00b0 1\u2019 18\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 4\u201c, and that of Mars, 24\u2019 5\u201c (for it was 24\u2019 18\u201c at 21\u00b0 Leo in 1585, and 24\u2019 at 26 Virgo in 1587). The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 24\u2019 9\u201c. The true opposition therefore followed 2 days 3 hours 43 minutes later, on 21 February\/3 March before dawn at 2h 13m, Mars being at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 35\u201c Virgo. Forty seconds must be subtracted to reduce the position to the orbit, putting Mars at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 Virgo, with slightly less latitude than before, since the latitude was then decreasing. It was therefore about 4\u00b0 10\u2019, or 4\u00b0 7\u2153\u2019 if the parallax be neglected.\n But because, since Tycho\u2019s death, we have not made frequent observations nor continued them over several days, it would be best, for certainty\u2019s sake, also to make use of those observations which David Fabricius of East Frisia, a sedulous practitioner of astronomy, has communicated to me.\nOn February 16, old style, at 5h in the morning, he took the planet\u2019s distances from the tail of Leo (for the latitude), from the neck of Leo,30 and, on the other hand, from the bright star in the southern wing of Virgo, so as to check its longitude by working it out twice.\nI could make use of Tycho\u2019s line of reasoning, which he routinely adopted in volume I of the Progymnasmata when (as here) the declination of the planet was not known. But because that method extends to ten operations, I prefer for the sake of brevity to proceed as I did before with my own observations. Here there are no hidden dangers.\nFirst, the star in the wing of Virgo, adjusted to our time, is at 4\u00b0 36\u2019 30\u201c Libra with latitude 2\u00b0 50\u2019 north. Fabricius found that Mars is 20\u00b0 18\u2019 westward from it on the zodiac, which puts Mars at about 14\u00b0 18\u2019 30\u201c Virgo. This is a preliminary, approximate figure: the longitude will shortly be corrected. Now the tail of Leo31 is at 16\u00b0 4\u2019 Virgo, with latitude 12\u00b0 18\u2019 North, and Mars was found to be 8\u00b0 17\u2019 distant from the Tail. What is sought is the distance of its parallel from the Tail, since the difference in longitude is 1\u00b0 45\u2019. Dividing the secant of 8\u00b0 17\u2019 by the secant of 1\u00b0 45\u2019 gives the secant of 8\u00b0 6\u2019, the arc sought. This subtracted from the fixed star\u2019s northern latitude of 12\u00b0 18\u2019 leaves Mars\u2019s latitude, 4\u00b0 12\u2019 north. This I now take as determined, and compare it with the latitudes of the fixed stars according to the laws of trigonometry. From the Wing of Virgo, I find Mars\u2019s longitude to be 14\u00b0 19\u2019 Virgo; from the Neck of Leo, 14\u00b0 23\u2019 36\u201c. The mean of these two is 14\u00b0 21\u2019 18\u201c Virgo. And since the sextant gave distances larger than the truth, the latitude would come out at 4\u00b0 14\u2019 north.\nOn the night following February 23, at 12h, he observed Mars in relation to five fixed stars: the Tail of Leo and Arcturus for latitude, and for the longitude, in the first instance, Spica (which followed it), and, in the second, the Neck of Leo and Cor Leonis (which preceded it).\nBy a rough estimate, I foresee that Mars is going to fall at 11\u00bc\u00b0 Virgo. It was found to be 9\u00b0 24\u2019 from the Tail of Leo, and hence, its latitude comes out at 4\u00b0 6\u2019 ^32. And now, through this and the latitudes of the fixed stars, together with their distances (17\u00b0 26\u2019 from Regulus, 17\u00b0 51\u2019 from the Neck of Leo, 37\u00b0 28\u2019 from Spica, 44\u00b0 15\u2019 from Arcturus), Mars\u2019s position comes out at 11\u00b0 21\u2019 23\u201c Virgo (from Regulus), 11\u00b0 20\u2019 52\u201c Virgo (from the Neck of Leo), and 11\u00b0 17\u2019 40\u201c (from Spica). Again (as you see) the distances err in being too great. For from the Heart and the Neck [of Leo], Mars is pushed a little eastward, and from Spica and Arcturus a little westward, and more from Arcturus, owing to its greater northern latitude ^33. The mean (ignoring Arcturus), 11\u00b0 19\u2019 20\u201c Virgo, is very nearly true. Also, the latitude is greater, namely, 4\u00b0 7\u2019 40\u201c north. Now from February 15 at 17h to 23 February at 12h, a period of 7 days 19 hours, Mars moved 3\u00b0 0\u2019: 180 minutes in 187 hours. That is, about one minute per hour. And if you wish to take it into account, the parallax (if any) is subtracted from the longitude on February 16 and a little is added on February 23.\n Because the last observation follows the time of observation found by me by 2 days 21 hours 47 min., add the motion corresponding to this time, 1\u00b0 7\u2019: the position will come out 12\u00b0 26\u2019 Virgo. The agreement is thus very good\u2014it could not be better\u2014given that both of us [that is, Kepler and Fabricius] work independently and do not rely on the facilities used by Tycho Brahe.","1704":"VIII. On 1595 October 30 at 8h 20m, the planet was found at 17\u00b0 47\u2019 15\u201c Taurus,19 not far from the nonagesimal. We may thus be sure of the parallax, although we must take it into account. The latitude was 0\u00b0 5\u2019 10\u201c north. The sun\u2019s position was 16\u00b0 50\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio. The distance between the stars was 56\u2019 45\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 35\u201c; that of Mars, 22\u2019 54\u201c, as appears by comparing the nearby observations. The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 23\u2019 29\u201c. If the distance between the stars be divided by this, it comes out to 40\u2019 47\u201c of a day, or 16 hours 19 min. Therefore, the true opposition was 0h 39m PM on October 31. Mars\u2019s position was 17\u00b0 31\u2019 40\u201c Taurus. This needs no reduction to the orbit, as it is nearly at the node. The latitude was about 0\u00b0 8\u2019 north. But comparison with the preceding and following days shows a latitude of about 5\u2019 north.\nIX. Let, at any rate, Mars\u2019s position on 1597 December 10 at 8h 30m be 3\u00b0 45\u00bd\u2019 Cancer (as above) ^20. The sun\u2019s position was 29\u00b0 4\u2019 53\u201c Sagittarius. The distance between the stars was 4\u00b0 40\u2019 37\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 61\u2019 20\u201c, that of Mars 23\u2019 40\u201c (for in 1580 the diurnal motion in Gemini was 23\u2019, and in 1582, at 17\u00b0 Cancer, it was 24\u2019). Therefore, the sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 25\u2019 0\u201c. These data show that the time of true opposition followed 3 days 7 hours 14 min. later, on December 14 at 3h 44m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 2\u00b0 27\u2153\u2019 Cancer. The reduction to the orbit (quite ridiculous here, since the observation itself has an uncertainty of several minutes) requires the addition of about 52\u201c. Therefore, the corrected position was 2\u00b0 28\u2019 Cancer. The latitude, from the table, was 3\u00b0 33\u2019 north.\nOn the same night, the one following December 10, at 12\u2159h, Fabricius in East Frisia found Mars\u2019s position to be 3\u00b0 40\u00bc\u2019 Cancer with latitude 3\u00b0 23\u2019 N. In this observation the longitude comes out nearly the same. For the motion over 3h 40m is 3\u00bd\u2019, so that in the Brahean observation too, at 12\u2159h Mars could have been at 3\u00b0 42\u2019 Cancer\u2014two minutes beyond the Fabrician position.\nX. On 1600 January 13\/23 at 11h 40m, the time being adjusted to Uraniborg time, the planet was observed at 10\u00b0 38\u2019 46\u201c Leo ^21. The sun\u2019s position was 3\u00b0 26\u2019 30\u201c Aquarius. The stars were 7\u00b0 12\u2019 16\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion for the next few days was 1\u00b0 1\u2019 3\u201c; that of Mars, 23\u2019 44\u201c. The sum: 1\u00b0 24\u2019 47\u201c. The opposition therefore followed 5 days 2h 22m after; that is, on January 19\/29 at 2h 2m in the morning, before dawn. Mars was at 8\u00b0 38\u2019 Leo. There is no need for reduction, since it is near the limit. The latitude, from the table, was 4\u00b0 30\u2019 50\u201c N.\nXI. On the evening of 1602 Febr. 18\/28 at 10h 30m, using the Tychonic  instruments (with the help of the learned Matthias Seiffard,22 bequeathed us by Tycho), I took the distance of Mars from the middle star of the tail of Ursa Major 23 to be 52\u00b0 22\u2019. And since the distance between Cor Leonis and Procyon was 37\u00b0 22\u2019 20\u201c, which should have been 37\u00b0 19\u2019 50\u201c,24 we know that the sextant reads 2\u00bd minutes high. Therefore, the corrected distance of Mars from the tail of Ursa was 52\u00b0 19\u00bd\u2019. And since the latitude of the fixed star is 56\u00b0 22\u2019, the remainder, by subtraction, is 4\u00b0 2\u00bd\u2019\u2014supposing that Mars was at precisely the same longitude as the fixed star. But because there was a difference of 3\u00be degrees between them (as is clear from the following observations), a slight correction is required.\n For let AB be 3\u00b0 43\u2019 30\u201c on a parallel close to the ecliptic, B Mars, C the fixed star, and BC 52\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c. Dividing the secant of BC by the secant of AB gives the  secant of CA, 52\u00b0 14\u2019, which, subtracted from 56\u00b0 22\u2019 (the latitude of the fixed star) leaves 4\u00b0 8\u2019 north as Mars\u2019s observed latitude. At the same time, we found 19\u00b0 23\u2019 between Mars and Cor Leonis (19\u00b0 20\u00bd corrected), and 21\u00b0 20\u2019 between Mars and the bright star in the wing of Virgo25 (21\u00b0 17\u00bd\u2019 corrected). From these two distances (using the latitudes of the stars and Mars), Mars\u2019s longitude is found to be 13\u00b0 19\u2019 6\u201c Virgo, by consensus of all measurements.\nAlternatively, the meridian altitude of Mars was found at 12h 40m, using two quadrants, to be 50\u00b0 19\u2019, while the tail of Leo26 was 56\u00b0 45\u2019. Therefore, from the declinations and right ascensions of the fixed stars and our distances, Mars\u2019s position is determined as 13\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c Virgo, latitude 4\u00b0 7\u2019 55\u201c ^27. This is the Tychonic procedure. I have included the other for the sake of showing a consensus, and also that it might be evident that despite the lack of absolute perfection in the demonstration, short cuts either in computation or in our understanding can under certain circumstances be applied. For in that previous procedure there is less in the actual work than in the reporting of it. At Prague, 5\u00b0 Scorpio was rising ^28. Therefore, the nonagesimal was about 32\u00bd\u00b0 from the zenith. And since Mars\u2019s distance from the earth was rather more than half the sun\u2019s distance, the resulting parallax of about 5\u2019 opposite 32\u00bd\u00b0 in our parallactic table, shows a latitudinal parallax of 2\u2019 41\u201c. Thus the latitude as seen from the middle of the earth would be 4\u00b0 10\u2154\u2019 north. And because the altitude of the nonagesimal was 57\u00bd\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax at the horizon was 4\u2019 13\u201c. But since Mars was 38\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, the longitudinal parallax corresponding to this position is 2\u2019 36\u201c, and if this be eliminated, Mars would be placed at about 13\u00b0 18\u2019 Virgo ^29. At that moment, the sun\u2019s position was 10\u00b0 16\u2019 42\u201c Pisces. The distance between the bodies was 3\u00b0 1\u2019 18\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 4\u201c, and that of Mars, 24\u2019 5\u201c (for it was 24\u2019 18\u201c at 21\u00b0 Leo in 1585, and 24\u2019 at 26 Virgo in 1587). The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 24\u2019 9\u201c. The true opposition therefore followed 2 days 3 hours 43 minutes later, on 21 February\/3 March before dawn at 2h 13m, Mars being at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 35\u201c Virgo. Forty seconds must be subtracted to reduce the position to the orbit, putting Mars at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 Virgo, with slightly less latitude than before, since the latitude was then decreasing. It was therefore about 4\u00b0 10\u2019, or 4\u00b0 7\u2153\u2019 if the parallax be neglected.\n But because, since Tycho\u2019s death, we have not made frequent observations nor continued them over several days, it would be best, for certainty\u2019s sake, also to make use of those observations which David Fabricius of East Frisia, a sedulous practitioner of astronomy, has communicated to me.\nOn February 16, old style, at 5h in the morning, he took the planet\u2019s distances from the tail of Leo (for the latitude), from the neck of Leo,30 and, on the other hand, from the bright star in the southern wing of Virgo, so as to check its longitude by working it out twice.\nI could make use of Tycho\u2019s line of reasoning, which he routinely adopted in volume I of the Progymnasmata when (as here) the declination of the planet was not known. But because that method extends to ten operations, I prefer for the sake of brevity to proceed as I did before with my own observations. Here there are no hidden dangers.\nFirst, the star in the wing of Virgo, adjusted to our time, is at 4\u00b0 36\u2019 30\u201c Libra with latitude 2\u00b0 50\u2019 north. Fabricius found that Mars is 20\u00b0 18\u2019 westward from it on the zodiac, which puts Mars at about 14\u00b0 18\u2019 30\u201c Virgo. This is a preliminary, approximate figure: the longitude will shortly be corrected. Now the tail of Leo31 is at 16\u00b0 4\u2019 Virgo, with latitude 12\u00b0 18\u2019 North, and Mars was found to be 8\u00b0 17\u2019 distant from the Tail. What is sought is the distance of its parallel from the Tail, since the difference in longitude is 1\u00b0 45\u2019. Dividing the secant of 8\u00b0 17\u2019 by the secant of 1\u00b0 45\u2019 gives the secant of 8\u00b0 6\u2019, the arc sought. This subtracted from the fixed star\u2019s northern latitude of 12\u00b0 18\u2019 leaves Mars\u2019s latitude, 4\u00b0 12\u2019 north. This I now take as determined, and compare it with the latitudes of the fixed stars according to the laws of trigonometry. From the Wing of Virgo, I find Mars\u2019s longitude to be 14\u00b0 19\u2019 Virgo; from the Neck of Leo, 14\u00b0 23\u2019 36\u201c. The mean of these two is 14\u00b0 21\u2019 18\u201c Virgo. And since the sextant gave distances larger than the truth, the latitude would come out at 4\u00b0 14\u2019 north.\nOn the night following February 23, at 12h, he observed Mars in relation to five fixed stars: the Tail of Leo and Arcturus for latitude, and for the longitude, in the first instance, Spica (which followed it), and, in the second, the Neck of Leo and Cor Leonis (which preceded it).\nBy a rough estimate, I foresee that Mars is going to fall at 11\u00bc\u00b0 Virgo. It was found to be 9\u00b0 24\u2019 from the Tail of Leo, and hence, its latitude comes out at 4\u00b0 6\u2019 ^32. And now, through this and the latitudes of the fixed stars, together with their distances (17\u00b0 26\u2019 from Regulus, 17\u00b0 51\u2019 from the Neck of Leo, 37\u00b0 28\u2019 from Spica, 44\u00b0 15\u2019 from Arcturus), Mars\u2019s position comes out at 11\u00b0 21\u2019 23\u201c Virgo (from Regulus), 11\u00b0 20\u2019 52\u201c Virgo (from the Neck of Leo), and 11\u00b0 17\u2019 40\u201c (from Spica). Again (as you see) the distances err in being too great. For from the Heart and the Neck [of Leo], Mars is pushed a little eastward, and from Spica and Arcturus a little westward, and more from Arcturus, owing to its greater northern latitude ^33. The mean (ignoring Arcturus), 11\u00b0 19\u2019 20\u201c Virgo, is very nearly true. Also, the latitude is greater, namely, 4\u00b0 7\u2019 40\u201c north. Now from February 15 at 17h to 23 February at 12h, a period of 7 days 19 hours, Mars moved 3\u00b0 0\u2019: 180 minutes in 187 hours. That is, about one minute per hour. And if you wish to take it into account, the parallax (if any) is subtracted from the longitude on February 16 and a little is added on February 23.\n Because the last observation follows the time of observation found by me by 2 days 21 hours 47 min., add the motion corresponding to this time, 1\u00b0 7\u2019: the position will come out 12\u00b0 26\u2019 Virgo. The agreement is thus very good\u2014it could not be better\u2014given that both of us [that is, Kepler and Fabricius] work independently and do not rely on the facilities used by Tycho Brahe.","1705":"VIII. On 1595 October 30 at 8h 20m, the planet was found at 17\u00b0 47\u2019 15\u201c Taurus,19 not far from the nonagesimal. We may thus be sure of the parallax, although we must take it into account. The latitude was 0\u00b0 5\u2019 10\u201c north. The sun\u2019s position was 16\u00b0 50\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio. The distance between the stars was 56\u2019 45\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 35\u201c; that of Mars, 22\u2019 54\u201c, as appears by comparing the nearby observations. The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 23\u2019 29\u201c. If the distance between the stars be divided by this, it comes out to 40\u2019 47\u201c of a day, or 16 hours 19 min. Therefore, the true opposition was 0h 39m PM on October 31. Mars\u2019s position was 17\u00b0 31\u2019 40\u201c Taurus. This needs no reduction to the orbit, as it is nearly at the node. The latitude was about 0\u00b0 8\u2019 north. But comparison with the preceding and following days shows a latitude of about 5\u2019 north.\nIX. Let, at any rate, Mars\u2019s position on 1597 December 10 at 8h 30m be 3\u00b0 45\u00bd\u2019 Cancer (as above) ^20. The sun\u2019s position was 29\u00b0 4\u2019 53\u201c Sagittarius. The distance between the stars was 4\u00b0 40\u2019 37\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 61\u2019 20\u201c, that of Mars 23\u2019 40\u201c (for in 1580 the diurnal motion in Gemini was 23\u2019, and in 1582, at 17\u00b0 Cancer, it was 24\u2019). Therefore, the sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 25\u2019 0\u201c. These data show that the time of true opposition followed 3 days 7 hours 14 min. later, on December 14 at 3h 44m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 2\u00b0 27\u2153\u2019 Cancer. The reduction to the orbit (quite ridiculous here, since the observation itself has an uncertainty of several minutes) requires the addition of about 52\u201c. Therefore, the corrected position was 2\u00b0 28\u2019 Cancer. The latitude, from the table, was 3\u00b0 33\u2019 north.\nOn the same night, the one following December 10, at 12\u2159h, Fabricius in East Frisia found Mars\u2019s position to be 3\u00b0 40\u00bc\u2019 Cancer with latitude 3\u00b0 23\u2019 N. In this observation the longitude comes out nearly the same. For the motion over 3h 40m is 3\u00bd\u2019, so that in the Brahean observation too, at 12\u2159h Mars could have been at 3\u00b0 42\u2019 Cancer\u2014two minutes beyond the Fabrician position.\nX. On 1600 January 13\/23 at 11h 40m, the time being adjusted to Uraniborg time, the planet was observed at 10\u00b0 38\u2019 46\u201c Leo ^21. The sun\u2019s position was 3\u00b0 26\u2019 30\u201c Aquarius. The stars were 7\u00b0 12\u2019 16\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion for the next few days was 1\u00b0 1\u2019 3\u201c; that of Mars, 23\u2019 44\u201c. The sum: 1\u00b0 24\u2019 47\u201c. The opposition therefore followed 5 days 2h 22m after; that is, on January 19\/29 at 2h 2m in the morning, before dawn. Mars was at 8\u00b0 38\u2019 Leo. There is no need for reduction, since it is near the limit. The latitude, from the table, was 4\u00b0 30\u2019 50\u201c N.\nXI. On the evening of 1602 Febr. 18\/28 at 10h 30m, using the Tychonic  instruments (with the help of the learned Matthias Seiffard,22 bequeathed us by Tycho), I took the distance of Mars from the middle star of the tail of Ursa Major 23 to be 52\u00b0 22\u2019. And since the distance between Cor Leonis and Procyon was 37\u00b0 22\u2019 20\u201c, which should have been 37\u00b0 19\u2019 50\u201c,24 we know that the sextant reads 2\u00bd minutes high. Therefore, the corrected distance of Mars from the tail of Ursa was 52\u00b0 19\u00bd\u2019. And since the latitude of the fixed star is 56\u00b0 22\u2019, the remainder, by subtraction, is 4\u00b0 2\u00bd\u2019\u2014supposing that Mars was at precisely the same longitude as the fixed star. But because there was a difference of 3\u00be degrees between them (as is clear from the following observations), a slight correction is required.\n For let AB be 3\u00b0 43\u2019 30\u201c on a parallel close to the ecliptic, B Mars, C the fixed star, and BC 52\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c. Dividing the secant of BC by the secant of AB gives the  secant of CA, 52\u00b0 14\u2019, which, subtracted from 56\u00b0 22\u2019 (the latitude of the fixed star) leaves 4\u00b0 8\u2019 north as Mars\u2019s observed latitude. At the same time, we found 19\u00b0 23\u2019 between Mars and Cor Leonis (19\u00b0 20\u00bd corrected), and 21\u00b0 20\u2019 between Mars and the bright star in the wing of Virgo25 (21\u00b0 17\u00bd\u2019 corrected). From these two distances (using the latitudes of the stars and Mars), Mars\u2019s longitude is found to be 13\u00b0 19\u2019 6\u201c Virgo, by consensus of all measurements.\nAlternatively, the meridian altitude of Mars was found at 12h 40m, using two quadrants, to be 50\u00b0 19\u2019, while the tail of Leo26 was 56\u00b0 45\u2019. Therefore, from the declinations and right ascensions of the fixed stars and our distances, Mars\u2019s position is determined as 13\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c Virgo, latitude 4\u00b0 7\u2019 55\u201c ^27. This is the Tychonic procedure. I have included the other for the sake of showing a consensus, and also that it might be evident that despite the lack of absolute perfection in the demonstration, short cuts either in computation or in our understanding can under certain circumstances be applied. For in that previous procedure there is less in the actual work than in the reporting of it. At Prague, 5\u00b0 Scorpio was rising ^28. Therefore, the nonagesimal was about 32\u00bd\u00b0 from the zenith. And since Mars\u2019s distance from the earth was rather more than half the sun\u2019s distance, the resulting parallax of about 5\u2019 opposite 32\u00bd\u00b0 in our parallactic table, shows a latitudinal parallax of 2\u2019 41\u201c. Thus the latitude as seen from the middle of the earth would be 4\u00b0 10\u2154\u2019 north. And because the altitude of the nonagesimal was 57\u00bd\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax at the horizon was 4\u2019 13\u201c. But since Mars was 38\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, the longitudinal parallax corresponding to this position is 2\u2019 36\u201c, and if this be eliminated, Mars would be placed at about 13\u00b0 18\u2019 Virgo ^29. At that moment, the sun\u2019s position was 10\u00b0 16\u2019 42\u201c Pisces. The distance between the bodies was 3\u00b0 1\u2019 18\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 4\u201c, and that of Mars, 24\u2019 5\u201c (for it was 24\u2019 18\u201c at 21\u00b0 Leo in 1585, and 24\u2019 at 26 Virgo in 1587). The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 24\u2019 9\u201c. The true opposition therefore followed 2 days 3 hours 43 minutes later, on 21 February\/3 March before dawn at 2h 13m, Mars being at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 35\u201c Virgo. Forty seconds must be subtracted to reduce the position to the orbit, putting Mars at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 Virgo, with slightly less latitude than before, since the latitude was then decreasing. It was therefore about 4\u00b0 10\u2019, or 4\u00b0 7\u2153\u2019 if the parallax be neglected.\n But because, since Tycho\u2019s death, we have not made frequent observations nor continued them over several days, it would be best, for certainty\u2019s sake, also to make use of those observations which David Fabricius of East Frisia, a sedulous practitioner of astronomy, has communicated to me.\nOn February 16, old style, at 5h in the morning, he took the planet\u2019s distances from the tail of Leo (for the latitude), from the neck of Leo,30 and, on the other hand, from the bright star in the southern wing of Virgo, so as to check its longitude by working it out twice.\nI could make use of Tycho\u2019s line of reasoning, which he routinely adopted in volume I of the Progymnasmata when (as here) the declination of the planet was not known. But because that method extends to ten operations, I prefer for the sake of brevity to proceed as I did before with my own observations. Here there are no hidden dangers.\nFirst, the star in the wing of Virgo, adjusted to our time, is at 4\u00b0 36\u2019 30\u201c Libra with latitude 2\u00b0 50\u2019 north. Fabricius found that Mars is 20\u00b0 18\u2019 westward from it on the zodiac, which puts Mars at about 14\u00b0 18\u2019 30\u201c Virgo. This is a preliminary, approximate figure: the longitude will shortly be corrected. Now the tail of Leo31 is at 16\u00b0 4\u2019 Virgo, with latitude 12\u00b0 18\u2019 North, and Mars was found to be 8\u00b0 17\u2019 distant from the Tail. What is sought is the distance of its parallel from the Tail, since the difference in longitude is 1\u00b0 45\u2019. Dividing the secant of 8\u00b0 17\u2019 by the secant of 1\u00b0 45\u2019 gives the secant of 8\u00b0 6\u2019, the arc sought. This subtracted from the fixed star\u2019s northern latitude of 12\u00b0 18\u2019 leaves Mars\u2019s latitude, 4\u00b0 12\u2019 north. This I now take as determined, and compare it with the latitudes of the fixed stars according to the laws of trigonometry. From the Wing of Virgo, I find Mars\u2019s longitude to be 14\u00b0 19\u2019 Virgo; from the Neck of Leo, 14\u00b0 23\u2019 36\u201c. The mean of these two is 14\u00b0 21\u2019 18\u201c Virgo. And since the sextant gave distances larger than the truth, the latitude would come out at 4\u00b0 14\u2019 north.\nOn the night following February 23, at 12h, he observed Mars in relation to five fixed stars: the Tail of Leo and Arcturus for latitude, and for the longitude, in the first instance, Spica (which followed it), and, in the second, the Neck of Leo and Cor Leonis (which preceded it).\nBy a rough estimate, I foresee that Mars is going to fall at 11\u00bc\u00b0 Virgo. It was found to be 9\u00b0 24\u2019 from the Tail of Leo, and hence, its latitude comes out at 4\u00b0 6\u2019 ^32. And now, through this and the latitudes of the fixed stars, together with their distances (17\u00b0 26\u2019 from Regulus, 17\u00b0 51\u2019 from the Neck of Leo, 37\u00b0 28\u2019 from Spica, 44\u00b0 15\u2019 from Arcturus), Mars\u2019s position comes out at 11\u00b0 21\u2019 23\u201c Virgo (from Regulus), 11\u00b0 20\u2019 52\u201c Virgo (from the Neck of Leo), and 11\u00b0 17\u2019 40\u201c (from Spica). Again (as you see) the distances err in being too great. For from the Heart and the Neck [of Leo], Mars is pushed a little eastward, and from Spica and Arcturus a little westward, and more from Arcturus, owing to its greater northern latitude ^33. The mean (ignoring Arcturus), 11\u00b0 19\u2019 20\u201c Virgo, is very nearly true. Also, the latitude is greater, namely, 4\u00b0 7\u2019 40\u201c north. Now from February 15 at 17h to 23 February at 12h, a period of 7 days 19 hours, Mars moved 3\u00b0 0\u2019: 180 minutes in 187 hours. That is, about one minute per hour. And if you wish to take it into account, the parallax (if any) is subtracted from the longitude on February 16 and a little is added on February 23.\n Because the last observation follows the time of observation found by me by 2 days 21 hours 47 min., add the motion corresponding to this time, 1\u00b0 7\u2019: the position will come out 12\u00b0 26\u2019 Virgo. The agreement is thus very good\u2014it could not be better\u2014given that both of us [that is, Kepler and Fabricius] work independently and do not rely on the facilities used by Tycho Brahe.","1706":"VIII. On 1595 October 30 at 8h 20m, the planet was found at 17\u00b0 47\u2019 15\u201c Taurus,19 not far from the nonagesimal. We may thus be sure of the parallax, although we must take it into account. The latitude was 0\u00b0 5\u2019 10\u201c north. The sun\u2019s position was 16\u00b0 50\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio. The distance between the stars was 56\u2019 45\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 35\u201c; that of Mars, 22\u2019 54\u201c, as appears by comparing the nearby observations. The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 23\u2019 29\u201c. If the distance between the stars be divided by this, it comes out to 40\u2019 47\u201c of a day, or 16 hours 19 min. Therefore, the true opposition was 0h 39m PM on October 31. Mars\u2019s position was 17\u00b0 31\u2019 40\u201c Taurus. This needs no reduction to the orbit, as it is nearly at the node. The latitude was about 0\u00b0 8\u2019 north. But comparison with the preceding and following days shows a latitude of about 5\u2019 north.\nIX. Let, at any rate, Mars\u2019s position on 1597 December 10 at 8h 30m be 3\u00b0 45\u00bd\u2019 Cancer (as above) ^20. The sun\u2019s position was 29\u00b0 4\u2019 53\u201c Sagittarius. The distance between the stars was 4\u00b0 40\u2019 37\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 61\u2019 20\u201c, that of Mars 23\u2019 40\u201c (for in 1580 the diurnal motion in Gemini was 23\u2019, and in 1582, at 17\u00b0 Cancer, it was 24\u2019). Therefore, the sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 25\u2019 0\u201c. These data show that the time of true opposition followed 3 days 7 hours 14 min. later, on December 14 at 3h 44m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 2\u00b0 27\u2153\u2019 Cancer. The reduction to the orbit (quite ridiculous here, since the observation itself has an uncertainty of several minutes) requires the addition of about 52\u201c. Therefore, the corrected position was 2\u00b0 28\u2019 Cancer. The latitude, from the table, was 3\u00b0 33\u2019 north.\nOn the same night, the one following December 10, at 12\u2159h, Fabricius in East Frisia found Mars\u2019s position to be 3\u00b0 40\u00bc\u2019 Cancer with latitude 3\u00b0 23\u2019 N. In this observation the longitude comes out nearly the same. For the motion over 3h 40m is 3\u00bd\u2019, so that in the Brahean observation too, at 12\u2159h Mars could have been at 3\u00b0 42\u2019 Cancer\u2014two minutes beyond the Fabrician position.\nX. On 1600 January 13\/23 at 11h 40m, the time being adjusted to Uraniborg time, the planet was observed at 10\u00b0 38\u2019 46\u201c Leo ^21. The sun\u2019s position was 3\u00b0 26\u2019 30\u201c Aquarius. The stars were 7\u00b0 12\u2019 16\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion for the next few days was 1\u00b0 1\u2019 3\u201c; that of Mars, 23\u2019 44\u201c. The sum: 1\u00b0 24\u2019 47\u201c. The opposition therefore followed 5 days 2h 22m after; that is, on January 19\/29 at 2h 2m in the morning, before dawn. Mars was at 8\u00b0 38\u2019 Leo. There is no need for reduction, since it is near the limit. The latitude, from the table, was 4\u00b0 30\u2019 50\u201c N.\nXI. On the evening of 1602 Febr. 18\/28 at 10h 30m, using the Tychonic  instruments (with the help of the learned Matthias Seiffard,22 bequeathed us by Tycho), I took the distance of Mars from the middle star of the tail of Ursa Major 23 to be 52\u00b0 22\u2019. And since the distance between Cor Leonis and Procyon was 37\u00b0 22\u2019 20\u201c, which should have been 37\u00b0 19\u2019 50\u201c,24 we know that the sextant reads 2\u00bd minutes high. Therefore, the corrected distance of Mars from the tail of Ursa was 52\u00b0 19\u00bd\u2019. And since the latitude of the fixed star is 56\u00b0 22\u2019, the remainder, by subtraction, is 4\u00b0 2\u00bd\u2019\u2014supposing that Mars was at precisely the same longitude as the fixed star. But because there was a difference of 3\u00be degrees between them (as is clear from the following observations), a slight correction is required.\n For let AB be 3\u00b0 43\u2019 30\u201c on a parallel close to the ecliptic, B Mars, C the fixed star, and BC 52\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c. Dividing the secant of BC by the secant of AB gives the  secant of CA, 52\u00b0 14\u2019, which, subtracted from 56\u00b0 22\u2019 (the latitude of the fixed star) leaves 4\u00b0 8\u2019 north as Mars\u2019s observed latitude. At the same time, we found 19\u00b0 23\u2019 between Mars and Cor Leonis (19\u00b0 20\u00bd corrected), and 21\u00b0 20\u2019 between Mars and the bright star in the wing of Virgo25 (21\u00b0 17\u00bd\u2019 corrected). From these two distances (using the latitudes of the stars and Mars), Mars\u2019s longitude is found to be 13\u00b0 19\u2019 6\u201c Virgo, by consensus of all measurements.\nAlternatively, the meridian altitude of Mars was found at 12h 40m, using two quadrants, to be 50\u00b0 19\u2019, while the tail of Leo26 was 56\u00b0 45\u2019. Therefore, from the declinations and right ascensions of the fixed stars and our distances, Mars\u2019s position is determined as 13\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c Virgo, latitude 4\u00b0 7\u2019 55\u201c ^27. This is the Tychonic procedure. I have included the other for the sake of showing a consensus, and also that it might be evident that despite the lack of absolute perfection in the demonstration, short cuts either in computation or in our understanding can under certain circumstances be applied. For in that previous procedure there is less in the actual work than in the reporting of it. At Prague, 5\u00b0 Scorpio was rising ^28. Therefore, the nonagesimal was about 32\u00bd\u00b0 from the zenith. And since Mars\u2019s distance from the earth was rather more than half the sun\u2019s distance, the resulting parallax of about 5\u2019 opposite 32\u00bd\u00b0 in our parallactic table, shows a latitudinal parallax of 2\u2019 41\u201c. Thus the latitude as seen from the middle of the earth would be 4\u00b0 10\u2154\u2019 north. And because the altitude of the nonagesimal was 57\u00bd\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax at the horizon was 4\u2019 13\u201c. But since Mars was 38\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, the longitudinal parallax corresponding to this position is 2\u2019 36\u201c, and if this be eliminated, Mars would be placed at about 13\u00b0 18\u2019 Virgo ^29. At that moment, the sun\u2019s position was 10\u00b0 16\u2019 42\u201c Pisces. The distance between the bodies was 3\u00b0 1\u2019 18\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 4\u201c, and that of Mars, 24\u2019 5\u201c (for it was 24\u2019 18\u201c at 21\u00b0 Leo in 1585, and 24\u2019 at 26 Virgo in 1587). The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 24\u2019 9\u201c. The true opposition therefore followed 2 days 3 hours 43 minutes later, on 21 February\/3 March before dawn at 2h 13m, Mars being at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 35\u201c Virgo. Forty seconds must be subtracted to reduce the position to the orbit, putting Mars at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 Virgo, with slightly less latitude than before, since the latitude was then decreasing. It was therefore about 4\u00b0 10\u2019, or 4\u00b0 7\u2153\u2019 if the parallax be neglected.\n But because, since Tycho\u2019s death, we have not made frequent observations nor continued them over several days, it would be best, for certainty\u2019s sake, also to make use of those observations which David Fabricius of East Frisia, a sedulous practitioner of astronomy, has communicated to me.\nOn February 16, old style, at 5h in the morning, he took the planet\u2019s distances from the tail of Leo (for the latitude), from the neck of Leo,30 and, on the other hand, from the bright star in the southern wing of Virgo, so as to check its longitude by working it out twice.\nI could make use of Tycho\u2019s line of reasoning, which he routinely adopted in volume I of the Progymnasmata when (as here) the declination of the planet was not known. But because that method extends to ten operations, I prefer for the sake of brevity to proceed as I did before with my own observations. Here there are no hidden dangers.\nFirst, the star in the wing of Virgo, adjusted to our time, is at 4\u00b0 36\u2019 30\u201c Libra with latitude 2\u00b0 50\u2019 north. Fabricius found that Mars is 20\u00b0 18\u2019 westward from it on the zodiac, which puts Mars at about 14\u00b0 18\u2019 30\u201c Virgo. This is a preliminary, approximate figure: the longitude will shortly be corrected. Now the tail of Leo31 is at 16\u00b0 4\u2019 Virgo, with latitude 12\u00b0 18\u2019 North, and Mars was found to be 8\u00b0 17\u2019 distant from the Tail. What is sought is the distance of its parallel from the Tail, since the difference in longitude is 1\u00b0 45\u2019. Dividing the secant of 8\u00b0 17\u2019 by the secant of 1\u00b0 45\u2019 gives the secant of 8\u00b0 6\u2019, the arc sought. This subtracted from the fixed star\u2019s northern latitude of 12\u00b0 18\u2019 leaves Mars\u2019s latitude, 4\u00b0 12\u2019 north. This I now take as determined, and compare it with the latitudes of the fixed stars according to the laws of trigonometry. From the Wing of Virgo, I find Mars\u2019s longitude to be 14\u00b0 19\u2019 Virgo; from the Neck of Leo, 14\u00b0 23\u2019 36\u201c. The mean of these two is 14\u00b0 21\u2019 18\u201c Virgo. And since the sextant gave distances larger than the truth, the latitude would come out at 4\u00b0 14\u2019 north.\nOn the night following February 23, at 12h, he observed Mars in relation to five fixed stars: the Tail of Leo and Arcturus for latitude, and for the longitude, in the first instance, Spica (which followed it), and, in the second, the Neck of Leo and Cor Leonis (which preceded it).\nBy a rough estimate, I foresee that Mars is going to fall at 11\u00bc\u00b0 Virgo. It was found to be 9\u00b0 24\u2019 from the Tail of Leo, and hence, its latitude comes out at 4\u00b0 6\u2019 ^32. And now, through this and the latitudes of the fixed stars, together with their distances (17\u00b0 26\u2019 from Regulus, 17\u00b0 51\u2019 from the Neck of Leo, 37\u00b0 28\u2019 from Spica, 44\u00b0 15\u2019 from Arcturus), Mars\u2019s position comes out at 11\u00b0 21\u2019 23\u201c Virgo (from Regulus), 11\u00b0 20\u2019 52\u201c Virgo (from the Neck of Leo), and 11\u00b0 17\u2019 40\u201c (from Spica). Again (as you see) the distances err in being too great. For from the Heart and the Neck [of Leo], Mars is pushed a little eastward, and from Spica and Arcturus a little westward, and more from Arcturus, owing to its greater northern latitude ^33. The mean (ignoring Arcturus), 11\u00b0 19\u2019 20\u201c Virgo, is very nearly true. Also, the latitude is greater, namely, 4\u00b0 7\u2019 40\u201c north. Now from February 15 at 17h to 23 February at 12h, a period of 7 days 19 hours, Mars moved 3\u00b0 0\u2019: 180 minutes in 187 hours. That is, about one minute per hour. And if you wish to take it into account, the parallax (if any) is subtracted from the longitude on February 16 and a little is added on February 23.\n Because the last observation follows the time of observation found by me by 2 days 21 hours 47 min., add the motion corresponding to this time, 1\u00b0 7\u2019: the position will come out 12\u00b0 26\u2019 Virgo. The agreement is thus very good\u2014it could not be better\u2014given that both of us [that is, Kepler and Fabricius] work independently and do not rely on the facilities used by Tycho Brahe.","1707":"VIII. On 1595 October 30 at 8h 20m, the planet was found at 17\u00b0 47\u2019 15\u201c Taurus,19 not far from the nonagesimal. We may thus be sure of the parallax, although we must take it into account. The latitude was 0\u00b0 5\u2019 10\u201c north. The sun\u2019s position was 16\u00b0 50\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio. The distance between the stars was 56\u2019 45\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 35\u201c; that of Mars, 22\u2019 54\u201c, as appears by comparing the nearby observations. The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 23\u2019 29\u201c. If the distance between the stars be divided by this, it comes out to 40\u2019 47\u201c of a day, or 16 hours 19 min. Therefore, the true opposition was 0h 39m PM on October 31. Mars\u2019s position was 17\u00b0 31\u2019 40\u201c Taurus. This needs no reduction to the orbit, as it is nearly at the node. The latitude was about 0\u00b0 8\u2019 north. But comparison with the preceding and following days shows a latitude of about 5\u2019 north.\nIX. Let, at any rate, Mars\u2019s position on 1597 December 10 at 8h 30m be 3\u00b0 45\u00bd\u2019 Cancer (as above) ^20. The sun\u2019s position was 29\u00b0 4\u2019 53\u201c Sagittarius. The distance between the stars was 4\u00b0 40\u2019 37\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 61\u2019 20\u201c, that of Mars 23\u2019 40\u201c (for in 1580 the diurnal motion in Gemini was 23\u2019, and in 1582, at 17\u00b0 Cancer, it was 24\u2019). Therefore, the sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 25\u2019 0\u201c. These data show that the time of true opposition followed 3 days 7 hours 14 min. later, on December 14 at 3h 44m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 2\u00b0 27\u2153\u2019 Cancer. The reduction to the orbit (quite ridiculous here, since the observation itself has an uncertainty of several minutes) requires the addition of about 52\u201c. Therefore, the corrected position was 2\u00b0 28\u2019 Cancer. The latitude, from the table, was 3\u00b0 33\u2019 north.\nOn the same night, the one following December 10, at 12\u2159h, Fabricius in East Frisia found Mars\u2019s position to be 3\u00b0 40\u00bc\u2019 Cancer with latitude 3\u00b0 23\u2019 N. In this observation the longitude comes out nearly the same. For the motion over 3h 40m is 3\u00bd\u2019, so that in the Brahean observation too, at 12\u2159h Mars could have been at 3\u00b0 42\u2019 Cancer\u2014two minutes beyond the Fabrician position.\nX. On 1600 January 13\/23 at 11h 40m, the time being adjusted to Uraniborg time, the planet was observed at 10\u00b0 38\u2019 46\u201c Leo ^21. The sun\u2019s position was 3\u00b0 26\u2019 30\u201c Aquarius. The stars were 7\u00b0 12\u2019 16\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion for the next few days was 1\u00b0 1\u2019 3\u201c; that of Mars, 23\u2019 44\u201c. The sum: 1\u00b0 24\u2019 47\u201c. The opposition therefore followed 5 days 2h 22m after; that is, on January 19\/29 at 2h 2m in the morning, before dawn. Mars was at 8\u00b0 38\u2019 Leo. There is no need for reduction, since it is near the limit. The latitude, from the table, was 4\u00b0 30\u2019 50\u201c N.\nXI. On the evening of 1602 Febr. 18\/28 at 10h 30m, using the Tychonic  instruments (with the help of the learned Matthias Seiffard,22 bequeathed us by Tycho), I took the distance of Mars from the middle star of the tail of Ursa Major 23 to be 52\u00b0 22\u2019. And since the distance between Cor Leonis and Procyon was 37\u00b0 22\u2019 20\u201c, which should have been 37\u00b0 19\u2019 50\u201c,24 we know that the sextant reads 2\u00bd minutes high. Therefore, the corrected distance of Mars from the tail of Ursa was 52\u00b0 19\u00bd\u2019. And since the latitude of the fixed star is 56\u00b0 22\u2019, the remainder, by subtraction, is 4\u00b0 2\u00bd\u2019\u2014supposing that Mars was at precisely the same longitude as the fixed star. But because there was a difference of 3\u00be degrees between them (as is clear from the following observations), a slight correction is required.\n For let AB be 3\u00b0 43\u2019 30\u201c on a parallel close to the ecliptic, B Mars, C the fixed star, and BC 52\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c. Dividing the secant of BC by the secant of AB gives the  secant of CA, 52\u00b0 14\u2019, which, subtracted from 56\u00b0 22\u2019 (the latitude of the fixed star) leaves 4\u00b0 8\u2019 north as Mars\u2019s observed latitude. At the same time, we found 19\u00b0 23\u2019 between Mars and Cor Leonis (19\u00b0 20\u00bd corrected), and 21\u00b0 20\u2019 between Mars and the bright star in the wing of Virgo25 (21\u00b0 17\u00bd\u2019 corrected). From these two distances (using the latitudes of the stars and Mars), Mars\u2019s longitude is found to be 13\u00b0 19\u2019 6\u201c Virgo, by consensus of all measurements.\nAlternatively, the meridian altitude of Mars was found at 12h 40m, using two quadrants, to be 50\u00b0 19\u2019, while the tail of Leo26 was 56\u00b0 45\u2019. Therefore, from the declinations and right ascensions of the fixed stars and our distances, Mars\u2019s position is determined as 13\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c Virgo, latitude 4\u00b0 7\u2019 55\u201c ^27. This is the Tychonic procedure. I have included the other for the sake of showing a consensus, and also that it might be evident that despite the lack of absolute perfection in the demonstration, short cuts either in computation or in our understanding can under certain circumstances be applied. For in that previous procedure there is less in the actual work than in the reporting of it. At Prague, 5\u00b0 Scorpio was rising ^28. Therefore, the nonagesimal was about 32\u00bd\u00b0 from the zenith. And since Mars\u2019s distance from the earth was rather more than half the sun\u2019s distance, the resulting parallax of about 5\u2019 opposite 32\u00bd\u00b0 in our parallactic table, shows a latitudinal parallax of 2\u2019 41\u201c. Thus the latitude as seen from the middle of the earth would be 4\u00b0 10\u2154\u2019 north. And because the altitude of the nonagesimal was 57\u00bd\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax at the horizon was 4\u2019 13\u201c. But since Mars was 38\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, the longitudinal parallax corresponding to this position is 2\u2019 36\u201c, and if this be eliminated, Mars would be placed at about 13\u00b0 18\u2019 Virgo ^29. At that moment, the sun\u2019s position was 10\u00b0 16\u2019 42\u201c Pisces. The distance between the bodies was 3\u00b0 1\u2019 18\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 4\u201c, and that of Mars, 24\u2019 5\u201c (for it was 24\u2019 18\u201c at 21\u00b0 Leo in 1585, and 24\u2019 at 26 Virgo in 1587). The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 24\u2019 9\u201c. The true opposition therefore followed 2 days 3 hours 43 minutes later, on 21 February\/3 March before dawn at 2h 13m, Mars being at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 35\u201c Virgo. Forty seconds must be subtracted to reduce the position to the orbit, putting Mars at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 Virgo, with slightly less latitude than before, since the latitude was then decreasing. It was therefore about 4\u00b0 10\u2019, or 4\u00b0 7\u2153\u2019 if the parallax be neglected.\n But because, since Tycho\u2019s death, we have not made frequent observations nor continued them over several days, it would be best, for certainty\u2019s sake, also to make use of those observations which David Fabricius of East Frisia, a sedulous practitioner of astronomy, has communicated to me.\nOn February 16, old style, at 5h in the morning, he took the planet\u2019s distances from the tail of Leo (for the latitude), from the neck of Leo,30 and, on the other hand, from the bright star in the southern wing of Virgo, so as to check its longitude by working it out twice.\nI could make use of Tycho\u2019s line of reasoning, which he routinely adopted in volume I of the Progymnasmata when (as here) the declination of the planet was not known. But because that method extends to ten operations, I prefer for the sake of brevity to proceed as I did before with my own observations. Here there are no hidden dangers.\nFirst, the star in the wing of Virgo, adjusted to our time, is at 4\u00b0 36\u2019 30\u201c Libra with latitude 2\u00b0 50\u2019 north. Fabricius found that Mars is 20\u00b0 18\u2019 westward from it on the zodiac, which puts Mars at about 14\u00b0 18\u2019 30\u201c Virgo. This is a preliminary, approximate figure: the longitude will shortly be corrected. Now the tail of Leo31 is at 16\u00b0 4\u2019 Virgo, with latitude 12\u00b0 18\u2019 North, and Mars was found to be 8\u00b0 17\u2019 distant from the Tail. What is sought is the distance of its parallel from the Tail, since the difference in longitude is 1\u00b0 45\u2019. Dividing the secant of 8\u00b0 17\u2019 by the secant of 1\u00b0 45\u2019 gives the secant of 8\u00b0 6\u2019, the arc sought. This subtracted from the fixed star\u2019s northern latitude of 12\u00b0 18\u2019 leaves Mars\u2019s latitude, 4\u00b0 12\u2019 north. This I now take as determined, and compare it with the latitudes of the fixed stars according to the laws of trigonometry. From the Wing of Virgo, I find Mars\u2019s longitude to be 14\u00b0 19\u2019 Virgo; from the Neck of Leo, 14\u00b0 23\u2019 36\u201c. The mean of these two is 14\u00b0 21\u2019 18\u201c Virgo. And since the sextant gave distances larger than the truth, the latitude would come out at 4\u00b0 14\u2019 north.\nOn the night following February 23, at 12h, he observed Mars in relation to five fixed stars: the Tail of Leo and Arcturus for latitude, and for the longitude, in the first instance, Spica (which followed it), and, in the second, the Neck of Leo and Cor Leonis (which preceded it).\nBy a rough estimate, I foresee that Mars is going to fall at 11\u00bc\u00b0 Virgo. It was found to be 9\u00b0 24\u2019 from the Tail of Leo, and hence, its latitude comes out at 4\u00b0 6\u2019 ^32. And now, through this and the latitudes of the fixed stars, together with their distances (17\u00b0 26\u2019 from Regulus, 17\u00b0 51\u2019 from the Neck of Leo, 37\u00b0 28\u2019 from Spica, 44\u00b0 15\u2019 from Arcturus), Mars\u2019s position comes out at 11\u00b0 21\u2019 23\u201c Virgo (from Regulus), 11\u00b0 20\u2019 52\u201c Virgo (from the Neck of Leo), and 11\u00b0 17\u2019 40\u201c (from Spica). Again (as you see) the distances err in being too great. For from the Heart and the Neck [of Leo], Mars is pushed a little eastward, and from Spica and Arcturus a little westward, and more from Arcturus, owing to its greater northern latitude ^33. The mean (ignoring Arcturus), 11\u00b0 19\u2019 20\u201c Virgo, is very nearly true. Also, the latitude is greater, namely, 4\u00b0 7\u2019 40\u201c north. Now from February 15 at 17h to 23 February at 12h, a period of 7 days 19 hours, Mars moved 3\u00b0 0\u2019: 180 minutes in 187 hours. That is, about one minute per hour. And if you wish to take it into account, the parallax (if any) is subtracted from the longitude on February 16 and a little is added on February 23.\n Because the last observation follows the time of observation found by me by 2 days 21 hours 47 min., add the motion corresponding to this time, 1\u00b0 7\u2019: the position will come out 12\u00b0 26\u2019 Virgo. The agreement is thus very good\u2014it could not be better\u2014given that both of us [that is, Kepler and Fabricius] work independently and do not rely on the facilities used by Tycho Brahe.","1708":"VIII. On 1595 October 30 at 8h 20m, the planet was found at 17\u00b0 47\u2019 15\u201c Taurus,19 not far from the nonagesimal. We may thus be sure of the parallax, although we must take it into account. The latitude was 0\u00b0 5\u2019 10\u201c north. The sun\u2019s position was 16\u00b0 50\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio. The distance between the stars was 56\u2019 45\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 35\u201c; that of Mars, 22\u2019 54\u201c, as appears by comparing the nearby observations. The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 23\u2019 29\u201c. If the distance between the stars be divided by this, it comes out to 40\u2019 47\u201c of a day, or 16 hours 19 min. Therefore, the true opposition was 0h 39m PM on October 31. Mars\u2019s position was 17\u00b0 31\u2019 40\u201c Taurus. This needs no reduction to the orbit, as it is nearly at the node. The latitude was about 0\u00b0 8\u2019 north. But comparison with the preceding and following days shows a latitude of about 5\u2019 north.\nIX. Let, at any rate, Mars\u2019s position on 1597 December 10 at 8h 30m be 3\u00b0 45\u00bd\u2019 Cancer (as above) ^20. The sun\u2019s position was 29\u00b0 4\u2019 53\u201c Sagittarius. The distance between the stars was 4\u00b0 40\u2019 37\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 61\u2019 20\u201c, that of Mars 23\u2019 40\u201c (for in 1580 the diurnal motion in Gemini was 23\u2019, and in 1582, at 17\u00b0 Cancer, it was 24\u2019). Therefore, the sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 25\u2019 0\u201c. These data show that the time of true opposition followed 3 days 7 hours 14 min. later, on December 14 at 3h 44m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 2\u00b0 27\u2153\u2019 Cancer. The reduction to the orbit (quite ridiculous here, since the observation itself has an uncertainty of several minutes) requires the addition of about 52\u201c. Therefore, the corrected position was 2\u00b0 28\u2019 Cancer. The latitude, from the table, was 3\u00b0 33\u2019 north.\nOn the same night, the one following December 10, at 12\u2159h, Fabricius in East Frisia found Mars\u2019s position to be 3\u00b0 40\u00bc\u2019 Cancer with latitude 3\u00b0 23\u2019 N. In this observation the longitude comes out nearly the same. For the motion over 3h 40m is 3\u00bd\u2019, so that in the Brahean observation too, at 12\u2159h Mars could have been at 3\u00b0 42\u2019 Cancer\u2014two minutes beyond the Fabrician position.\nX. On 1600 January 13\/23 at 11h 40m, the time being adjusted to Uraniborg time, the planet was observed at 10\u00b0 38\u2019 46\u201c Leo ^21. The sun\u2019s position was 3\u00b0 26\u2019 30\u201c Aquarius. The stars were 7\u00b0 12\u2019 16\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion for the next few days was 1\u00b0 1\u2019 3\u201c; that of Mars, 23\u2019 44\u201c. The sum: 1\u00b0 24\u2019 47\u201c. The opposition therefore followed 5 days 2h 22m after; that is, on January 19\/29 at 2h 2m in the morning, before dawn. Mars was at 8\u00b0 38\u2019 Leo. There is no need for reduction, since it is near the limit. The latitude, from the table, was 4\u00b0 30\u2019 50\u201c N.\nXI. On the evening of 1602 Febr. 18\/28 at 10h 30m, using the Tychonic  instruments (with the help of the learned Matthias Seiffard,22 bequeathed us by Tycho), I took the distance of Mars from the middle star of the tail of Ursa Major 23 to be 52\u00b0 22\u2019. And since the distance between Cor Leonis and Procyon was 37\u00b0 22\u2019 20\u201c, which should have been 37\u00b0 19\u2019 50\u201c,24 we know that the sextant reads 2\u00bd minutes high. Therefore, the corrected distance of Mars from the tail of Ursa was 52\u00b0 19\u00bd\u2019. And since the latitude of the fixed star is 56\u00b0 22\u2019, the remainder, by subtraction, is 4\u00b0 2\u00bd\u2019\u2014supposing that Mars was at precisely the same longitude as the fixed star. But because there was a difference of 3\u00be degrees between them (as is clear from the following observations), a slight correction is required.\n For let AB be 3\u00b0 43\u2019 30\u201c on a parallel close to the ecliptic, B Mars, C the fixed star, and BC 52\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c. Dividing the secant of BC by the secant of AB gives the  secant of CA, 52\u00b0 14\u2019, which, subtracted from 56\u00b0 22\u2019 (the latitude of the fixed star) leaves 4\u00b0 8\u2019 north as Mars\u2019s observed latitude. At the same time, we found 19\u00b0 23\u2019 between Mars and Cor Leonis (19\u00b0 20\u00bd corrected), and 21\u00b0 20\u2019 between Mars and the bright star in the wing of Virgo25 (21\u00b0 17\u00bd\u2019 corrected). From these two distances (using the latitudes of the stars and Mars), Mars\u2019s longitude is found to be 13\u00b0 19\u2019 6\u201c Virgo, by consensus of all measurements.\nAlternatively, the meridian altitude of Mars was found at 12h 40m, using two quadrants, to be 50\u00b0 19\u2019, while the tail of Leo26 was 56\u00b0 45\u2019. Therefore, from the declinations and right ascensions of the fixed stars and our distances, Mars\u2019s position is determined as 13\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c Virgo, latitude 4\u00b0 7\u2019 55\u201c ^27. This is the Tychonic procedure. I have included the other for the sake of showing a consensus, and also that it might be evident that despite the lack of absolute perfection in the demonstration, short cuts either in computation or in our understanding can under certain circumstances be applied. For in that previous procedure there is less in the actual work than in the reporting of it. At Prague, 5\u00b0 Scorpio was rising ^28. Therefore, the nonagesimal was about 32\u00bd\u00b0 from the zenith. And since Mars\u2019s distance from the earth was rather more than half the sun\u2019s distance, the resulting parallax of about 5\u2019 opposite 32\u00bd\u00b0 in our parallactic table, shows a latitudinal parallax of 2\u2019 41\u201c. Thus the latitude as seen from the middle of the earth would be 4\u00b0 10\u2154\u2019 north. And because the altitude of the nonagesimal was 57\u00bd\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax at the horizon was 4\u2019 13\u201c. But since Mars was 38\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, the longitudinal parallax corresponding to this position is 2\u2019 36\u201c, and if this be eliminated, Mars would be placed at about 13\u00b0 18\u2019 Virgo ^29. At that moment, the sun\u2019s position was 10\u00b0 16\u2019 42\u201c Pisces. The distance between the bodies was 3\u00b0 1\u2019 18\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 4\u201c, and that of Mars, 24\u2019 5\u201c (for it was 24\u2019 18\u201c at 21\u00b0 Leo in 1585, and 24\u2019 at 26 Virgo in 1587). The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 24\u2019 9\u201c. The true opposition therefore followed 2 days 3 hours 43 minutes later, on 21 February\/3 March before dawn at 2h 13m, Mars being at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 35\u201c Virgo. Forty seconds must be subtracted to reduce the position to the orbit, putting Mars at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 Virgo, with slightly less latitude than before, since the latitude was then decreasing. It was therefore about 4\u00b0 10\u2019, or 4\u00b0 7\u2153\u2019 if the parallax be neglected.\n But because, since Tycho\u2019s death, we have not made frequent observations nor continued them over several days, it would be best, for certainty\u2019s sake, also to make use of those observations which David Fabricius of East Frisia, a sedulous practitioner of astronomy, has communicated to me.\nOn February 16, old style, at 5h in the morning, he took the planet\u2019s distances from the tail of Leo (for the latitude), from the neck of Leo,30 and, on the other hand, from the bright star in the southern wing of Virgo, so as to check its longitude by working it out twice.\nI could make use of Tycho\u2019s line of reasoning, which he routinely adopted in volume I of the Progymnasmata when (as here) the declination of the planet was not known. But because that method extends to ten operations, I prefer for the sake of brevity to proceed as I did before with my own observations. Here there are no hidden dangers.\nFirst, the star in the wing of Virgo, adjusted to our time, is at 4\u00b0 36\u2019 30\u201c Libra with latitude 2\u00b0 50\u2019 north. Fabricius found that Mars is 20\u00b0 18\u2019 westward from it on the zodiac, which puts Mars at about 14\u00b0 18\u2019 30\u201c Virgo. This is a preliminary, approximate figure: the longitude will shortly be corrected. Now the tail of Leo31 is at 16\u00b0 4\u2019 Virgo, with latitude 12\u00b0 18\u2019 North, and Mars was found to be 8\u00b0 17\u2019 distant from the Tail. What is sought is the distance of its parallel from the Tail, since the difference in longitude is 1\u00b0 45\u2019. Dividing the secant of 8\u00b0 17\u2019 by the secant of 1\u00b0 45\u2019 gives the secant of 8\u00b0 6\u2019, the arc sought. This subtracted from the fixed star\u2019s northern latitude of 12\u00b0 18\u2019 leaves Mars\u2019s latitude, 4\u00b0 12\u2019 north. This I now take as determined, and compare it with the latitudes of the fixed stars according to the laws of trigonometry. From the Wing of Virgo, I find Mars\u2019s longitude to be 14\u00b0 19\u2019 Virgo; from the Neck of Leo, 14\u00b0 23\u2019 36\u201c. The mean of these two is 14\u00b0 21\u2019 18\u201c Virgo. And since the sextant gave distances larger than the truth, the latitude would come out at 4\u00b0 14\u2019 north.\nOn the night following February 23, at 12h, he observed Mars in relation to five fixed stars: the Tail of Leo and Arcturus for latitude, and for the longitude, in the first instance, Spica (which followed it), and, in the second, the Neck of Leo and Cor Leonis (which preceded it).\nBy a rough estimate, I foresee that Mars is going to fall at 11\u00bc\u00b0 Virgo. It was found to be 9\u00b0 24\u2019 from the Tail of Leo, and hence, its latitude comes out at 4\u00b0 6\u2019 ^32. And now, through this and the latitudes of the fixed stars, together with their distances (17\u00b0 26\u2019 from Regulus, 17\u00b0 51\u2019 from the Neck of Leo, 37\u00b0 28\u2019 from Spica, 44\u00b0 15\u2019 from Arcturus), Mars\u2019s position comes out at 11\u00b0 21\u2019 23\u201c Virgo (from Regulus), 11\u00b0 20\u2019 52\u201c Virgo (from the Neck of Leo), and 11\u00b0 17\u2019 40\u201c (from Spica). Again (as you see) the distances err in being too great. For from the Heart and the Neck [of Leo], Mars is pushed a little eastward, and from Spica and Arcturus a little westward, and more from Arcturus, owing to its greater northern latitude ^33. The mean (ignoring Arcturus), 11\u00b0 19\u2019 20\u201c Virgo, is very nearly true. Also, the latitude is greater, namely, 4\u00b0 7\u2019 40\u201c north. Now from February 15 at 17h to 23 February at 12h, a period of 7 days 19 hours, Mars moved 3\u00b0 0\u2019: 180 minutes in 187 hours. That is, about one minute per hour. And if you wish to take it into account, the parallax (if any) is subtracted from the longitude on February 16 and a little is added on February 23.\n Because the last observation follows the time of observation found by me by 2 days 21 hours 47 min., add the motion corresponding to this time, 1\u00b0 7\u2019: the position will come out 12\u00b0 26\u2019 Virgo. The agreement is thus very good\u2014it could not be better\u2014given that both of us [that is, Kepler and Fabricius] work independently and do not rely on the facilities used by Tycho Brahe.","1709":"VIII. On 1595 October 30 at 8h 20m, the planet was found at 17\u00b0 47\u2019 15\u201c Taurus,19 not far from the nonagesimal. We may thus be sure of the parallax, although we must take it into account. The latitude was 0\u00b0 5\u2019 10\u201c north. The sun\u2019s position was 16\u00b0 50\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio. The distance between the stars was 56\u2019 45\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 35\u201c; that of Mars, 22\u2019 54\u201c, as appears by comparing the nearby observations. The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 23\u2019 29\u201c. If the distance between the stars be divided by this, it comes out to 40\u2019 47\u201c of a day, or 16 hours 19 min. Therefore, the true opposition was 0h 39m PM on October 31. Mars\u2019s position was 17\u00b0 31\u2019 40\u201c Taurus. This needs no reduction to the orbit, as it is nearly at the node. The latitude was about 0\u00b0 8\u2019 north. But comparison with the preceding and following days shows a latitude of about 5\u2019 north.\nIX. Let, at any rate, Mars\u2019s position on 1597 December 10 at 8h 30m be 3\u00b0 45\u00bd\u2019 Cancer (as above) ^20. The sun\u2019s position was 29\u00b0 4\u2019 53\u201c Sagittarius. The distance between the stars was 4\u00b0 40\u2019 37\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 61\u2019 20\u201c, that of Mars 23\u2019 40\u201c (for in 1580 the diurnal motion in Gemini was 23\u2019, and in 1582, at 17\u00b0 Cancer, it was 24\u2019). Therefore, the sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 25\u2019 0\u201c. These data show that the time of true opposition followed 3 days 7 hours 14 min. later, on December 14 at 3h 44m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 2\u00b0 27\u2153\u2019 Cancer. The reduction to the orbit (quite ridiculous here, since the observation itself has an uncertainty of several minutes) requires the addition of about 52\u201c. Therefore, the corrected position was 2\u00b0 28\u2019 Cancer. The latitude, from the table, was 3\u00b0 33\u2019 north.\nOn the same night, the one following December 10, at 12\u2159h, Fabricius in East Frisia found Mars\u2019s position to be 3\u00b0 40\u00bc\u2019 Cancer with latitude 3\u00b0 23\u2019 N. In this observation the longitude comes out nearly the same. For the motion over 3h 40m is 3\u00bd\u2019, so that in the Brahean observation too, at 12\u2159h Mars could have been at 3\u00b0 42\u2019 Cancer\u2014two minutes beyond the Fabrician position.\nX. On 1600 January 13\/23 at 11h 40m, the time being adjusted to Uraniborg time, the planet was observed at 10\u00b0 38\u2019 46\u201c Leo ^21. The sun\u2019s position was 3\u00b0 26\u2019 30\u201c Aquarius. The stars were 7\u00b0 12\u2019 16\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion for the next few days was 1\u00b0 1\u2019 3\u201c; that of Mars, 23\u2019 44\u201c. The sum: 1\u00b0 24\u2019 47\u201c. The opposition therefore followed 5 days 2h 22m after; that is, on January 19\/29 at 2h 2m in the morning, before dawn. Mars was at 8\u00b0 38\u2019 Leo. There is no need for reduction, since it is near the limit. The latitude, from the table, was 4\u00b0 30\u2019 50\u201c N.\nXI. On the evening of 1602 Febr. 18\/28 at 10h 30m, using the Tychonic  instruments (with the help of the learned Matthias Seiffard,22 bequeathed us by Tycho), I took the distance of Mars from the middle star of the tail of Ursa Major 23 to be 52\u00b0 22\u2019. And since the distance between Cor Leonis and Procyon was 37\u00b0 22\u2019 20\u201c, which should have been 37\u00b0 19\u2019 50\u201c,24 we know that the sextant reads 2\u00bd minutes high. Therefore, the corrected distance of Mars from the tail of Ursa was 52\u00b0 19\u00bd\u2019. And since the latitude of the fixed star is 56\u00b0 22\u2019, the remainder, by subtraction, is 4\u00b0 2\u00bd\u2019\u2014supposing that Mars was at precisely the same longitude as the fixed star. But because there was a difference of 3\u00be degrees between them (as is clear from the following observations), a slight correction is required.\n For let AB be 3\u00b0 43\u2019 30\u201c on a parallel close to the ecliptic, B Mars, C the fixed star, and BC 52\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c. Dividing the secant of BC by the secant of AB gives the  secant of CA, 52\u00b0 14\u2019, which, subtracted from 56\u00b0 22\u2019 (the latitude of the fixed star) leaves 4\u00b0 8\u2019 north as Mars\u2019s observed latitude. At the same time, we found 19\u00b0 23\u2019 between Mars and Cor Leonis (19\u00b0 20\u00bd corrected), and 21\u00b0 20\u2019 between Mars and the bright star in the wing of Virgo25 (21\u00b0 17\u00bd\u2019 corrected). From these two distances (using the latitudes of the stars and Mars), Mars\u2019s longitude is found to be 13\u00b0 19\u2019 6\u201c Virgo, by consensus of all measurements.\nAlternatively, the meridian altitude of Mars was found at 12h 40m, using two quadrants, to be 50\u00b0 19\u2019, while the tail of Leo26 was 56\u00b0 45\u2019. Therefore, from the declinations and right ascensions of the fixed stars and our distances, Mars\u2019s position is determined as 13\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c Virgo, latitude 4\u00b0 7\u2019 55\u201c ^27. This is the Tychonic procedure. I have included the other for the sake of showing a consensus, and also that it might be evident that despite the lack of absolute perfection in the demonstration, short cuts either in computation or in our understanding can under certain circumstances be applied. For in that previous procedure there is less in the actual work than in the reporting of it. At Prague, 5\u00b0 Scorpio was rising ^28. Therefore, the nonagesimal was about 32\u00bd\u00b0 from the zenith. And since Mars\u2019s distance from the earth was rather more than half the sun\u2019s distance, the resulting parallax of about 5\u2019 opposite 32\u00bd\u00b0 in our parallactic table, shows a latitudinal parallax of 2\u2019 41\u201c. Thus the latitude as seen from the middle of the earth would be 4\u00b0 10\u2154\u2019 north. And because the altitude of the nonagesimal was 57\u00bd\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax at the horizon was 4\u2019 13\u201c. But since Mars was 38\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, the longitudinal parallax corresponding to this position is 2\u2019 36\u201c, and if this be eliminated, Mars would be placed at about 13\u00b0 18\u2019 Virgo ^29. At that moment, the sun\u2019s position was 10\u00b0 16\u2019 42\u201c Pisces. The distance between the bodies was 3\u00b0 1\u2019 18\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 4\u201c, and that of Mars, 24\u2019 5\u201c (for it was 24\u2019 18\u201c at 21\u00b0 Leo in 1585, and 24\u2019 at 26 Virgo in 1587). The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 24\u2019 9\u201c. The true opposition therefore followed 2 days 3 hours 43 minutes later, on 21 February\/3 March before dawn at 2h 13m, Mars being at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 35\u201c Virgo. Forty seconds must be subtracted to reduce the position to the orbit, putting Mars at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 Virgo, with slightly less latitude than before, since the latitude was then decreasing. It was therefore about 4\u00b0 10\u2019, or 4\u00b0 7\u2153\u2019 if the parallax be neglected.\n But because, since Tycho\u2019s death, we have not made frequent observations nor continued them over several days, it would be best, for certainty\u2019s sake, also to make use of those observations which David Fabricius of East Frisia, a sedulous practitioner of astronomy, has communicated to me.\nOn February 16, old style, at 5h in the morning, he took the planet\u2019s distances from the tail of Leo (for the latitude), from the neck of Leo,30 and, on the other hand, from the bright star in the southern wing of Virgo, so as to check its longitude by working it out twice.\nI could make use of Tycho\u2019s line of reasoning, which he routinely adopted in volume I of the Progymnasmata when (as here) the declination of the planet was not known. But because that method extends to ten operations, I prefer for the sake of brevity to proceed as I did before with my own observations. Here there are no hidden dangers.\nFirst, the star in the wing of Virgo, adjusted to our time, is at 4\u00b0 36\u2019 30\u201c Libra with latitude 2\u00b0 50\u2019 north. Fabricius found that Mars is 20\u00b0 18\u2019 westward from it on the zodiac, which puts Mars at about 14\u00b0 18\u2019 30\u201c Virgo. This is a preliminary, approximate figure: the longitude will shortly be corrected. Now the tail of Leo31 is at 16\u00b0 4\u2019 Virgo, with latitude 12\u00b0 18\u2019 North, and Mars was found to be 8\u00b0 17\u2019 distant from the Tail. What is sought is the distance of its parallel from the Tail, since the difference in longitude is 1\u00b0 45\u2019. Dividing the secant of 8\u00b0 17\u2019 by the secant of 1\u00b0 45\u2019 gives the secant of 8\u00b0 6\u2019, the arc sought. This subtracted from the fixed star\u2019s northern latitude of 12\u00b0 18\u2019 leaves Mars\u2019s latitude, 4\u00b0 12\u2019 north. This I now take as determined, and compare it with the latitudes of the fixed stars according to the laws of trigonometry. From the Wing of Virgo, I find Mars\u2019s longitude to be 14\u00b0 19\u2019 Virgo; from the Neck of Leo, 14\u00b0 23\u2019 36\u201c. The mean of these two is 14\u00b0 21\u2019 18\u201c Virgo. And since the sextant gave distances larger than the truth, the latitude would come out at 4\u00b0 14\u2019 north.\nOn the night following February 23, at 12h, he observed Mars in relation to five fixed stars: the Tail of Leo and Arcturus for latitude, and for the longitude, in the first instance, Spica (which followed it), and, in the second, the Neck of Leo and Cor Leonis (which preceded it).\nBy a rough estimate, I foresee that Mars is going to fall at 11\u00bc\u00b0 Virgo. It was found to be 9\u00b0 24\u2019 from the Tail of Leo, and hence, its latitude comes out at 4\u00b0 6\u2019 ^32. And now, through this and the latitudes of the fixed stars, together with their distances (17\u00b0 26\u2019 from Regulus, 17\u00b0 51\u2019 from the Neck of Leo, 37\u00b0 28\u2019 from Spica, 44\u00b0 15\u2019 from Arcturus), Mars\u2019s position comes out at 11\u00b0 21\u2019 23\u201c Virgo (from Regulus), 11\u00b0 20\u2019 52\u201c Virgo (from the Neck of Leo), and 11\u00b0 17\u2019 40\u201c (from Spica). Again (as you see) the distances err in being too great. For from the Heart and the Neck [of Leo], Mars is pushed a little eastward, and from Spica and Arcturus a little westward, and more from Arcturus, owing to its greater northern latitude ^33. The mean (ignoring Arcturus), 11\u00b0 19\u2019 20\u201c Virgo, is very nearly true. Also, the latitude is greater, namely, 4\u00b0 7\u2019 40\u201c north. Now from February 15 at 17h to 23 February at 12h, a period of 7 days 19 hours, Mars moved 3\u00b0 0\u2019: 180 minutes in 187 hours. That is, about one minute per hour. And if you wish to take it into account, the parallax (if any) is subtracted from the longitude on February 16 and a little is added on February 23.\n Because the last observation follows the time of observation found by me by 2 days 21 hours 47 min., add the motion corresponding to this time, 1\u00b0 7\u2019: the position will come out 12\u00b0 26\u2019 Virgo. The agreement is thus very good\u2014it could not be better\u2014given that both of us [that is, Kepler and Fabricius] work independently and do not rely on the facilities used by Tycho Brahe.","1710":"VIII. On 1595 October 30 at 8h 20m, the planet was found at 17\u00b0 47\u2019 15\u201c Taurus,19 not far from the nonagesimal. We may thus be sure of the parallax, although we must take it into account. The latitude was 0\u00b0 5\u2019 10\u201c north. The sun\u2019s position was 16\u00b0 50\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio. The distance between the stars was 56\u2019 45\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 35\u201c; that of Mars, 22\u2019 54\u201c, as appears by comparing the nearby observations. The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 23\u2019 29\u201c. If the distance between the stars be divided by this, it comes out to 40\u2019 47\u201c of a day, or 16 hours 19 min. Therefore, the true opposition was 0h 39m PM on October 31. Mars\u2019s position was 17\u00b0 31\u2019 40\u201c Taurus. This needs no reduction to the orbit, as it is nearly at the node. The latitude was about 0\u00b0 8\u2019 north. But comparison with the preceding and following days shows a latitude of about 5\u2019 north.\nIX. Let, at any rate, Mars\u2019s position on 1597 December 10 at 8h 30m be 3\u00b0 45\u00bd\u2019 Cancer (as above) ^20. The sun\u2019s position was 29\u00b0 4\u2019 53\u201c Sagittarius. The distance between the stars was 4\u00b0 40\u2019 37\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 61\u2019 20\u201c, that of Mars 23\u2019 40\u201c (for in 1580 the diurnal motion in Gemini was 23\u2019, and in 1582, at 17\u00b0 Cancer, it was 24\u2019). Therefore, the sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 25\u2019 0\u201c. These data show that the time of true opposition followed 3 days 7 hours 14 min. later, on December 14 at 3h 44m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 2\u00b0 27\u2153\u2019 Cancer. The reduction to the orbit (quite ridiculous here, since the observation itself has an uncertainty of several minutes) requires the addition of about 52\u201c. Therefore, the corrected position was 2\u00b0 28\u2019 Cancer. The latitude, from the table, was 3\u00b0 33\u2019 north.\nOn the same night, the one following December 10, at 12\u2159h, Fabricius in East Frisia found Mars\u2019s position to be 3\u00b0 40\u00bc\u2019 Cancer with latitude 3\u00b0 23\u2019 N. In this observation the longitude comes out nearly the same. For the motion over 3h 40m is 3\u00bd\u2019, so that in the Brahean observation too, at 12\u2159h Mars could have been at 3\u00b0 42\u2019 Cancer\u2014two minutes beyond the Fabrician position.\nX. On 1600 January 13\/23 at 11h 40m, the time being adjusted to Uraniborg time, the planet was observed at 10\u00b0 38\u2019 46\u201c Leo ^21. The sun\u2019s position was 3\u00b0 26\u2019 30\u201c Aquarius. The stars were 7\u00b0 12\u2019 16\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion for the next few days was 1\u00b0 1\u2019 3\u201c; that of Mars, 23\u2019 44\u201c. The sum: 1\u00b0 24\u2019 47\u201c. The opposition therefore followed 5 days 2h 22m after; that is, on January 19\/29 at 2h 2m in the morning, before dawn. Mars was at 8\u00b0 38\u2019 Leo. There is no need for reduction, since it is near the limit. The latitude, from the table, was 4\u00b0 30\u2019 50\u201c N.\nXI. On the evening of 1602 Febr. 18\/28 at 10h 30m, using the Tychonic  instruments (with the help of the learned Matthias Seiffard,22 bequeathed us by Tycho), I took the distance of Mars from the middle star of the tail of Ursa Major 23 to be 52\u00b0 22\u2019. And since the distance between Cor Leonis and Procyon was 37\u00b0 22\u2019 20\u201c, which should have been 37\u00b0 19\u2019 50\u201c,24 we know that the sextant reads 2\u00bd minutes high. Therefore, the corrected distance of Mars from the tail of Ursa was 52\u00b0 19\u00bd\u2019. And since the latitude of the fixed star is 56\u00b0 22\u2019, the remainder, by subtraction, is 4\u00b0 2\u00bd\u2019\u2014supposing that Mars was at precisely the same longitude as the fixed star. But because there was a difference of 3\u00be degrees between them (as is clear from the following observations), a slight correction is required.\n For let AB be 3\u00b0 43\u2019 30\u201c on a parallel close to the ecliptic, B Mars, C the fixed star, and BC 52\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c. Dividing the secant of BC by the secant of AB gives the  secant of CA, 52\u00b0 14\u2019, which, subtracted from 56\u00b0 22\u2019 (the latitude of the fixed star) leaves 4\u00b0 8\u2019 north as Mars\u2019s observed latitude. At the same time, we found 19\u00b0 23\u2019 between Mars and Cor Leonis (19\u00b0 20\u00bd corrected), and 21\u00b0 20\u2019 between Mars and the bright star in the wing of Virgo25 (21\u00b0 17\u00bd\u2019 corrected). From these two distances (using the latitudes of the stars and Mars), Mars\u2019s longitude is found to be 13\u00b0 19\u2019 6\u201c Virgo, by consensus of all measurements.\nAlternatively, the meridian altitude of Mars was found at 12h 40m, using two quadrants, to be 50\u00b0 19\u2019, while the tail of Leo26 was 56\u00b0 45\u2019. Therefore, from the declinations and right ascensions of the fixed stars and our distances, Mars\u2019s position is determined as 13\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c Virgo, latitude 4\u00b0 7\u2019 55\u201c ^27. This is the Tychonic procedure. I have included the other for the sake of showing a consensus, and also that it might be evident that despite the lack of absolute perfection in the demonstration, short cuts either in computation or in our understanding can under certain circumstances be applied. For in that previous procedure there is less in the actual work than in the reporting of it. At Prague, 5\u00b0 Scorpio was rising ^28. Therefore, the nonagesimal was about 32\u00bd\u00b0 from the zenith. And since Mars\u2019s distance from the earth was rather more than half the sun\u2019s distance, the resulting parallax of about 5\u2019 opposite 32\u00bd\u00b0 in our parallactic table, shows a latitudinal parallax of 2\u2019 41\u201c. Thus the latitude as seen from the middle of the earth would be 4\u00b0 10\u2154\u2019 north. And because the altitude of the nonagesimal was 57\u00bd\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax at the horizon was 4\u2019 13\u201c. But since Mars was 38\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, the longitudinal parallax corresponding to this position is 2\u2019 36\u201c, and if this be eliminated, Mars would be placed at about 13\u00b0 18\u2019 Virgo ^29. At that moment, the sun\u2019s position was 10\u00b0 16\u2019 42\u201c Pisces. The distance between the bodies was 3\u00b0 1\u2019 18\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 4\u201c, and that of Mars, 24\u2019 5\u201c (for it was 24\u2019 18\u201c at 21\u00b0 Leo in 1585, and 24\u2019 at 26 Virgo in 1587). The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 24\u2019 9\u201c. The true opposition therefore followed 2 days 3 hours 43 minutes later, on 21 February\/3 March before dawn at 2h 13m, Mars being at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 35\u201c Virgo. Forty seconds must be subtracted to reduce the position to the orbit, putting Mars at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 Virgo, with slightly less latitude than before, since the latitude was then decreasing. It was therefore about 4\u00b0 10\u2019, or 4\u00b0 7\u2153\u2019 if the parallax be neglected.\n But because, since Tycho\u2019s death, we have not made frequent observations nor continued them over several days, it would be best, for certainty\u2019s sake, also to make use of those observations which David Fabricius of East Frisia, a sedulous practitioner of astronomy, has communicated to me.\nOn February 16, old style, at 5h in the morning, he took the planet\u2019s distances from the tail of Leo (for the latitude), from the neck of Leo,30 and, on the other hand, from the bright star in the southern wing of Virgo, so as to check its longitude by working it out twice.\nI could make use of Tycho\u2019s line of reasoning, which he routinely adopted in volume I of the Progymnasmata when (as here) the declination of the planet was not known. But because that method extends to ten operations, I prefer for the sake of brevity to proceed as I did before with my own observations. Here there are no hidden dangers.\nFirst, the star in the wing of Virgo, adjusted to our time, is at 4\u00b0 36\u2019 30\u201c Libra with latitude 2\u00b0 50\u2019 north. Fabricius found that Mars is 20\u00b0 18\u2019 westward from it on the zodiac, which puts Mars at about 14\u00b0 18\u2019 30\u201c Virgo. This is a preliminary, approximate figure: the longitude will shortly be corrected. Now the tail of Leo31 is at 16\u00b0 4\u2019 Virgo, with latitude 12\u00b0 18\u2019 North, and Mars was found to be 8\u00b0 17\u2019 distant from the Tail. What is sought is the distance of its parallel from the Tail, since the difference in longitude is 1\u00b0 45\u2019. Dividing the secant of 8\u00b0 17\u2019 by the secant of 1\u00b0 45\u2019 gives the secant of 8\u00b0 6\u2019, the arc sought. This subtracted from the fixed star\u2019s northern latitude of 12\u00b0 18\u2019 leaves Mars\u2019s latitude, 4\u00b0 12\u2019 north. This I now take as determined, and compare it with the latitudes of the fixed stars according to the laws of trigonometry. From the Wing of Virgo, I find Mars\u2019s longitude to be 14\u00b0 19\u2019 Virgo; from the Neck of Leo, 14\u00b0 23\u2019 36\u201c. The mean of these two is 14\u00b0 21\u2019 18\u201c Virgo. And since the sextant gave distances larger than the truth, the latitude would come out at 4\u00b0 14\u2019 north.\nOn the night following February 23, at 12h, he observed Mars in relation to five fixed stars: the Tail of Leo and Arcturus for latitude, and for the longitude, in the first instance, Spica (which followed it), and, in the second, the Neck of Leo and Cor Leonis (which preceded it).\nBy a rough estimate, I foresee that Mars is going to fall at 11\u00bc\u00b0 Virgo. It was found to be 9\u00b0 24\u2019 from the Tail of Leo, and hence, its latitude comes out at 4\u00b0 6\u2019 ^32. And now, through this and the latitudes of the fixed stars, together with their distances (17\u00b0 26\u2019 from Regulus, 17\u00b0 51\u2019 from the Neck of Leo, 37\u00b0 28\u2019 from Spica, 44\u00b0 15\u2019 from Arcturus), Mars\u2019s position comes out at 11\u00b0 21\u2019 23\u201c Virgo (from Regulus), 11\u00b0 20\u2019 52\u201c Virgo (from the Neck of Leo), and 11\u00b0 17\u2019 40\u201c (from Spica). Again (as you see) the distances err in being too great. For from the Heart and the Neck [of Leo], Mars is pushed a little eastward, and from Spica and Arcturus a little westward, and more from Arcturus, owing to its greater northern latitude ^33. The mean (ignoring Arcturus), 11\u00b0 19\u2019 20\u201c Virgo, is very nearly true. Also, the latitude is greater, namely, 4\u00b0 7\u2019 40\u201c north. Now from February 15 at 17h to 23 February at 12h, a period of 7 days 19 hours, Mars moved 3\u00b0 0\u2019: 180 minutes in 187 hours. That is, about one minute per hour. And if you wish to take it into account, the parallax (if any) is subtracted from the longitude on February 16 and a little is added on February 23.\n Because the last observation follows the time of observation found by me by 2 days 21 hours 47 min., add the motion corresponding to this time, 1\u00b0 7\u2019: the position will come out 12\u00b0 26\u2019 Virgo. The agreement is thus very good\u2014it could not be better\u2014given that both of us [that is, Kepler and Fabricius] work independently and do not rely on the facilities used by Tycho Brahe.","1711":"VIII. On 1595 October 30 at 8h 20m, the planet was found at 17\u00b0 47\u2019 15\u201c Taurus,19 not far from the nonagesimal. We may thus be sure of the parallax, although we must take it into account. The latitude was 0\u00b0 5\u2019 10\u201c north. The sun\u2019s position was 16\u00b0 50\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio. The distance between the stars was 56\u2019 45\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 35\u201c; that of Mars, 22\u2019 54\u201c, as appears by comparing the nearby observations. The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 23\u2019 29\u201c. If the distance between the stars be divided by this, it comes out to 40\u2019 47\u201c of a day, or 16 hours 19 min. Therefore, the true opposition was 0h 39m PM on October 31. Mars\u2019s position was 17\u00b0 31\u2019 40\u201c Taurus. This needs no reduction to the orbit, as it is nearly at the node. The latitude was about 0\u00b0 8\u2019 north. But comparison with the preceding and following days shows a latitude of about 5\u2019 north.\nIX. Let, at any rate, Mars\u2019s position on 1597 December 10 at 8h 30m be 3\u00b0 45\u00bd\u2019 Cancer (as above) ^20. The sun\u2019s position was 29\u00b0 4\u2019 53\u201c Sagittarius. The distance between the stars was 4\u00b0 40\u2019 37\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 61\u2019 20\u201c, that of Mars 23\u2019 40\u201c (for in 1580 the diurnal motion in Gemini was 23\u2019, and in 1582, at 17\u00b0 Cancer, it was 24\u2019). Therefore, the sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 25\u2019 0\u201c. These data show that the time of true opposition followed 3 days 7 hours 14 min. later, on December 14 at 3h 44m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 2\u00b0 27\u2153\u2019 Cancer. The reduction to the orbit (quite ridiculous here, since the observation itself has an uncertainty of several minutes) requires the addition of about 52\u201c. Therefore, the corrected position was 2\u00b0 28\u2019 Cancer. The latitude, from the table, was 3\u00b0 33\u2019 north.\nOn the same night, the one following December 10, at 12\u2159h, Fabricius in East Frisia found Mars\u2019s position to be 3\u00b0 40\u00bc\u2019 Cancer with latitude 3\u00b0 23\u2019 N. In this observation the longitude comes out nearly the same. For the motion over 3h 40m is 3\u00bd\u2019, so that in the Brahean observation too, at 12\u2159h Mars could have been at 3\u00b0 42\u2019 Cancer\u2014two minutes beyond the Fabrician position.\nX. On 1600 January 13\/23 at 11h 40m, the time being adjusted to Uraniborg time, the planet was observed at 10\u00b0 38\u2019 46\u201c Leo ^21. The sun\u2019s position was 3\u00b0 26\u2019 30\u201c Aquarius. The stars were 7\u00b0 12\u2019 16\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion for the next few days was 1\u00b0 1\u2019 3\u201c; that of Mars, 23\u2019 44\u201c. The sum: 1\u00b0 24\u2019 47\u201c. The opposition therefore followed 5 days 2h 22m after; that is, on January 19\/29 at 2h 2m in the morning, before dawn. Mars was at 8\u00b0 38\u2019 Leo. There is no need for reduction, since it is near the limit. The latitude, from the table, was 4\u00b0 30\u2019 50\u201c N.\nXI. On the evening of 1602 Febr. 18\/28 at 10h 30m, using the Tychonic  instruments (with the help of the learned Matthias Seiffard,22 bequeathed us by Tycho), I took the distance of Mars from the middle star of the tail of Ursa Major 23 to be 52\u00b0 22\u2019. And since the distance between Cor Leonis and Procyon was 37\u00b0 22\u2019 20\u201c, which should have been 37\u00b0 19\u2019 50\u201c,24 we know that the sextant reads 2\u00bd minutes high. Therefore, the corrected distance of Mars from the tail of Ursa was 52\u00b0 19\u00bd\u2019. And since the latitude of the fixed star is 56\u00b0 22\u2019, the remainder, by subtraction, is 4\u00b0 2\u00bd\u2019\u2014supposing that Mars was at precisely the same longitude as the fixed star. But because there was a difference of 3\u00be degrees between them (as is clear from the following observations), a slight correction is required.\n For let AB be 3\u00b0 43\u2019 30\u201c on a parallel close to the ecliptic, B Mars, C the fixed star, and BC 52\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c. Dividing the secant of BC by the secant of AB gives the  secant of CA, 52\u00b0 14\u2019, which, subtracted from 56\u00b0 22\u2019 (the latitude of the fixed star) leaves 4\u00b0 8\u2019 north as Mars\u2019s observed latitude. At the same time, we found 19\u00b0 23\u2019 between Mars and Cor Leonis (19\u00b0 20\u00bd corrected), and 21\u00b0 20\u2019 between Mars and the bright star in the wing of Virgo25 (21\u00b0 17\u00bd\u2019 corrected). From these two distances (using the latitudes of the stars and Mars), Mars\u2019s longitude is found to be 13\u00b0 19\u2019 6\u201c Virgo, by consensus of all measurements.\nAlternatively, the meridian altitude of Mars was found at 12h 40m, using two quadrants, to be 50\u00b0 19\u2019, while the tail of Leo26 was 56\u00b0 45\u2019. Therefore, from the declinations and right ascensions of the fixed stars and our distances, Mars\u2019s position is determined as 13\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c Virgo, latitude 4\u00b0 7\u2019 55\u201c ^27. This is the Tychonic procedure. I have included the other for the sake of showing a consensus, and also that it might be evident that despite the lack of absolute perfection in the demonstration, short cuts either in computation or in our understanding can under certain circumstances be applied. For in that previous procedure there is less in the actual work than in the reporting of it. At Prague, 5\u00b0 Scorpio was rising ^28. Therefore, the nonagesimal was about 32\u00bd\u00b0 from the zenith. And since Mars\u2019s distance from the earth was rather more than half the sun\u2019s distance, the resulting parallax of about 5\u2019 opposite 32\u00bd\u00b0 in our parallactic table, shows a latitudinal parallax of 2\u2019 41\u201c. Thus the latitude as seen from the middle of the earth would be 4\u00b0 10\u2154\u2019 north. And because the altitude of the nonagesimal was 57\u00bd\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax at the horizon was 4\u2019 13\u201c. But since Mars was 38\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, the longitudinal parallax corresponding to this position is 2\u2019 36\u201c, and if this be eliminated, Mars would be placed at about 13\u00b0 18\u2019 Virgo ^29. At that moment, the sun\u2019s position was 10\u00b0 16\u2019 42\u201c Pisces. The distance between the bodies was 3\u00b0 1\u2019 18\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 4\u201c, and that of Mars, 24\u2019 5\u201c (for it was 24\u2019 18\u201c at 21\u00b0 Leo in 1585, and 24\u2019 at 26 Virgo in 1587). The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 24\u2019 9\u201c. The true opposition therefore followed 2 days 3 hours 43 minutes later, on 21 February\/3 March before dawn at 2h 13m, Mars being at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 35\u201c Virgo. Forty seconds must be subtracted to reduce the position to the orbit, putting Mars at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 Virgo, with slightly less latitude than before, since the latitude was then decreasing. It was therefore about 4\u00b0 10\u2019, or 4\u00b0 7\u2153\u2019 if the parallax be neglected.\n But because, since Tycho\u2019s death, we have not made frequent observations nor continued them over several days, it would be best, for certainty\u2019s sake, also to make use of those observations which David Fabricius of East Frisia, a sedulous practitioner of astronomy, has communicated to me.\nOn February 16, old style, at 5h in the morning, he took the planet\u2019s distances from the tail of Leo (for the latitude), from the neck of Leo,30 and, on the other hand, from the bright star in the southern wing of Virgo, so as to check its longitude by working it out twice.\nI could make use of Tycho\u2019s line of reasoning, which he routinely adopted in volume I of the Progymnasmata when (as here) the declination of the planet was not known. But because that method extends to ten operations, I prefer for the sake of brevity to proceed as I did before with my own observations. Here there are no hidden dangers.\nFirst, the star in the wing of Virgo, adjusted to our time, is at 4\u00b0 36\u2019 30\u201c Libra with latitude 2\u00b0 50\u2019 north. Fabricius found that Mars is 20\u00b0 18\u2019 westward from it on the zodiac, which puts Mars at about 14\u00b0 18\u2019 30\u201c Virgo. This is a preliminary, approximate figure: the longitude will shortly be corrected. Now the tail of Leo31 is at 16\u00b0 4\u2019 Virgo, with latitude 12\u00b0 18\u2019 North, and Mars was found to be 8\u00b0 17\u2019 distant from the Tail. What is sought is the distance of its parallel from the Tail, since the difference in longitude is 1\u00b0 45\u2019. Dividing the secant of 8\u00b0 17\u2019 by the secant of 1\u00b0 45\u2019 gives the secant of 8\u00b0 6\u2019, the arc sought. This subtracted from the fixed star\u2019s northern latitude of 12\u00b0 18\u2019 leaves Mars\u2019s latitude, 4\u00b0 12\u2019 north. This I now take as determined, and compare it with the latitudes of the fixed stars according to the laws of trigonometry. From the Wing of Virgo, I find Mars\u2019s longitude to be 14\u00b0 19\u2019 Virgo; from the Neck of Leo, 14\u00b0 23\u2019 36\u201c. The mean of these two is 14\u00b0 21\u2019 18\u201c Virgo. And since the sextant gave distances larger than the truth, the latitude would come out at 4\u00b0 14\u2019 north.\nOn the night following February 23, at 12h, he observed Mars in relation to five fixed stars: the Tail of Leo and Arcturus for latitude, and for the longitude, in the first instance, Spica (which followed it), and, in the second, the Neck of Leo and Cor Leonis (which preceded it).\nBy a rough estimate, I foresee that Mars is going to fall at 11\u00bc\u00b0 Virgo. It was found to be 9\u00b0 24\u2019 from the Tail of Leo, and hence, its latitude comes out at 4\u00b0 6\u2019 ^32. And now, through this and the latitudes of the fixed stars, together with their distances (17\u00b0 26\u2019 from Regulus, 17\u00b0 51\u2019 from the Neck of Leo, 37\u00b0 28\u2019 from Spica, 44\u00b0 15\u2019 from Arcturus), Mars\u2019s position comes out at 11\u00b0 21\u2019 23\u201c Virgo (from Regulus), 11\u00b0 20\u2019 52\u201c Virgo (from the Neck of Leo), and 11\u00b0 17\u2019 40\u201c (from Spica). Again (as you see) the distances err in being too great. For from the Heart and the Neck [of Leo], Mars is pushed a little eastward, and from Spica and Arcturus a little westward, and more from Arcturus, owing to its greater northern latitude ^33. The mean (ignoring Arcturus), 11\u00b0 19\u2019 20\u201c Virgo, is very nearly true. Also, the latitude is greater, namely, 4\u00b0 7\u2019 40\u201c north. Now from February 15 at 17h to 23 February at 12h, a period of 7 days 19 hours, Mars moved 3\u00b0 0\u2019: 180 minutes in 187 hours. That is, about one minute per hour. And if you wish to take it into account, the parallax (if any) is subtracted from the longitude on February 16 and a little is added on February 23.\n Because the last observation follows the time of observation found by me by 2 days 21 hours 47 min., add the motion corresponding to this time, 1\u00b0 7\u2019: the position will come out 12\u00b0 26\u2019 Virgo. The agreement is thus very good\u2014it could not be better\u2014given that both of us [that is, Kepler and Fabricius] work independently and do not rely on the facilities used by Tycho Brahe.","1712":"VIII. On 1595 October 30 at 8h 20m, the planet was found at 17\u00b0 47\u2019 15\u201c Taurus,19 not far from the nonagesimal. We may thus be sure of the parallax, although we must take it into account. The latitude was 0\u00b0 5\u2019 10\u201c north. The sun\u2019s position was 16\u00b0 50\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio. The distance between the stars was 56\u2019 45\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 35\u201c; that of Mars, 22\u2019 54\u201c, as appears by comparing the nearby observations. The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 23\u2019 29\u201c. If the distance between the stars be divided by this, it comes out to 40\u2019 47\u201c of a day, or 16 hours 19 min. Therefore, the true opposition was 0h 39m PM on October 31. Mars\u2019s position was 17\u00b0 31\u2019 40\u201c Taurus. This needs no reduction to the orbit, as it is nearly at the node. The latitude was about 0\u00b0 8\u2019 north. But comparison with the preceding and following days shows a latitude of about 5\u2019 north.\nIX. Let, at any rate, Mars\u2019s position on 1597 December 10 at 8h 30m be 3\u00b0 45\u00bd\u2019 Cancer (as above) ^20. The sun\u2019s position was 29\u00b0 4\u2019 53\u201c Sagittarius. The distance between the stars was 4\u00b0 40\u2019 37\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 61\u2019 20\u201c, that of Mars 23\u2019 40\u201c (for in 1580 the diurnal motion in Gemini was 23\u2019, and in 1582, at 17\u00b0 Cancer, it was 24\u2019). Therefore, the sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 25\u2019 0\u201c. These data show that the time of true opposition followed 3 days 7 hours 14 min. later, on December 14 at 3h 44m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 2\u00b0 27\u2153\u2019 Cancer. The reduction to the orbit (quite ridiculous here, since the observation itself has an uncertainty of several minutes) requires the addition of about 52\u201c. Therefore, the corrected position was 2\u00b0 28\u2019 Cancer. The latitude, from the table, was 3\u00b0 33\u2019 north.\nOn the same night, the one following December 10, at 12\u2159h, Fabricius in East Frisia found Mars\u2019s position to be 3\u00b0 40\u00bc\u2019 Cancer with latitude 3\u00b0 23\u2019 N. In this observation the longitude comes out nearly the same. For the motion over 3h 40m is 3\u00bd\u2019, so that in the Brahean observation too, at 12\u2159h Mars could have been at 3\u00b0 42\u2019 Cancer\u2014two minutes beyond the Fabrician position.\nX. On 1600 January 13\/23 at 11h 40m, the time being adjusted to Uraniborg time, the planet was observed at 10\u00b0 38\u2019 46\u201c Leo ^21. The sun\u2019s position was 3\u00b0 26\u2019 30\u201c Aquarius. The stars were 7\u00b0 12\u2019 16\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion for the next few days was 1\u00b0 1\u2019 3\u201c; that of Mars, 23\u2019 44\u201c. The sum: 1\u00b0 24\u2019 47\u201c. The opposition therefore followed 5 days 2h 22m after; that is, on January 19\/29 at 2h 2m in the morning, before dawn. Mars was at 8\u00b0 38\u2019 Leo. There is no need for reduction, since it is near the limit. The latitude, from the table, was 4\u00b0 30\u2019 50\u201c N.\nXI. On the evening of 1602 Febr. 18\/28 at 10h 30m, using the Tychonic  instruments (with the help of the learned Matthias Seiffard,22 bequeathed us by Tycho), I took the distance of Mars from the middle star of the tail of Ursa Major 23 to be 52\u00b0 22\u2019. And since the distance between Cor Leonis and Procyon was 37\u00b0 22\u2019 20\u201c, which should have been 37\u00b0 19\u2019 50\u201c,24 we know that the sextant reads 2\u00bd minutes high. Therefore, the corrected distance of Mars from the tail of Ursa was 52\u00b0 19\u00bd\u2019. And since the latitude of the fixed star is 56\u00b0 22\u2019, the remainder, by subtraction, is 4\u00b0 2\u00bd\u2019\u2014supposing that Mars was at precisely the same longitude as the fixed star. But because there was a difference of 3\u00be degrees between them (as is clear from the following observations), a slight correction is required.\n For let AB be 3\u00b0 43\u2019 30\u201c on a parallel close to the ecliptic, B Mars, C the fixed star, and BC 52\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c. Dividing the secant of BC by the secant of AB gives the  secant of CA, 52\u00b0 14\u2019, which, subtracted from 56\u00b0 22\u2019 (the latitude of the fixed star) leaves 4\u00b0 8\u2019 north as Mars\u2019s observed latitude. At the same time, we found 19\u00b0 23\u2019 between Mars and Cor Leonis (19\u00b0 20\u00bd corrected), and 21\u00b0 20\u2019 between Mars and the bright star in the wing of Virgo25 (21\u00b0 17\u00bd\u2019 corrected). From these two distances (using the latitudes of the stars and Mars), Mars\u2019s longitude is found to be 13\u00b0 19\u2019 6\u201c Virgo, by consensus of all measurements.\nAlternatively, the meridian altitude of Mars was found at 12h 40m, using two quadrants, to be 50\u00b0 19\u2019, while the tail of Leo26 was 56\u00b0 45\u2019. Therefore, from the declinations and right ascensions of the fixed stars and our distances, Mars\u2019s position is determined as 13\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c Virgo, latitude 4\u00b0 7\u2019 55\u201c ^27. This is the Tychonic procedure. I have included the other for the sake of showing a consensus, and also that it might be evident that despite the lack of absolute perfection in the demonstration, short cuts either in computation or in our understanding can under certain circumstances be applied. For in that previous procedure there is less in the actual work than in the reporting of it. At Prague, 5\u00b0 Scorpio was rising ^28. Therefore, the nonagesimal was about 32\u00bd\u00b0 from the zenith. And since Mars\u2019s distance from the earth was rather more than half the sun\u2019s distance, the resulting parallax of about 5\u2019 opposite 32\u00bd\u00b0 in our parallactic table, shows a latitudinal parallax of 2\u2019 41\u201c. Thus the latitude as seen from the middle of the earth would be 4\u00b0 10\u2154\u2019 north. And because the altitude of the nonagesimal was 57\u00bd\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax at the horizon was 4\u2019 13\u201c. But since Mars was 38\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, the longitudinal parallax corresponding to this position is 2\u2019 36\u201c, and if this be eliminated, Mars would be placed at about 13\u00b0 18\u2019 Virgo ^29. At that moment, the sun\u2019s position was 10\u00b0 16\u2019 42\u201c Pisces. The distance between the bodies was 3\u00b0 1\u2019 18\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 4\u201c, and that of Mars, 24\u2019 5\u201c (for it was 24\u2019 18\u201c at 21\u00b0 Leo in 1585, and 24\u2019 at 26 Virgo in 1587). The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 24\u2019 9\u201c. The true opposition therefore followed 2 days 3 hours 43 minutes later, on 21 February\/3 March before dawn at 2h 13m, Mars being at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 35\u201c Virgo. Forty seconds must be subtracted to reduce the position to the orbit, putting Mars at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 Virgo, with slightly less latitude than before, since the latitude was then decreasing. It was therefore about 4\u00b0 10\u2019, or 4\u00b0 7\u2153\u2019 if the parallax be neglected.\n But because, since Tycho\u2019s death, we have not made frequent observations nor continued them over several days, it would be best, for certainty\u2019s sake, also to make use of those observations which David Fabricius of East Frisia, a sedulous practitioner of astronomy, has communicated to me.\nOn February 16, old style, at 5h in the morning, he took the planet\u2019s distances from the tail of Leo (for the latitude), from the neck of Leo,30 and, on the other hand, from the bright star in the southern wing of Virgo, so as to check its longitude by working it out twice.\nI could make use of Tycho\u2019s line of reasoning, which he routinely adopted in volume I of the Progymnasmata when (as here) the declination of the planet was not known. But because that method extends to ten operations, I prefer for the sake of brevity to proceed as I did before with my own observations. Here there are no hidden dangers.\nFirst, the star in the wing of Virgo, adjusted to our time, is at 4\u00b0 36\u2019 30\u201c Libra with latitude 2\u00b0 50\u2019 north. Fabricius found that Mars is 20\u00b0 18\u2019 westward from it on the zodiac, which puts Mars at about 14\u00b0 18\u2019 30\u201c Virgo. This is a preliminary, approximate figure: the longitude will shortly be corrected. Now the tail of Leo31 is at 16\u00b0 4\u2019 Virgo, with latitude 12\u00b0 18\u2019 North, and Mars was found to be 8\u00b0 17\u2019 distant from the Tail. What is sought is the distance of its parallel from the Tail, since the difference in longitude is 1\u00b0 45\u2019. Dividing the secant of 8\u00b0 17\u2019 by the secant of 1\u00b0 45\u2019 gives the secant of 8\u00b0 6\u2019, the arc sought. This subtracted from the fixed star\u2019s northern latitude of 12\u00b0 18\u2019 leaves Mars\u2019s latitude, 4\u00b0 12\u2019 north. This I now take as determined, and compare it with the latitudes of the fixed stars according to the laws of trigonometry. From the Wing of Virgo, I find Mars\u2019s longitude to be 14\u00b0 19\u2019 Virgo; from the Neck of Leo, 14\u00b0 23\u2019 36\u201c. The mean of these two is 14\u00b0 21\u2019 18\u201c Virgo. And since the sextant gave distances larger than the truth, the latitude would come out at 4\u00b0 14\u2019 north.\nOn the night following February 23, at 12h, he observed Mars in relation to five fixed stars: the Tail of Leo and Arcturus for latitude, and for the longitude, in the first instance, Spica (which followed it), and, in the second, the Neck of Leo and Cor Leonis (which preceded it).\nBy a rough estimate, I foresee that Mars is going to fall at 11\u00bc\u00b0 Virgo. It was found to be 9\u00b0 24\u2019 from the Tail of Leo, and hence, its latitude comes out at 4\u00b0 6\u2019 ^32. And now, through this and the latitudes of the fixed stars, together with their distances (17\u00b0 26\u2019 from Regulus, 17\u00b0 51\u2019 from the Neck of Leo, 37\u00b0 28\u2019 from Spica, 44\u00b0 15\u2019 from Arcturus), Mars\u2019s position comes out at 11\u00b0 21\u2019 23\u201c Virgo (from Regulus), 11\u00b0 20\u2019 52\u201c Virgo (from the Neck of Leo), and 11\u00b0 17\u2019 40\u201c (from Spica). Again (as you see) the distances err in being too great. For from the Heart and the Neck [of Leo], Mars is pushed a little eastward, and from Spica and Arcturus a little westward, and more from Arcturus, owing to its greater northern latitude ^33. The mean (ignoring Arcturus), 11\u00b0 19\u2019 20\u201c Virgo, is very nearly true. Also, the latitude is greater, namely, 4\u00b0 7\u2019 40\u201c north. Now from February 15 at 17h to 23 February at 12h, a period of 7 days 19 hours, Mars moved 3\u00b0 0\u2019: 180 minutes in 187 hours. That is, about one minute per hour. And if you wish to take it into account, the parallax (if any) is subtracted from the longitude on February 16 and a little is added on February 23.\n Because the last observation follows the time of observation found by me by 2 days 21 hours 47 min., add the motion corresponding to this time, 1\u00b0 7\u2019: the position will come out 12\u00b0 26\u2019 Virgo. The agreement is thus very good\u2014it could not be better\u2014given that both of us [that is, Kepler and Fabricius] work independently and do not rely on the facilities used by Tycho Brahe.","1713":"VIII. On 1595 October 30 at 8h 20m, the planet was found at 17\u00b0 47\u2019 15\u201c Taurus,19 not far from the nonagesimal. We may thus be sure of the parallax, although we must take it into account. The latitude was 0\u00b0 5\u2019 10\u201c north. The sun\u2019s position was 16\u00b0 50\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio. The distance between the stars was 56\u2019 45\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 35\u201c; that of Mars, 22\u2019 54\u201c, as appears by comparing the nearby observations. The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 23\u2019 29\u201c. If the distance between the stars be divided by this, it comes out to 40\u2019 47\u201c of a day, or 16 hours 19 min. Therefore, the true opposition was 0h 39m PM on October 31. Mars\u2019s position was 17\u00b0 31\u2019 40\u201c Taurus. This needs no reduction to the orbit, as it is nearly at the node. The latitude was about 0\u00b0 8\u2019 north. But comparison with the preceding and following days shows a latitude of about 5\u2019 north.\nIX. Let, at any rate, Mars\u2019s position on 1597 December 10 at 8h 30m be 3\u00b0 45\u00bd\u2019 Cancer (as above) ^20. The sun\u2019s position was 29\u00b0 4\u2019 53\u201c Sagittarius. The distance between the stars was 4\u00b0 40\u2019 37\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 61\u2019 20\u201c, that of Mars 23\u2019 40\u201c (for in 1580 the diurnal motion in Gemini was 23\u2019, and in 1582, at 17\u00b0 Cancer, it was 24\u2019). Therefore, the sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 25\u2019 0\u201c. These data show that the time of true opposition followed 3 days 7 hours 14 min. later, on December 14 at 3h 44m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 2\u00b0 27\u2153\u2019 Cancer. The reduction to the orbit (quite ridiculous here, since the observation itself has an uncertainty of several minutes) requires the addition of about 52\u201c. Therefore, the corrected position was 2\u00b0 28\u2019 Cancer. The latitude, from the table, was 3\u00b0 33\u2019 north.\nOn the same night, the one following December 10, at 12\u2159h, Fabricius in East Frisia found Mars\u2019s position to be 3\u00b0 40\u00bc\u2019 Cancer with latitude 3\u00b0 23\u2019 N. In this observation the longitude comes out nearly the same. For the motion over 3h 40m is 3\u00bd\u2019, so that in the Brahean observation too, at 12\u2159h Mars could have been at 3\u00b0 42\u2019 Cancer\u2014two minutes beyond the Fabrician position.\nX. On 1600 January 13\/23 at 11h 40m, the time being adjusted to Uraniborg time, the planet was observed at 10\u00b0 38\u2019 46\u201c Leo ^21. The sun\u2019s position was 3\u00b0 26\u2019 30\u201c Aquarius. The stars were 7\u00b0 12\u2019 16\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion for the next few days was 1\u00b0 1\u2019 3\u201c; that of Mars, 23\u2019 44\u201c. The sum: 1\u00b0 24\u2019 47\u201c. The opposition therefore followed 5 days 2h 22m after; that is, on January 19\/29 at 2h 2m in the morning, before dawn. Mars was at 8\u00b0 38\u2019 Leo. There is no need for reduction, since it is near the limit. The latitude, from the table, was 4\u00b0 30\u2019 50\u201c N.\nXI. On the evening of 1602 Febr. 18\/28 at 10h 30m, using the Tychonic  instruments (with the help of the learned Matthias Seiffard,22 bequeathed us by Tycho), I took the distance of Mars from the middle star of the tail of Ursa Major 23 to be 52\u00b0 22\u2019. And since the distance between Cor Leonis and Procyon was 37\u00b0 22\u2019 20\u201c, which should have been 37\u00b0 19\u2019 50\u201c,24 we know that the sextant reads 2\u00bd minutes high. Therefore, the corrected distance of Mars from the tail of Ursa was 52\u00b0 19\u00bd\u2019. And since the latitude of the fixed star is 56\u00b0 22\u2019, the remainder, by subtraction, is 4\u00b0 2\u00bd\u2019\u2014supposing that Mars was at precisely the same longitude as the fixed star. But because there was a difference of 3\u00be degrees between them (as is clear from the following observations), a slight correction is required.\n For let AB be 3\u00b0 43\u2019 30\u201c on a parallel close to the ecliptic, B Mars, C the fixed star, and BC 52\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c. Dividing the secant of BC by the secant of AB gives the  secant of CA, 52\u00b0 14\u2019, which, subtracted from 56\u00b0 22\u2019 (the latitude of the fixed star) leaves 4\u00b0 8\u2019 north as Mars\u2019s observed latitude. At the same time, we found 19\u00b0 23\u2019 between Mars and Cor Leonis (19\u00b0 20\u00bd corrected), and 21\u00b0 20\u2019 between Mars and the bright star in the wing of Virgo25 (21\u00b0 17\u00bd\u2019 corrected). From these two distances (using the latitudes of the stars and Mars), Mars\u2019s longitude is found to be 13\u00b0 19\u2019 6\u201c Virgo, by consensus of all measurements.\nAlternatively, the meridian altitude of Mars was found at 12h 40m, using two quadrants, to be 50\u00b0 19\u2019, while the tail of Leo26 was 56\u00b0 45\u2019. Therefore, from the declinations and right ascensions of the fixed stars and our distances, Mars\u2019s position is determined as 13\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c Virgo, latitude 4\u00b0 7\u2019 55\u201c ^27. This is the Tychonic procedure. I have included the other for the sake of showing a consensus, and also that it might be evident that despite the lack of absolute perfection in the demonstration, short cuts either in computation or in our understanding can under certain circumstances be applied. For in that previous procedure there is less in the actual work than in the reporting of it. At Prague, 5\u00b0 Scorpio was rising ^28. Therefore, the nonagesimal was about 32\u00bd\u00b0 from the zenith. And since Mars\u2019s distance from the earth was rather more than half the sun\u2019s distance, the resulting parallax of about 5\u2019 opposite 32\u00bd\u00b0 in our parallactic table, shows a latitudinal parallax of 2\u2019 41\u201c. Thus the latitude as seen from the middle of the earth would be 4\u00b0 10\u2154\u2019 north. And because the altitude of the nonagesimal was 57\u00bd\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax at the horizon was 4\u2019 13\u201c. But since Mars was 38\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, the longitudinal parallax corresponding to this position is 2\u2019 36\u201c, and if this be eliminated, Mars would be placed at about 13\u00b0 18\u2019 Virgo ^29. At that moment, the sun\u2019s position was 10\u00b0 16\u2019 42\u201c Pisces. The distance between the bodies was 3\u00b0 1\u2019 18\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 4\u201c, and that of Mars, 24\u2019 5\u201c (for it was 24\u2019 18\u201c at 21\u00b0 Leo in 1585, and 24\u2019 at 26 Virgo in 1587). The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 24\u2019 9\u201c. The true opposition therefore followed 2 days 3 hours 43 minutes later, on 21 February\/3 March before dawn at 2h 13m, Mars being at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 35\u201c Virgo. Forty seconds must be subtracted to reduce the position to the orbit, putting Mars at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 Virgo, with slightly less latitude than before, since the latitude was then decreasing. It was therefore about 4\u00b0 10\u2019, or 4\u00b0 7\u2153\u2019 if the parallax be neglected.\n But because, since Tycho\u2019s death, we have not made frequent observations nor continued them over several days, it would be best, for certainty\u2019s sake, also to make use of those observations which David Fabricius of East Frisia, a sedulous practitioner of astronomy, has communicated to me.\nOn February 16, old style, at 5h in the morning, he took the planet\u2019s distances from the tail of Leo (for the latitude), from the neck of Leo,30 and, on the other hand, from the bright star in the southern wing of Virgo, so as to check its longitude by working it out twice.\nI could make use of Tycho\u2019s line of reasoning, which he routinely adopted in volume I of the Progymnasmata when (as here) the declination of the planet was not known. But because that method extends to ten operations, I prefer for the sake of brevity to proceed as I did before with my own observations. Here there are no hidden dangers.\nFirst, the star in the wing of Virgo, adjusted to our time, is at 4\u00b0 36\u2019 30\u201c Libra with latitude 2\u00b0 50\u2019 north. Fabricius found that Mars is 20\u00b0 18\u2019 westward from it on the zodiac, which puts Mars at about 14\u00b0 18\u2019 30\u201c Virgo. This is a preliminary, approximate figure: the longitude will shortly be corrected. Now the tail of Leo31 is at 16\u00b0 4\u2019 Virgo, with latitude 12\u00b0 18\u2019 North, and Mars was found to be 8\u00b0 17\u2019 distant from the Tail. What is sought is the distance of its parallel from the Tail, since the difference in longitude is 1\u00b0 45\u2019. Dividing the secant of 8\u00b0 17\u2019 by the secant of 1\u00b0 45\u2019 gives the secant of 8\u00b0 6\u2019, the arc sought. This subtracted from the fixed star\u2019s northern latitude of 12\u00b0 18\u2019 leaves Mars\u2019s latitude, 4\u00b0 12\u2019 north. This I now take as determined, and compare it with the latitudes of the fixed stars according to the laws of trigonometry. From the Wing of Virgo, I find Mars\u2019s longitude to be 14\u00b0 19\u2019 Virgo; from the Neck of Leo, 14\u00b0 23\u2019 36\u201c. The mean of these two is 14\u00b0 21\u2019 18\u201c Virgo. And since the sextant gave distances larger than the truth, the latitude would come out at 4\u00b0 14\u2019 north.\nOn the night following February 23, at 12h, he observed Mars in relation to five fixed stars: the Tail of Leo and Arcturus for latitude, and for the longitude, in the first instance, Spica (which followed it), and, in the second, the Neck of Leo and Cor Leonis (which preceded it).\nBy a rough estimate, I foresee that Mars is going to fall at 11\u00bc\u00b0 Virgo. It was found to be 9\u00b0 24\u2019 from the Tail of Leo, and hence, its latitude comes out at 4\u00b0 6\u2019 ^32. And now, through this and the latitudes of the fixed stars, together with their distances (17\u00b0 26\u2019 from Regulus, 17\u00b0 51\u2019 from the Neck of Leo, 37\u00b0 28\u2019 from Spica, 44\u00b0 15\u2019 from Arcturus), Mars\u2019s position comes out at 11\u00b0 21\u2019 23\u201c Virgo (from Regulus), 11\u00b0 20\u2019 52\u201c Virgo (from the Neck of Leo), and 11\u00b0 17\u2019 40\u201c (from Spica). Again (as you see) the distances err in being too great. For from the Heart and the Neck [of Leo], Mars is pushed a little eastward, and from Spica and Arcturus a little westward, and more from Arcturus, owing to its greater northern latitude ^33. The mean (ignoring Arcturus), 11\u00b0 19\u2019 20\u201c Virgo, is very nearly true. Also, the latitude is greater, namely, 4\u00b0 7\u2019 40\u201c north. Now from February 15 at 17h to 23 February at 12h, a period of 7 days 19 hours, Mars moved 3\u00b0 0\u2019: 180 minutes in 187 hours. That is, about one minute per hour. And if you wish to take it into account, the parallax (if any) is subtracted from the longitude on February 16 and a little is added on February 23.\n Because the last observation follows the time of observation found by me by 2 days 21 hours 47 min., add the motion corresponding to this time, 1\u00b0 7\u2019: the position will come out 12\u00b0 26\u2019 Virgo. The agreement is thus very good\u2014it could not be better\u2014given that both of us [that is, Kepler and Fabricius] work independently and do not rely on the facilities used by Tycho Brahe.","1714":"VIII. On 1595 October 30 at 8h 20m, the planet was found at 17\u00b0 47\u2019 15\u201c Taurus,19 not far from the nonagesimal. We may thus be sure of the parallax, although we must take it into account. The latitude was 0\u00b0 5\u2019 10\u201c north. The sun\u2019s position was 16\u00b0 50\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio. The distance between the stars was 56\u2019 45\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 35\u201c; that of Mars, 22\u2019 54\u201c, as appears by comparing the nearby observations. The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 23\u2019 29\u201c. If the distance between the stars be divided by this, it comes out to 40\u2019 47\u201c of a day, or 16 hours 19 min. Therefore, the true opposition was 0h 39m PM on October 31. Mars\u2019s position was 17\u00b0 31\u2019 40\u201c Taurus. This needs no reduction to the orbit, as it is nearly at the node. The latitude was about 0\u00b0 8\u2019 north. But comparison with the preceding and following days shows a latitude of about 5\u2019 north.\nIX. Let, at any rate, Mars\u2019s position on 1597 December 10 at 8h 30m be 3\u00b0 45\u00bd\u2019 Cancer (as above) ^20. The sun\u2019s position was 29\u00b0 4\u2019 53\u201c Sagittarius. The distance between the stars was 4\u00b0 40\u2019 37\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 61\u2019 20\u201c, that of Mars 23\u2019 40\u201c (for in 1580 the diurnal motion in Gemini was 23\u2019, and in 1582, at 17\u00b0 Cancer, it was 24\u2019). Therefore, the sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 25\u2019 0\u201c. These data show that the time of true opposition followed 3 days 7 hours 14 min. later, on December 14 at 3h 44m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 2\u00b0 27\u2153\u2019 Cancer. The reduction to the orbit (quite ridiculous here, since the observation itself has an uncertainty of several minutes) requires the addition of about 52\u201c. Therefore, the corrected position was 2\u00b0 28\u2019 Cancer. The latitude, from the table, was 3\u00b0 33\u2019 north.\nOn the same night, the one following December 10, at 12\u2159h, Fabricius in East Frisia found Mars\u2019s position to be 3\u00b0 40\u00bc\u2019 Cancer with latitude 3\u00b0 23\u2019 N. In this observation the longitude comes out nearly the same. For the motion over 3h 40m is 3\u00bd\u2019, so that in the Brahean observation too, at 12\u2159h Mars could have been at 3\u00b0 42\u2019 Cancer\u2014two minutes beyond the Fabrician position.\nX. On 1600 January 13\/23 at 11h 40m, the time being adjusted to Uraniborg time, the planet was observed at 10\u00b0 38\u2019 46\u201c Leo ^21. The sun\u2019s position was 3\u00b0 26\u2019 30\u201c Aquarius. The stars were 7\u00b0 12\u2019 16\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion for the next few days was 1\u00b0 1\u2019 3\u201c; that of Mars, 23\u2019 44\u201c. The sum: 1\u00b0 24\u2019 47\u201c. The opposition therefore followed 5 days 2h 22m after; that is, on January 19\/29 at 2h 2m in the morning, before dawn. Mars was at 8\u00b0 38\u2019 Leo. There is no need for reduction, since it is near the limit. The latitude, from the table, was 4\u00b0 30\u2019 50\u201c N.\nXI. On the evening of 1602 Febr. 18\/28 at 10h 30m, using the Tychonic  instruments (with the help of the learned Matthias Seiffard,22 bequeathed us by Tycho), I took the distance of Mars from the middle star of the tail of Ursa Major 23 to be 52\u00b0 22\u2019. And since the distance between Cor Leonis and Procyon was 37\u00b0 22\u2019 20\u201c, which should have been 37\u00b0 19\u2019 50\u201c,24 we know that the sextant reads 2\u00bd minutes high. Therefore, the corrected distance of Mars from the tail of Ursa was 52\u00b0 19\u00bd\u2019. And since the latitude of the fixed star is 56\u00b0 22\u2019, the remainder, by subtraction, is 4\u00b0 2\u00bd\u2019\u2014supposing that Mars was at precisely the same longitude as the fixed star. But because there was a difference of 3\u00be degrees between them (as is clear from the following observations), a slight correction is required.\n For let AB be 3\u00b0 43\u2019 30\u201c on a parallel close to the ecliptic, B Mars, C the fixed star, and BC 52\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c. Dividing the secant of BC by the secant of AB gives the  secant of CA, 52\u00b0 14\u2019, which, subtracted from 56\u00b0 22\u2019 (the latitude of the fixed star) leaves 4\u00b0 8\u2019 north as Mars\u2019s observed latitude. At the same time, we found 19\u00b0 23\u2019 between Mars and Cor Leonis (19\u00b0 20\u00bd corrected), and 21\u00b0 20\u2019 between Mars and the bright star in the wing of Virgo25 (21\u00b0 17\u00bd\u2019 corrected). From these two distances (using the latitudes of the stars and Mars), Mars\u2019s longitude is found to be 13\u00b0 19\u2019 6\u201c Virgo, by consensus of all measurements.\nAlternatively, the meridian altitude of Mars was found at 12h 40m, using two quadrants, to be 50\u00b0 19\u2019, while the tail of Leo26 was 56\u00b0 45\u2019. Therefore, from the declinations and right ascensions of the fixed stars and our distances, Mars\u2019s position is determined as 13\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c Virgo, latitude 4\u00b0 7\u2019 55\u201c ^27. This is the Tychonic procedure. I have included the other for the sake of showing a consensus, and also that it might be evident that despite the lack of absolute perfection in the demonstration, short cuts either in computation or in our understanding can under certain circumstances be applied. For in that previous procedure there is less in the actual work than in the reporting of it. At Prague, 5\u00b0 Scorpio was rising ^28. Therefore, the nonagesimal was about 32\u00bd\u00b0 from the zenith. And since Mars\u2019s distance from the earth was rather more than half the sun\u2019s distance, the resulting parallax of about 5\u2019 opposite 32\u00bd\u00b0 in our parallactic table, shows a latitudinal parallax of 2\u2019 41\u201c. Thus the latitude as seen from the middle of the earth would be 4\u00b0 10\u2154\u2019 north. And because the altitude of the nonagesimal was 57\u00bd\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax at the horizon was 4\u2019 13\u201c. But since Mars was 38\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, the longitudinal parallax corresponding to this position is 2\u2019 36\u201c, and if this be eliminated, Mars would be placed at about 13\u00b0 18\u2019 Virgo ^29. At that moment, the sun\u2019s position was 10\u00b0 16\u2019 42\u201c Pisces. The distance between the bodies was 3\u00b0 1\u2019 18\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 4\u201c, and that of Mars, 24\u2019 5\u201c (for it was 24\u2019 18\u201c at 21\u00b0 Leo in 1585, and 24\u2019 at 26 Virgo in 1587). The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 24\u2019 9\u201c. The true opposition therefore followed 2 days 3 hours 43 minutes later, on 21 February\/3 March before dawn at 2h 13m, Mars being at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 35\u201c Virgo. Forty seconds must be subtracted to reduce the position to the orbit, putting Mars at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 Virgo, with slightly less latitude than before, since the latitude was then decreasing. It was therefore about 4\u00b0 10\u2019, or 4\u00b0 7\u2153\u2019 if the parallax be neglected.\n But because, since Tycho\u2019s death, we have not made frequent observations nor continued them over several days, it would be best, for certainty\u2019s sake, also to make use of those observations which David Fabricius of East Frisia, a sedulous practitioner of astronomy, has communicated to me.\nOn February 16, old style, at 5h in the morning, he took the planet\u2019s distances from the tail of Leo (for the latitude), from the neck of Leo,30 and, on the other hand, from the bright star in the southern wing of Virgo, so as to check its longitude by working it out twice.\nI could make use of Tycho\u2019s line of reasoning, which he routinely adopted in volume I of the Progymnasmata when (as here) the declination of the planet was not known. But because that method extends to ten operations, I prefer for the sake of brevity to proceed as I did before with my own observations. Here there are no hidden dangers.\nFirst, the star in the wing of Virgo, adjusted to our time, is at 4\u00b0 36\u2019 30\u201c Libra with latitude 2\u00b0 50\u2019 north. Fabricius found that Mars is 20\u00b0 18\u2019 westward from it on the zodiac, which puts Mars at about 14\u00b0 18\u2019 30\u201c Virgo. This is a preliminary, approximate figure: the longitude will shortly be corrected. Now the tail of Leo31 is at 16\u00b0 4\u2019 Virgo, with latitude 12\u00b0 18\u2019 North, and Mars was found to be 8\u00b0 17\u2019 distant from the Tail. What is sought is the distance of its parallel from the Tail, since the difference in longitude is 1\u00b0 45\u2019. Dividing the secant of 8\u00b0 17\u2019 by the secant of 1\u00b0 45\u2019 gives the secant of 8\u00b0 6\u2019, the arc sought. This subtracted from the fixed star\u2019s northern latitude of 12\u00b0 18\u2019 leaves Mars\u2019s latitude, 4\u00b0 12\u2019 north. This I now take as determined, and compare it with the latitudes of the fixed stars according to the laws of trigonometry. From the Wing of Virgo, I find Mars\u2019s longitude to be 14\u00b0 19\u2019 Virgo; from the Neck of Leo, 14\u00b0 23\u2019 36\u201c. The mean of these two is 14\u00b0 21\u2019 18\u201c Virgo. And since the sextant gave distances larger than the truth, the latitude would come out at 4\u00b0 14\u2019 north.\nOn the night following February 23, at 12h, he observed Mars in relation to five fixed stars: the Tail of Leo and Arcturus for latitude, and for the longitude, in the first instance, Spica (which followed it), and, in the second, the Neck of Leo and Cor Leonis (which preceded it).\nBy a rough estimate, I foresee that Mars is going to fall at 11\u00bc\u00b0 Virgo. It was found to be 9\u00b0 24\u2019 from the Tail of Leo, and hence, its latitude comes out at 4\u00b0 6\u2019 ^32. And now, through this and the latitudes of the fixed stars, together with their distances (17\u00b0 26\u2019 from Regulus, 17\u00b0 51\u2019 from the Neck of Leo, 37\u00b0 28\u2019 from Spica, 44\u00b0 15\u2019 from Arcturus), Mars\u2019s position comes out at 11\u00b0 21\u2019 23\u201c Virgo (from Regulus), 11\u00b0 20\u2019 52\u201c Virgo (from the Neck of Leo), and 11\u00b0 17\u2019 40\u201c (from Spica). Again (as you see) the distances err in being too great. For from the Heart and the Neck [of Leo], Mars is pushed a little eastward, and from Spica and Arcturus a little westward, and more from Arcturus, owing to its greater northern latitude ^33. The mean (ignoring Arcturus), 11\u00b0 19\u2019 20\u201c Virgo, is very nearly true. Also, the latitude is greater, namely, 4\u00b0 7\u2019 40\u201c north. Now from February 15 at 17h to 23 February at 12h, a period of 7 days 19 hours, Mars moved 3\u00b0 0\u2019: 180 minutes in 187 hours. That is, about one minute per hour. And if you wish to take it into account, the parallax (if any) is subtracted from the longitude on February 16 and a little is added on February 23.\n Because the last observation follows the time of observation found by me by 2 days 21 hours 47 min., add the motion corresponding to this time, 1\u00b0 7\u2019: the position will come out 12\u00b0 26\u2019 Virgo. The agreement is thus very good\u2014it could not be better\u2014given that both of us [that is, Kepler and Fabricius] work independently and do not rely on the facilities used by Tycho Brahe.","1715":"VIII. On 1595 October 30 at 8h 20m, the planet was found at 17\u00b0 47\u2019 15\u201c Taurus,19 not far from the nonagesimal. We may thus be sure of the parallax, although we must take it into account. The latitude was 0\u00b0 5\u2019 10\u201c north. The sun\u2019s position was 16\u00b0 50\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio. The distance between the stars was 56\u2019 45\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 35\u201c; that of Mars, 22\u2019 54\u201c, as appears by comparing the nearby observations. The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 23\u2019 29\u201c. If the distance between the stars be divided by this, it comes out to 40\u2019 47\u201c of a day, or 16 hours 19 min. Therefore, the true opposition was 0h 39m PM on October 31. Mars\u2019s position was 17\u00b0 31\u2019 40\u201c Taurus. This needs no reduction to the orbit, as it is nearly at the node. The latitude was about 0\u00b0 8\u2019 north. But comparison with the preceding and following days shows a latitude of about 5\u2019 north.\nIX. Let, at any rate, Mars\u2019s position on 1597 December 10 at 8h 30m be 3\u00b0 45\u00bd\u2019 Cancer (as above) ^20. The sun\u2019s position was 29\u00b0 4\u2019 53\u201c Sagittarius. The distance between the stars was 4\u00b0 40\u2019 37\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 61\u2019 20\u201c, that of Mars 23\u2019 40\u201c (for in 1580 the diurnal motion in Gemini was 23\u2019, and in 1582, at 17\u00b0 Cancer, it was 24\u2019). Therefore, the sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 25\u2019 0\u201c. These data show that the time of true opposition followed 3 days 7 hours 14 min. later, on December 14 at 3h 44m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 2\u00b0 27\u2153\u2019 Cancer. The reduction to the orbit (quite ridiculous here, since the observation itself has an uncertainty of several minutes) requires the addition of about 52\u201c. Therefore, the corrected position was 2\u00b0 28\u2019 Cancer. The latitude, from the table, was 3\u00b0 33\u2019 north.\nOn the same night, the one following December 10, at 12\u2159h, Fabricius in East Frisia found Mars\u2019s position to be 3\u00b0 40\u00bc\u2019 Cancer with latitude 3\u00b0 23\u2019 N. In this observation the longitude comes out nearly the same. For the motion over 3h 40m is 3\u00bd\u2019, so that in the Brahean observation too, at 12\u2159h Mars could have been at 3\u00b0 42\u2019 Cancer\u2014two minutes beyond the Fabrician position.\nX. On 1600 January 13\/23 at 11h 40m, the time being adjusted to Uraniborg time, the planet was observed at 10\u00b0 38\u2019 46\u201c Leo ^21. The sun\u2019s position was 3\u00b0 26\u2019 30\u201c Aquarius. The stars were 7\u00b0 12\u2019 16\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion for the next few days was 1\u00b0 1\u2019 3\u201c; that of Mars, 23\u2019 44\u201c. The sum: 1\u00b0 24\u2019 47\u201c. The opposition therefore followed 5 days 2h 22m after; that is, on January 19\/29 at 2h 2m in the morning, before dawn. Mars was at 8\u00b0 38\u2019 Leo. There is no need for reduction, since it is near the limit. The latitude, from the table, was 4\u00b0 30\u2019 50\u201c N.\nXI. On the evening of 1602 Febr. 18\/28 at 10h 30m, using the Tychonic  instruments (with the help of the learned Matthias Seiffard,22 bequeathed us by Tycho), I took the distance of Mars from the middle star of the tail of Ursa Major 23 to be 52\u00b0 22\u2019. And since the distance between Cor Leonis and Procyon was 37\u00b0 22\u2019 20\u201c, which should have been 37\u00b0 19\u2019 50\u201c,24 we know that the sextant reads 2\u00bd minutes high. Therefore, the corrected distance of Mars from the tail of Ursa was 52\u00b0 19\u00bd\u2019. And since the latitude of the fixed star is 56\u00b0 22\u2019, the remainder, by subtraction, is 4\u00b0 2\u00bd\u2019\u2014supposing that Mars was at precisely the same longitude as the fixed star. But because there was a difference of 3\u00be degrees between them (as is clear from the following observations), a slight correction is required.\n For let AB be 3\u00b0 43\u2019 30\u201c on a parallel close to the ecliptic, B Mars, C the fixed star, and BC 52\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c. Dividing the secant of BC by the secant of AB gives the  secant of CA, 52\u00b0 14\u2019, which, subtracted from 56\u00b0 22\u2019 (the latitude of the fixed star) leaves 4\u00b0 8\u2019 north as Mars\u2019s observed latitude. At the same time, we found 19\u00b0 23\u2019 between Mars and Cor Leonis (19\u00b0 20\u00bd corrected), and 21\u00b0 20\u2019 between Mars and the bright star in the wing of Virgo25 (21\u00b0 17\u00bd\u2019 corrected). From these two distances (using the latitudes of the stars and Mars), Mars\u2019s longitude is found to be 13\u00b0 19\u2019 6\u201c Virgo, by consensus of all measurements.\nAlternatively, the meridian altitude of Mars was found at 12h 40m, using two quadrants, to be 50\u00b0 19\u2019, while the tail of Leo26 was 56\u00b0 45\u2019. Therefore, from the declinations and right ascensions of the fixed stars and our distances, Mars\u2019s position is determined as 13\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c Virgo, latitude 4\u00b0 7\u2019 55\u201c ^27. This is the Tychonic procedure. I have included the other for the sake of showing a consensus, and also that it might be evident that despite the lack of absolute perfection in the demonstration, short cuts either in computation or in our understanding can under certain circumstances be applied. For in that previous procedure there is less in the actual work than in the reporting of it. At Prague, 5\u00b0 Scorpio was rising ^28. Therefore, the nonagesimal was about 32\u00bd\u00b0 from the zenith. And since Mars\u2019s distance from the earth was rather more than half the sun\u2019s distance, the resulting parallax of about 5\u2019 opposite 32\u00bd\u00b0 in our parallactic table, shows a latitudinal parallax of 2\u2019 41\u201c. Thus the latitude as seen from the middle of the earth would be 4\u00b0 10\u2154\u2019 north. And because the altitude of the nonagesimal was 57\u00bd\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax at the horizon was 4\u2019 13\u201c. But since Mars was 38\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, the longitudinal parallax corresponding to this position is 2\u2019 36\u201c, and if this be eliminated, Mars would be placed at about 13\u00b0 18\u2019 Virgo ^29. At that moment, the sun\u2019s position was 10\u00b0 16\u2019 42\u201c Pisces. The distance between the bodies was 3\u00b0 1\u2019 18\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 4\u201c, and that of Mars, 24\u2019 5\u201c (for it was 24\u2019 18\u201c at 21\u00b0 Leo in 1585, and 24\u2019 at 26 Virgo in 1587). The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 24\u2019 9\u201c. The true opposition therefore followed 2 days 3 hours 43 minutes later, on 21 February\/3 March before dawn at 2h 13m, Mars being at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 35\u201c Virgo. Forty seconds must be subtracted to reduce the position to the orbit, putting Mars at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 Virgo, with slightly less latitude than before, since the latitude was then decreasing. It was therefore about 4\u00b0 10\u2019, or 4\u00b0 7\u2153\u2019 if the parallax be neglected.\n But because, since Tycho\u2019s death, we have not made frequent observations nor continued them over several days, it would be best, for certainty\u2019s sake, also to make use of those observations which David Fabricius of East Frisia, a sedulous practitioner of astronomy, has communicated to me.\nOn February 16, old style, at 5h in the morning, he took the planet\u2019s distances from the tail of Leo (for the latitude), from the neck of Leo,30 and, on the other hand, from the bright star in the southern wing of Virgo, so as to check its longitude by working it out twice.\nI could make use of Tycho\u2019s line of reasoning, which he routinely adopted in volume I of the Progymnasmata when (as here) the declination of the planet was not known. But because that method extends to ten operations, I prefer for the sake of brevity to proceed as I did before with my own observations. Here there are no hidden dangers.\nFirst, the star in the wing of Virgo, adjusted to our time, is at 4\u00b0 36\u2019 30\u201c Libra with latitude 2\u00b0 50\u2019 north. Fabricius found that Mars is 20\u00b0 18\u2019 westward from it on the zodiac, which puts Mars at about 14\u00b0 18\u2019 30\u201c Virgo. This is a preliminary, approximate figure: the longitude will shortly be corrected. Now the tail of Leo31 is at 16\u00b0 4\u2019 Virgo, with latitude 12\u00b0 18\u2019 North, and Mars was found to be 8\u00b0 17\u2019 distant from the Tail. What is sought is the distance of its parallel from the Tail, since the difference in longitude is 1\u00b0 45\u2019. Dividing the secant of 8\u00b0 17\u2019 by the secant of 1\u00b0 45\u2019 gives the secant of 8\u00b0 6\u2019, the arc sought. This subtracted from the fixed star\u2019s northern latitude of 12\u00b0 18\u2019 leaves Mars\u2019s latitude, 4\u00b0 12\u2019 north. This I now take as determined, and compare it with the latitudes of the fixed stars according to the laws of trigonometry. From the Wing of Virgo, I find Mars\u2019s longitude to be 14\u00b0 19\u2019 Virgo; from the Neck of Leo, 14\u00b0 23\u2019 36\u201c. The mean of these two is 14\u00b0 21\u2019 18\u201c Virgo. And since the sextant gave distances larger than the truth, the latitude would come out at 4\u00b0 14\u2019 north.\nOn the night following February 23, at 12h, he observed Mars in relation to five fixed stars: the Tail of Leo and Arcturus for latitude, and for the longitude, in the first instance, Spica (which followed it), and, in the second, the Neck of Leo and Cor Leonis (which preceded it).\nBy a rough estimate, I foresee that Mars is going to fall at 11\u00bc\u00b0 Virgo. It was found to be 9\u00b0 24\u2019 from the Tail of Leo, and hence, its latitude comes out at 4\u00b0 6\u2019 ^32. And now, through this and the latitudes of the fixed stars, together with their distances (17\u00b0 26\u2019 from Regulus, 17\u00b0 51\u2019 from the Neck of Leo, 37\u00b0 28\u2019 from Spica, 44\u00b0 15\u2019 from Arcturus), Mars\u2019s position comes out at 11\u00b0 21\u2019 23\u201c Virgo (from Regulus), 11\u00b0 20\u2019 52\u201c Virgo (from the Neck of Leo), and 11\u00b0 17\u2019 40\u201c (from Spica). Again (as you see) the distances err in being too great. For from the Heart and the Neck [of Leo], Mars is pushed a little eastward, and from Spica and Arcturus a little westward, and more from Arcturus, owing to its greater northern latitude ^33. The mean (ignoring Arcturus), 11\u00b0 19\u2019 20\u201c Virgo, is very nearly true. Also, the latitude is greater, namely, 4\u00b0 7\u2019 40\u201c north. Now from February 15 at 17h to 23 February at 12h, a period of 7 days 19 hours, Mars moved 3\u00b0 0\u2019: 180 minutes in 187 hours. That is, about one minute per hour. And if you wish to take it into account, the parallax (if any) is subtracted from the longitude on February 16 and a little is added on February 23.\n Because the last observation follows the time of observation found by me by 2 days 21 hours 47 min., add the motion corresponding to this time, 1\u00b0 7\u2019: the position will come out 12\u00b0 26\u2019 Virgo. The agreement is thus very good\u2014it could not be better\u2014given that both of us [that is, Kepler and Fabricius] work independently and do not rely on the facilities used by Tycho Brahe.","1716":"VIII. On 1595 October 30 at 8h 20m, the planet was found at 17\u00b0 47\u2019 15\u201c Taurus,19 not far from the nonagesimal. We may thus be sure of the parallax, although we must take it into account. The latitude was 0\u00b0 5\u2019 10\u201c north. The sun\u2019s position was 16\u00b0 50\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio. The distance between the stars was 56\u2019 45\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 35\u201c; that of Mars, 22\u2019 54\u201c, as appears by comparing the nearby observations. The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 23\u2019 29\u201c. If the distance between the stars be divided by this, it comes out to 40\u2019 47\u201c of a day, or 16 hours 19 min. Therefore, the true opposition was 0h 39m PM on October 31. Mars\u2019s position was 17\u00b0 31\u2019 40\u201c Taurus. This needs no reduction to the orbit, as it is nearly at the node. The latitude was about 0\u00b0 8\u2019 north. But comparison with the preceding and following days shows a latitude of about 5\u2019 north.\nIX. Let, at any rate, Mars\u2019s position on 1597 December 10 at 8h 30m be 3\u00b0 45\u00bd\u2019 Cancer (as above) ^20. The sun\u2019s position was 29\u00b0 4\u2019 53\u201c Sagittarius. The distance between the stars was 4\u00b0 40\u2019 37\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 61\u2019 20\u201c, that of Mars 23\u2019 40\u201c (for in 1580 the diurnal motion in Gemini was 23\u2019, and in 1582, at 17\u00b0 Cancer, it was 24\u2019). Therefore, the sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 25\u2019 0\u201c. These data show that the time of true opposition followed 3 days 7 hours 14 min. later, on December 14 at 3h 44m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 2\u00b0 27\u2153\u2019 Cancer. The reduction to the orbit (quite ridiculous here, since the observation itself has an uncertainty of several minutes) requires the addition of about 52\u201c. Therefore, the corrected position was 2\u00b0 28\u2019 Cancer. The latitude, from the table, was 3\u00b0 33\u2019 north.\nOn the same night, the one following December 10, at 12\u2159h, Fabricius in East Frisia found Mars\u2019s position to be 3\u00b0 40\u00bc\u2019 Cancer with latitude 3\u00b0 23\u2019 N. In this observation the longitude comes out nearly the same. For the motion over 3h 40m is 3\u00bd\u2019, so that in the Brahean observation too, at 12\u2159h Mars could have been at 3\u00b0 42\u2019 Cancer\u2014two minutes beyond the Fabrician position.\nX. On 1600 January 13\/23 at 11h 40m, the time being adjusted to Uraniborg time, the planet was observed at 10\u00b0 38\u2019 46\u201c Leo ^21. The sun\u2019s position was 3\u00b0 26\u2019 30\u201c Aquarius. The stars were 7\u00b0 12\u2019 16\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion for the next few days was 1\u00b0 1\u2019 3\u201c; that of Mars, 23\u2019 44\u201c. The sum: 1\u00b0 24\u2019 47\u201c. The opposition therefore followed 5 days 2h 22m after; that is, on January 19\/29 at 2h 2m in the morning, before dawn. Mars was at 8\u00b0 38\u2019 Leo. There is no need for reduction, since it is near the limit. The latitude, from the table, was 4\u00b0 30\u2019 50\u201c N.\nXI. On the evening of 1602 Febr. 18\/28 at 10h 30m, using the Tychonic  instruments (with the help of the learned Matthias Seiffard,22 bequeathed us by Tycho), I took the distance of Mars from the middle star of the tail of Ursa Major 23 to be 52\u00b0 22\u2019. And since the distance between Cor Leonis and Procyon was 37\u00b0 22\u2019 20\u201c, which should have been 37\u00b0 19\u2019 50\u201c,24 we know that the sextant reads 2\u00bd minutes high. Therefore, the corrected distance of Mars from the tail of Ursa was 52\u00b0 19\u00bd\u2019. And since the latitude of the fixed star is 56\u00b0 22\u2019, the remainder, by subtraction, is 4\u00b0 2\u00bd\u2019\u2014supposing that Mars was at precisely the same longitude as the fixed star. But because there was a difference of 3\u00be degrees between them (as is clear from the following observations), a slight correction is required.\n For let AB be 3\u00b0 43\u2019 30\u201c on a parallel close to the ecliptic, B Mars, C the fixed star, and BC 52\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c. Dividing the secant of BC by the secant of AB gives the  secant of CA, 52\u00b0 14\u2019, which, subtracted from 56\u00b0 22\u2019 (the latitude of the fixed star) leaves 4\u00b0 8\u2019 north as Mars\u2019s observed latitude. At the same time, we found 19\u00b0 23\u2019 between Mars and Cor Leonis (19\u00b0 20\u00bd corrected), and 21\u00b0 20\u2019 between Mars and the bright star in the wing of Virgo25 (21\u00b0 17\u00bd\u2019 corrected). From these two distances (using the latitudes of the stars and Mars), Mars\u2019s longitude is found to be 13\u00b0 19\u2019 6\u201c Virgo, by consensus of all measurements.\nAlternatively, the meridian altitude of Mars was found at 12h 40m, using two quadrants, to be 50\u00b0 19\u2019, while the tail of Leo26 was 56\u00b0 45\u2019. Therefore, from the declinations and right ascensions of the fixed stars and our distances, Mars\u2019s position is determined as 13\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c Virgo, latitude 4\u00b0 7\u2019 55\u201c ^27. This is the Tychonic procedure. I have included the other for the sake of showing a consensus, and also that it might be evident that despite the lack of absolute perfection in the demonstration, short cuts either in computation or in our understanding can under certain circumstances be applied. For in that previous procedure there is less in the actual work than in the reporting of it. At Prague, 5\u00b0 Scorpio was rising ^28. Therefore, the nonagesimal was about 32\u00bd\u00b0 from the zenith. And since Mars\u2019s distance from the earth was rather more than half the sun\u2019s distance, the resulting parallax of about 5\u2019 opposite 32\u00bd\u00b0 in our parallactic table, shows a latitudinal parallax of 2\u2019 41\u201c. Thus the latitude as seen from the middle of the earth would be 4\u00b0 10\u2154\u2019 north. And because the altitude of the nonagesimal was 57\u00bd\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax at the horizon was 4\u2019 13\u201c. But since Mars was 38\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, the longitudinal parallax corresponding to this position is 2\u2019 36\u201c, and if this be eliminated, Mars would be placed at about 13\u00b0 18\u2019 Virgo ^29. At that moment, the sun\u2019s position was 10\u00b0 16\u2019 42\u201c Pisces. The distance between the bodies was 3\u00b0 1\u2019 18\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 4\u201c, and that of Mars, 24\u2019 5\u201c (for it was 24\u2019 18\u201c at 21\u00b0 Leo in 1585, and 24\u2019 at 26 Virgo in 1587). The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 24\u2019 9\u201c. The true opposition therefore followed 2 days 3 hours 43 minutes later, on 21 February\/3 March before dawn at 2h 13m, Mars being at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 35\u201c Virgo. Forty seconds must be subtracted to reduce the position to the orbit, putting Mars at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 Virgo, with slightly less latitude than before, since the latitude was then decreasing. It was therefore about 4\u00b0 10\u2019, or 4\u00b0 7\u2153\u2019 if the parallax be neglected.\n But because, since Tycho\u2019s death, we have not made frequent observations nor continued them over several days, it would be best, for certainty\u2019s sake, also to make use of those observations which David Fabricius of East Frisia, a sedulous practitioner of astronomy, has communicated to me.\nOn February 16, old style, at 5h in the morning, he took the planet\u2019s distances from the tail of Leo (for the latitude), from the neck of Leo,30 and, on the other hand, from the bright star in the southern wing of Virgo, so as to check its longitude by working it out twice.\nI could make use of Tycho\u2019s line of reasoning, which he routinely adopted in volume I of the Progymnasmata when (as here) the declination of the planet was not known. But because that method extends to ten operations, I prefer for the sake of brevity to proceed as I did before with my own observations. Here there are no hidden dangers.\nFirst, the star in the wing of Virgo, adjusted to our time, is at 4\u00b0 36\u2019 30\u201c Libra with latitude 2\u00b0 50\u2019 north. Fabricius found that Mars is 20\u00b0 18\u2019 westward from it on the zodiac, which puts Mars at about 14\u00b0 18\u2019 30\u201c Virgo. This is a preliminary, approximate figure: the longitude will shortly be corrected. Now the tail of Leo31 is at 16\u00b0 4\u2019 Virgo, with latitude 12\u00b0 18\u2019 North, and Mars was found to be 8\u00b0 17\u2019 distant from the Tail. What is sought is the distance of its parallel from the Tail, since the difference in longitude is 1\u00b0 45\u2019. Dividing the secant of 8\u00b0 17\u2019 by the secant of 1\u00b0 45\u2019 gives the secant of 8\u00b0 6\u2019, the arc sought. This subtracted from the fixed star\u2019s northern latitude of 12\u00b0 18\u2019 leaves Mars\u2019s latitude, 4\u00b0 12\u2019 north. This I now take as determined, and compare it with the latitudes of the fixed stars according to the laws of trigonometry. From the Wing of Virgo, I find Mars\u2019s longitude to be 14\u00b0 19\u2019 Virgo; from the Neck of Leo, 14\u00b0 23\u2019 36\u201c. The mean of these two is 14\u00b0 21\u2019 18\u201c Virgo. And since the sextant gave distances larger than the truth, the latitude would come out at 4\u00b0 14\u2019 north.\nOn the night following February 23, at 12h, he observed Mars in relation to five fixed stars: the Tail of Leo and Arcturus for latitude, and for the longitude, in the first instance, Spica (which followed it), and, in the second, the Neck of Leo and Cor Leonis (which preceded it).\nBy a rough estimate, I foresee that Mars is going to fall at 11\u00bc\u00b0 Virgo. It was found to be 9\u00b0 24\u2019 from the Tail of Leo, and hence, its latitude comes out at 4\u00b0 6\u2019 ^32. And now, through this and the latitudes of the fixed stars, together with their distances (17\u00b0 26\u2019 from Regulus, 17\u00b0 51\u2019 from the Neck of Leo, 37\u00b0 28\u2019 from Spica, 44\u00b0 15\u2019 from Arcturus), Mars\u2019s position comes out at 11\u00b0 21\u2019 23\u201c Virgo (from Regulus), 11\u00b0 20\u2019 52\u201c Virgo (from the Neck of Leo), and 11\u00b0 17\u2019 40\u201c (from Spica). Again (as you see) the distances err in being too great. For from the Heart and the Neck [of Leo], Mars is pushed a little eastward, and from Spica and Arcturus a little westward, and more from Arcturus, owing to its greater northern latitude ^33. The mean (ignoring Arcturus), 11\u00b0 19\u2019 20\u201c Virgo, is very nearly true. Also, the latitude is greater, namely, 4\u00b0 7\u2019 40\u201c north. Now from February 15 at 17h to 23 February at 12h, a period of 7 days 19 hours, Mars moved 3\u00b0 0\u2019: 180 minutes in 187 hours. That is, about one minute per hour. And if you wish to take it into account, the parallax (if any) is subtracted from the longitude on February 16 and a little is added on February 23.\n Because the last observation follows the time of observation found by me by 2 days 21 hours 47 min., add the motion corresponding to this time, 1\u00b0 7\u2019: the position will come out 12\u00b0 26\u2019 Virgo. The agreement is thus very good\u2014it could not be better\u2014given that both of us [that is, Kepler and Fabricius] work independently and do not rely on the facilities used by Tycho Brahe.","1717":"VIII. On 1595 October 30 at 8h 20m, the planet was found at 17\u00b0 47\u2019 15\u201c Taurus,19 not far from the nonagesimal. We may thus be sure of the parallax, although we must take it into account. The latitude was 0\u00b0 5\u2019 10\u201c north. The sun\u2019s position was 16\u00b0 50\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio. The distance between the stars was 56\u2019 45\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 35\u201c; that of Mars, 22\u2019 54\u201c, as appears by comparing the nearby observations. The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 23\u2019 29\u201c. If the distance between the stars be divided by this, it comes out to 40\u2019 47\u201c of a day, or 16 hours 19 min. Therefore, the true opposition was 0h 39m PM on October 31. Mars\u2019s position was 17\u00b0 31\u2019 40\u201c Taurus. This needs no reduction to the orbit, as it is nearly at the node. The latitude was about 0\u00b0 8\u2019 north. But comparison with the preceding and following days shows a latitude of about 5\u2019 north.\nIX. Let, at any rate, Mars\u2019s position on 1597 December 10 at 8h 30m be 3\u00b0 45\u00bd\u2019 Cancer (as above) ^20. The sun\u2019s position was 29\u00b0 4\u2019 53\u201c Sagittarius. The distance between the stars was 4\u00b0 40\u2019 37\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 61\u2019 20\u201c, that of Mars 23\u2019 40\u201c (for in 1580 the diurnal motion in Gemini was 23\u2019, and in 1582, at 17\u00b0 Cancer, it was 24\u2019). Therefore, the sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 25\u2019 0\u201c. These data show that the time of true opposition followed 3 days 7 hours 14 min. later, on December 14 at 3h 44m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 2\u00b0 27\u2153\u2019 Cancer. The reduction to the orbit (quite ridiculous here, since the observation itself has an uncertainty of several minutes) requires the addition of about 52\u201c. Therefore, the corrected position was 2\u00b0 28\u2019 Cancer. The latitude, from the table, was 3\u00b0 33\u2019 north.\nOn the same night, the one following December 10, at 12\u2159h, Fabricius in East Frisia found Mars\u2019s position to be 3\u00b0 40\u00bc\u2019 Cancer with latitude 3\u00b0 23\u2019 N. In this observation the longitude comes out nearly the same. For the motion over 3h 40m is 3\u00bd\u2019, so that in the Brahean observation too, at 12\u2159h Mars could have been at 3\u00b0 42\u2019 Cancer\u2014two minutes beyond the Fabrician position.\nX. On 1600 January 13\/23 at 11h 40m, the time being adjusted to Uraniborg time, the planet was observed at 10\u00b0 38\u2019 46\u201c Leo ^21. The sun\u2019s position was 3\u00b0 26\u2019 30\u201c Aquarius. The stars were 7\u00b0 12\u2019 16\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion for the next few days was 1\u00b0 1\u2019 3\u201c; that of Mars, 23\u2019 44\u201c. The sum: 1\u00b0 24\u2019 47\u201c. The opposition therefore followed 5 days 2h 22m after; that is, on January 19\/29 at 2h 2m in the morning, before dawn. Mars was at 8\u00b0 38\u2019 Leo. There is no need for reduction, since it is near the limit. The latitude, from the table, was 4\u00b0 30\u2019 50\u201c N.\nXI. On the evening of 1602 Febr. 18\/28 at 10h 30m, using the Tychonic  instruments (with the help of the learned Matthias Seiffard,22 bequeathed us by Tycho), I took the distance of Mars from the middle star of the tail of Ursa Major 23 to be 52\u00b0 22\u2019. And since the distance between Cor Leonis and Procyon was 37\u00b0 22\u2019 20\u201c, which should have been 37\u00b0 19\u2019 50\u201c,24 we know that the sextant reads 2\u00bd minutes high. Therefore, the corrected distance of Mars from the tail of Ursa was 52\u00b0 19\u00bd\u2019. And since the latitude of the fixed star is 56\u00b0 22\u2019, the remainder, by subtraction, is 4\u00b0 2\u00bd\u2019\u2014supposing that Mars was at precisely the same longitude as the fixed star. But because there was a difference of 3\u00be degrees between them (as is clear from the following observations), a slight correction is required.\n For let AB be 3\u00b0 43\u2019 30\u201c on a parallel close to the ecliptic, B Mars, C the fixed star, and BC 52\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c. Dividing the secant of BC by the secant of AB gives the  secant of CA, 52\u00b0 14\u2019, which, subtracted from 56\u00b0 22\u2019 (the latitude of the fixed star) leaves 4\u00b0 8\u2019 north as Mars\u2019s observed latitude. At the same time, we found 19\u00b0 23\u2019 between Mars and Cor Leonis (19\u00b0 20\u00bd corrected), and 21\u00b0 20\u2019 between Mars and the bright star in the wing of Virgo25 (21\u00b0 17\u00bd\u2019 corrected). From these two distances (using the latitudes of the stars and Mars), Mars\u2019s longitude is found to be 13\u00b0 19\u2019 6\u201c Virgo, by consensus of all measurements.\nAlternatively, the meridian altitude of Mars was found at 12h 40m, using two quadrants, to be 50\u00b0 19\u2019, while the tail of Leo26 was 56\u00b0 45\u2019. Therefore, from the declinations and right ascensions of the fixed stars and our distances, Mars\u2019s position is determined as 13\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c Virgo, latitude 4\u00b0 7\u2019 55\u201c ^27. This is the Tychonic procedure. I have included the other for the sake of showing a consensus, and also that it might be evident that despite the lack of absolute perfection in the demonstration, short cuts either in computation or in our understanding can under certain circumstances be applied. For in that previous procedure there is less in the actual work than in the reporting of it. At Prague, 5\u00b0 Scorpio was rising ^28. Therefore, the nonagesimal was about 32\u00bd\u00b0 from the zenith. And since Mars\u2019s distance from the earth was rather more than half the sun\u2019s distance, the resulting parallax of about 5\u2019 opposite 32\u00bd\u00b0 in our parallactic table, shows a latitudinal parallax of 2\u2019 41\u201c. Thus the latitude as seen from the middle of the earth would be 4\u00b0 10\u2154\u2019 north. And because the altitude of the nonagesimal was 57\u00bd\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax at the horizon was 4\u2019 13\u201c. But since Mars was 38\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, the longitudinal parallax corresponding to this position is 2\u2019 36\u201c, and if this be eliminated, Mars would be placed at about 13\u00b0 18\u2019 Virgo ^29. At that moment, the sun\u2019s position was 10\u00b0 16\u2019 42\u201c Pisces. The distance between the bodies was 3\u00b0 1\u2019 18\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 4\u201c, and that of Mars, 24\u2019 5\u201c (for it was 24\u2019 18\u201c at 21\u00b0 Leo in 1585, and 24\u2019 at 26 Virgo in 1587). The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 24\u2019 9\u201c. The true opposition therefore followed 2 days 3 hours 43 minutes later, on 21 February\/3 March before dawn at 2h 13m, Mars being at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 35\u201c Virgo. Forty seconds must be subtracted to reduce the position to the orbit, putting Mars at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 Virgo, with slightly less latitude than before, since the latitude was then decreasing. It was therefore about 4\u00b0 10\u2019, or 4\u00b0 7\u2153\u2019 if the parallax be neglected.\n But because, since Tycho\u2019s death, we have not made frequent observations nor continued them over several days, it would be best, for certainty\u2019s sake, also to make use of those observations which David Fabricius of East Frisia, a sedulous practitioner of astronomy, has communicated to me.\nOn February 16, old style, at 5h in the morning, he took the planet\u2019s distances from the tail of Leo (for the latitude), from the neck of Leo,30 and, on the other hand, from the bright star in the southern wing of Virgo, so as to check its longitude by working it out twice.\nI could make use of Tycho\u2019s line of reasoning, which he routinely adopted in volume I of the Progymnasmata when (as here) the declination of the planet was not known. But because that method extends to ten operations, I prefer for the sake of brevity to proceed as I did before with my own observations. Here there are no hidden dangers.\nFirst, the star in the wing of Virgo, adjusted to our time, is at 4\u00b0 36\u2019 30\u201c Libra with latitude 2\u00b0 50\u2019 north. Fabricius found that Mars is 20\u00b0 18\u2019 westward from it on the zodiac, which puts Mars at about 14\u00b0 18\u2019 30\u201c Virgo. This is a preliminary, approximate figure: the longitude will shortly be corrected. Now the tail of Leo31 is at 16\u00b0 4\u2019 Virgo, with latitude 12\u00b0 18\u2019 North, and Mars was found to be 8\u00b0 17\u2019 distant from the Tail. What is sought is the distance of its parallel from the Tail, since the difference in longitude is 1\u00b0 45\u2019. Dividing the secant of 8\u00b0 17\u2019 by the secant of 1\u00b0 45\u2019 gives the secant of 8\u00b0 6\u2019, the arc sought. This subtracted from the fixed star\u2019s northern latitude of 12\u00b0 18\u2019 leaves Mars\u2019s latitude, 4\u00b0 12\u2019 north. This I now take as determined, and compare it with the latitudes of the fixed stars according to the laws of trigonometry. From the Wing of Virgo, I find Mars\u2019s longitude to be 14\u00b0 19\u2019 Virgo; from the Neck of Leo, 14\u00b0 23\u2019 36\u201c. The mean of these two is 14\u00b0 21\u2019 18\u201c Virgo. And since the sextant gave distances larger than the truth, the latitude would come out at 4\u00b0 14\u2019 north.\nOn the night following February 23, at 12h, he observed Mars in relation to five fixed stars: the Tail of Leo and Arcturus for latitude, and for the longitude, in the first instance, Spica (which followed it), and, in the second, the Neck of Leo and Cor Leonis (which preceded it).\nBy a rough estimate, I foresee that Mars is going to fall at 11\u00bc\u00b0 Virgo. It was found to be 9\u00b0 24\u2019 from the Tail of Leo, and hence, its latitude comes out at 4\u00b0 6\u2019 ^32. And now, through this and the latitudes of the fixed stars, together with their distances (17\u00b0 26\u2019 from Regulus, 17\u00b0 51\u2019 from the Neck of Leo, 37\u00b0 28\u2019 from Spica, 44\u00b0 15\u2019 from Arcturus), Mars\u2019s position comes out at 11\u00b0 21\u2019 23\u201c Virgo (from Regulus), 11\u00b0 20\u2019 52\u201c Virgo (from the Neck of Leo), and 11\u00b0 17\u2019 40\u201c (from Spica). Again (as you see) the distances err in being too great. For from the Heart and the Neck [of Leo], Mars is pushed a little eastward, and from Spica and Arcturus a little westward, and more from Arcturus, owing to its greater northern latitude ^33. The mean (ignoring Arcturus), 11\u00b0 19\u2019 20\u201c Virgo, is very nearly true. Also, the latitude is greater, namely, 4\u00b0 7\u2019 40\u201c north. Now from February 15 at 17h to 23 February at 12h, a period of 7 days 19 hours, Mars moved 3\u00b0 0\u2019: 180 minutes in 187 hours. That is, about one minute per hour. And if you wish to take it into account, the parallax (if any) is subtracted from the longitude on February 16 and a little is added on February 23.\n Because the last observation follows the time of observation found by me by 2 days 21 hours 47 min., add the motion corresponding to this time, 1\u00b0 7\u2019: the position will come out 12\u00b0 26\u2019 Virgo. The agreement is thus very good\u2014it could not be better\u2014given that both of us [that is, Kepler and Fabricius] work independently and do not rely on the facilities used by Tycho Brahe.","1718":"VIII. On 1595 October 30 at 8h 20m, the planet was found at 17\u00b0 47\u2019 15\u201c Taurus,19 not far from the nonagesimal. We may thus be sure of the parallax, although we must take it into account. The latitude was 0\u00b0 5\u2019 10\u201c north. The sun\u2019s position was 16\u00b0 50\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio. The distance between the stars was 56\u2019 45\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 35\u201c; that of Mars, 22\u2019 54\u201c, as appears by comparing the nearby observations. The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 23\u2019 29\u201c. If the distance between the stars be divided by this, it comes out to 40\u2019 47\u201c of a day, or 16 hours 19 min. Therefore, the true opposition was 0h 39m PM on October 31. Mars\u2019s position was 17\u00b0 31\u2019 40\u201c Taurus. This needs no reduction to the orbit, as it is nearly at the node. The latitude was about 0\u00b0 8\u2019 north. But comparison with the preceding and following days shows a latitude of about 5\u2019 north.\nIX. Let, at any rate, Mars\u2019s position on 1597 December 10 at 8h 30m be 3\u00b0 45\u00bd\u2019 Cancer (as above) ^20. The sun\u2019s position was 29\u00b0 4\u2019 53\u201c Sagittarius. The distance between the stars was 4\u00b0 40\u2019 37\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 61\u2019 20\u201c, that of Mars 23\u2019 40\u201c (for in 1580 the diurnal motion in Gemini was 23\u2019, and in 1582, at 17\u00b0 Cancer, it was 24\u2019). Therefore, the sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 25\u2019 0\u201c. These data show that the time of true opposition followed 3 days 7 hours 14 min. later, on December 14 at 3h 44m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 2\u00b0 27\u2153\u2019 Cancer. The reduction to the orbit (quite ridiculous here, since the observation itself has an uncertainty of several minutes) requires the addition of about 52\u201c. Therefore, the corrected position was 2\u00b0 28\u2019 Cancer. The latitude, from the table, was 3\u00b0 33\u2019 north.\nOn the same night, the one following December 10, at 12\u2159h, Fabricius in East Frisia found Mars\u2019s position to be 3\u00b0 40\u00bc\u2019 Cancer with latitude 3\u00b0 23\u2019 N. In this observation the longitude comes out nearly the same. For the motion over 3h 40m is 3\u00bd\u2019, so that in the Brahean observation too, at 12\u2159h Mars could have been at 3\u00b0 42\u2019 Cancer\u2014two minutes beyond the Fabrician position.\nX. On 1600 January 13\/23 at 11h 40m, the time being adjusted to Uraniborg time, the planet was observed at 10\u00b0 38\u2019 46\u201c Leo ^21. The sun\u2019s position was 3\u00b0 26\u2019 30\u201c Aquarius. The stars were 7\u00b0 12\u2019 16\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion for the next few days was 1\u00b0 1\u2019 3\u201c; that of Mars, 23\u2019 44\u201c. The sum: 1\u00b0 24\u2019 47\u201c. The opposition therefore followed 5 days 2h 22m after; that is, on January 19\/29 at 2h 2m in the morning, before dawn. Mars was at 8\u00b0 38\u2019 Leo. There is no need for reduction, since it is near the limit. The latitude, from the table, was 4\u00b0 30\u2019 50\u201c N.\nXI. On the evening of 1602 Febr. 18\/28 at 10h 30m, using the Tychonic  instruments (with the help of the learned Matthias Seiffard,22 bequeathed us by Tycho), I took the distance of Mars from the middle star of the tail of Ursa Major 23 to be 52\u00b0 22\u2019. And since the distance between Cor Leonis and Procyon was 37\u00b0 22\u2019 20\u201c, which should have been 37\u00b0 19\u2019 50\u201c,24 we know that the sextant reads 2\u00bd minutes high. Therefore, the corrected distance of Mars from the tail of Ursa was 52\u00b0 19\u00bd\u2019. And since the latitude of the fixed star is 56\u00b0 22\u2019, the remainder, by subtraction, is 4\u00b0 2\u00bd\u2019\u2014supposing that Mars was at precisely the same longitude as the fixed star. But because there was a difference of 3\u00be degrees between them (as is clear from the following observations), a slight correction is required.\n For let AB be 3\u00b0 43\u2019 30\u201c on a parallel close to the ecliptic, B Mars, C the fixed star, and BC 52\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c. Dividing the secant of BC by the secant of AB gives the  secant of CA, 52\u00b0 14\u2019, which, subtracted from 56\u00b0 22\u2019 (the latitude of the fixed star) leaves 4\u00b0 8\u2019 north as Mars\u2019s observed latitude. At the same time, we found 19\u00b0 23\u2019 between Mars and Cor Leonis (19\u00b0 20\u00bd corrected), and 21\u00b0 20\u2019 between Mars and the bright star in the wing of Virgo25 (21\u00b0 17\u00bd\u2019 corrected). From these two distances (using the latitudes of the stars and Mars), Mars\u2019s longitude is found to be 13\u00b0 19\u2019 6\u201c Virgo, by consensus of all measurements.\nAlternatively, the meridian altitude of Mars was found at 12h 40m, using two quadrants, to be 50\u00b0 19\u2019, while the tail of Leo26 was 56\u00b0 45\u2019. Therefore, from the declinations and right ascensions of the fixed stars and our distances, Mars\u2019s position is determined as 13\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c Virgo, latitude 4\u00b0 7\u2019 55\u201c ^27. This is the Tychonic procedure. I have included the other for the sake of showing a consensus, and also that it might be evident that despite the lack of absolute perfection in the demonstration, short cuts either in computation or in our understanding can under certain circumstances be applied. For in that previous procedure there is less in the actual work than in the reporting of it. At Prague, 5\u00b0 Scorpio was rising ^28. Therefore, the nonagesimal was about 32\u00bd\u00b0 from the zenith. And since Mars\u2019s distance from the earth was rather more than half the sun\u2019s distance, the resulting parallax of about 5\u2019 opposite 32\u00bd\u00b0 in our parallactic table, shows a latitudinal parallax of 2\u2019 41\u201c. Thus the latitude as seen from the middle of the earth would be 4\u00b0 10\u2154\u2019 north. And because the altitude of the nonagesimal was 57\u00bd\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax at the horizon was 4\u2019 13\u201c. But since Mars was 38\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, the longitudinal parallax corresponding to this position is 2\u2019 36\u201c, and if this be eliminated, Mars would be placed at about 13\u00b0 18\u2019 Virgo ^29. At that moment, the sun\u2019s position was 10\u00b0 16\u2019 42\u201c Pisces. The distance between the bodies was 3\u00b0 1\u2019 18\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 4\u201c, and that of Mars, 24\u2019 5\u201c (for it was 24\u2019 18\u201c at 21\u00b0 Leo in 1585, and 24\u2019 at 26 Virgo in 1587). The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 24\u2019 9\u201c. The true opposition therefore followed 2 days 3 hours 43 minutes later, on 21 February\/3 March before dawn at 2h 13m, Mars being at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 35\u201c Virgo. Forty seconds must be subtracted to reduce the position to the orbit, putting Mars at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 Virgo, with slightly less latitude than before, since the latitude was then decreasing. It was therefore about 4\u00b0 10\u2019, or 4\u00b0 7\u2153\u2019 if the parallax be neglected.\n But because, since Tycho\u2019s death, we have not made frequent observations nor continued them over several days, it would be best, for certainty\u2019s sake, also to make use of those observations which David Fabricius of East Frisia, a sedulous practitioner of astronomy, has communicated to me.\nOn February 16, old style, at 5h in the morning, he took the planet\u2019s distances from the tail of Leo (for the latitude), from the neck of Leo,30 and, on the other hand, from the bright star in the southern wing of Virgo, so as to check its longitude by working it out twice.\nI could make use of Tycho\u2019s line of reasoning, which he routinely adopted in volume I of the Progymnasmata when (as here) the declination of the planet was not known. But because that method extends to ten operations, I prefer for the sake of brevity to proceed as I did before with my own observations. Here there are no hidden dangers.\nFirst, the star in the wing of Virgo, adjusted to our time, is at 4\u00b0 36\u2019 30\u201c Libra with latitude 2\u00b0 50\u2019 north. Fabricius found that Mars is 20\u00b0 18\u2019 westward from it on the zodiac, which puts Mars at about 14\u00b0 18\u2019 30\u201c Virgo. This is a preliminary, approximate figure: the longitude will shortly be corrected. Now the tail of Leo31 is at 16\u00b0 4\u2019 Virgo, with latitude 12\u00b0 18\u2019 North, and Mars was found to be 8\u00b0 17\u2019 distant from the Tail. What is sought is the distance of its parallel from the Tail, since the difference in longitude is 1\u00b0 45\u2019. Dividing the secant of 8\u00b0 17\u2019 by the secant of 1\u00b0 45\u2019 gives the secant of 8\u00b0 6\u2019, the arc sought. This subtracted from the fixed star\u2019s northern latitude of 12\u00b0 18\u2019 leaves Mars\u2019s latitude, 4\u00b0 12\u2019 north. This I now take as determined, and compare it with the latitudes of the fixed stars according to the laws of trigonometry. From the Wing of Virgo, I find Mars\u2019s longitude to be 14\u00b0 19\u2019 Virgo; from the Neck of Leo, 14\u00b0 23\u2019 36\u201c. The mean of these two is 14\u00b0 21\u2019 18\u201c Virgo. And since the sextant gave distances larger than the truth, the latitude would come out at 4\u00b0 14\u2019 north.\nOn the night following February 23, at 12h, he observed Mars in relation to five fixed stars: the Tail of Leo and Arcturus for latitude, and for the longitude, in the first instance, Spica (which followed it), and, in the second, the Neck of Leo and Cor Leonis (which preceded it).\nBy a rough estimate, I foresee that Mars is going to fall at 11\u00bc\u00b0 Virgo. It was found to be 9\u00b0 24\u2019 from the Tail of Leo, and hence, its latitude comes out at 4\u00b0 6\u2019 ^32. And now, through this and the latitudes of the fixed stars, together with their distances (17\u00b0 26\u2019 from Regulus, 17\u00b0 51\u2019 from the Neck of Leo, 37\u00b0 28\u2019 from Spica, 44\u00b0 15\u2019 from Arcturus), Mars\u2019s position comes out at 11\u00b0 21\u2019 23\u201c Virgo (from Regulus), 11\u00b0 20\u2019 52\u201c Virgo (from the Neck of Leo), and 11\u00b0 17\u2019 40\u201c (from Spica). Again (as you see) the distances err in being too great. For from the Heart and the Neck [of Leo], Mars is pushed a little eastward, and from Spica and Arcturus a little westward, and more from Arcturus, owing to its greater northern latitude ^33. The mean (ignoring Arcturus), 11\u00b0 19\u2019 20\u201c Virgo, is very nearly true. Also, the latitude is greater, namely, 4\u00b0 7\u2019 40\u201c north. Now from February 15 at 17h to 23 February at 12h, a period of 7 days 19 hours, Mars moved 3\u00b0 0\u2019: 180 minutes in 187 hours. That is, about one minute per hour. And if you wish to take it into account, the parallax (if any) is subtracted from the longitude on February 16 and a little is added on February 23.\n Because the last observation follows the time of observation found by me by 2 days 21 hours 47 min., add the motion corresponding to this time, 1\u00b0 7\u2019: the position will come out 12\u00b0 26\u2019 Virgo. The agreement is thus very good\u2014it could not be better\u2014given that both of us [that is, Kepler and Fabricius] work independently and do not rely on the facilities used by Tycho Brahe.","1719":"VIII. On 1595 October 30 at 8h 20m, the planet was found at 17\u00b0 47\u2019 15\u201c Taurus,19 not far from the nonagesimal. We may thus be sure of the parallax, although we must take it into account. The latitude was 0\u00b0 5\u2019 10\u201c north. The sun\u2019s position was 16\u00b0 50\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio. The distance between the stars was 56\u2019 45\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 35\u201c; that of Mars, 22\u2019 54\u201c, as appears by comparing the nearby observations. The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 23\u2019 29\u201c. If the distance between the stars be divided by this, it comes out to 40\u2019 47\u201c of a day, or 16 hours 19 min. Therefore, the true opposition was 0h 39m PM on October 31. Mars\u2019s position was 17\u00b0 31\u2019 40\u201c Taurus. This needs no reduction to the orbit, as it is nearly at the node. The latitude was about 0\u00b0 8\u2019 north. But comparison with the preceding and following days shows a latitude of about 5\u2019 north.\nIX. Let, at any rate, Mars\u2019s position on 1597 December 10 at 8h 30m be 3\u00b0 45\u00bd\u2019 Cancer (as above) ^20. The sun\u2019s position was 29\u00b0 4\u2019 53\u201c Sagittarius. The distance between the stars was 4\u00b0 40\u2019 37\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 61\u2019 20\u201c, that of Mars 23\u2019 40\u201c (for in 1580 the diurnal motion in Gemini was 23\u2019, and in 1582, at 17\u00b0 Cancer, it was 24\u2019). Therefore, the sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 25\u2019 0\u201c. These data show that the time of true opposition followed 3 days 7 hours 14 min. later, on December 14 at 3h 44m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 2\u00b0 27\u2153\u2019 Cancer. The reduction to the orbit (quite ridiculous here, since the observation itself has an uncertainty of several minutes) requires the addition of about 52\u201c. Therefore, the corrected position was 2\u00b0 28\u2019 Cancer. The latitude, from the table, was 3\u00b0 33\u2019 north.\nOn the same night, the one following December 10, at 12\u2159h, Fabricius in East Frisia found Mars\u2019s position to be 3\u00b0 40\u00bc\u2019 Cancer with latitude 3\u00b0 23\u2019 N. In this observation the longitude comes out nearly the same. For the motion over 3h 40m is 3\u00bd\u2019, so that in the Brahean observation too, at 12\u2159h Mars could have been at 3\u00b0 42\u2019 Cancer\u2014two minutes beyond the Fabrician position.\nX. On 1600 January 13\/23 at 11h 40m, the time being adjusted to Uraniborg time, the planet was observed at 10\u00b0 38\u2019 46\u201c Leo ^21. The sun\u2019s position was 3\u00b0 26\u2019 30\u201c Aquarius. The stars were 7\u00b0 12\u2019 16\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion for the next few days was 1\u00b0 1\u2019 3\u201c; that of Mars, 23\u2019 44\u201c. The sum: 1\u00b0 24\u2019 47\u201c. The opposition therefore followed 5 days 2h 22m after; that is, on January 19\/29 at 2h 2m in the morning, before dawn. Mars was at 8\u00b0 38\u2019 Leo. There is no need for reduction, since it is near the limit. The latitude, from the table, was 4\u00b0 30\u2019 50\u201c N.\nXI. On the evening of 1602 Febr. 18\/28 at 10h 30m, using the Tychonic  instruments (with the help of the learned Matthias Seiffard,22 bequeathed us by Tycho), I took the distance of Mars from the middle star of the tail of Ursa Major 23 to be 52\u00b0 22\u2019. And since the distance between Cor Leonis and Procyon was 37\u00b0 22\u2019 20\u201c, which should have been 37\u00b0 19\u2019 50\u201c,24 we know that the sextant reads 2\u00bd minutes high. Therefore, the corrected distance of Mars from the tail of Ursa was 52\u00b0 19\u00bd\u2019. And since the latitude of the fixed star is 56\u00b0 22\u2019, the remainder, by subtraction, is 4\u00b0 2\u00bd\u2019\u2014supposing that Mars was at precisely the same longitude as the fixed star. But because there was a difference of 3\u00be degrees between them (as is clear from the following observations), a slight correction is required.\n For let AB be 3\u00b0 43\u2019 30\u201c on a parallel close to the ecliptic, B Mars, C the fixed star, and BC 52\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c. Dividing the secant of BC by the secant of AB gives the  secant of CA, 52\u00b0 14\u2019, which, subtracted from 56\u00b0 22\u2019 (the latitude of the fixed star) leaves 4\u00b0 8\u2019 north as Mars\u2019s observed latitude. At the same time, we found 19\u00b0 23\u2019 between Mars and Cor Leonis (19\u00b0 20\u00bd corrected), and 21\u00b0 20\u2019 between Mars and the bright star in the wing of Virgo25 (21\u00b0 17\u00bd\u2019 corrected). From these two distances (using the latitudes of the stars and Mars), Mars\u2019s longitude is found to be 13\u00b0 19\u2019 6\u201c Virgo, by consensus of all measurements.\nAlternatively, the meridian altitude of Mars was found at 12h 40m, using two quadrants, to be 50\u00b0 19\u2019, while the tail of Leo26 was 56\u00b0 45\u2019. Therefore, from the declinations and right ascensions of the fixed stars and our distances, Mars\u2019s position is determined as 13\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c Virgo, latitude 4\u00b0 7\u2019 55\u201c ^27. This is the Tychonic procedure. I have included the other for the sake of showing a consensus, and also that it might be evident that despite the lack of absolute perfection in the demonstration, short cuts either in computation or in our understanding can under certain circumstances be applied. For in that previous procedure there is less in the actual work than in the reporting of it. At Prague, 5\u00b0 Scorpio was rising ^28. Therefore, the nonagesimal was about 32\u00bd\u00b0 from the zenith. And since Mars\u2019s distance from the earth was rather more than half the sun\u2019s distance, the resulting parallax of about 5\u2019 opposite 32\u00bd\u00b0 in our parallactic table, shows a latitudinal parallax of 2\u2019 41\u201c. Thus the latitude as seen from the middle of the earth would be 4\u00b0 10\u2154\u2019 north. And because the altitude of the nonagesimal was 57\u00bd\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax at the horizon was 4\u2019 13\u201c. But since Mars was 38\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, the longitudinal parallax corresponding to this position is 2\u2019 36\u201c, and if this be eliminated, Mars would be placed at about 13\u00b0 18\u2019 Virgo ^29. At that moment, the sun\u2019s position was 10\u00b0 16\u2019 42\u201c Pisces. The distance between the bodies was 3\u00b0 1\u2019 18\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 4\u201c, and that of Mars, 24\u2019 5\u201c (for it was 24\u2019 18\u201c at 21\u00b0 Leo in 1585, and 24\u2019 at 26 Virgo in 1587). The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 24\u2019 9\u201c. The true opposition therefore followed 2 days 3 hours 43 minutes later, on 21 February\/3 March before dawn at 2h 13m, Mars being at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 35\u201c Virgo. Forty seconds must be subtracted to reduce the position to the orbit, putting Mars at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 Virgo, with slightly less latitude than before, since the latitude was then decreasing. It was therefore about 4\u00b0 10\u2019, or 4\u00b0 7\u2153\u2019 if the parallax be neglected.\n But because, since Tycho\u2019s death, we have not made frequent observations nor continued them over several days, it would be best, for certainty\u2019s sake, also to make use of those observations which David Fabricius of East Frisia, a sedulous practitioner of astronomy, has communicated to me.\nOn February 16, old style, at 5h in the morning, he took the planet\u2019s distances from the tail of Leo (for the latitude), from the neck of Leo,30 and, on the other hand, from the bright star in the southern wing of Virgo, so as to check its longitude by working it out twice.\nI could make use of Tycho\u2019s line of reasoning, which he routinely adopted in volume I of the Progymnasmata when (as here) the declination of the planet was not known. But because that method extends to ten operations, I prefer for the sake of brevity to proceed as I did before with my own observations. Here there are no hidden dangers.\nFirst, the star in the wing of Virgo, adjusted to our time, is at 4\u00b0 36\u2019 30\u201c Libra with latitude 2\u00b0 50\u2019 north. Fabricius found that Mars is 20\u00b0 18\u2019 westward from it on the zodiac, which puts Mars at about 14\u00b0 18\u2019 30\u201c Virgo. This is a preliminary, approximate figure: the longitude will shortly be corrected. Now the tail of Leo31 is at 16\u00b0 4\u2019 Virgo, with latitude 12\u00b0 18\u2019 North, and Mars was found to be 8\u00b0 17\u2019 distant from the Tail. What is sought is the distance of its parallel from the Tail, since the difference in longitude is 1\u00b0 45\u2019. Dividing the secant of 8\u00b0 17\u2019 by the secant of 1\u00b0 45\u2019 gives the secant of 8\u00b0 6\u2019, the arc sought. This subtracted from the fixed star\u2019s northern latitude of 12\u00b0 18\u2019 leaves Mars\u2019s latitude, 4\u00b0 12\u2019 north. This I now take as determined, and compare it with the latitudes of the fixed stars according to the laws of trigonometry. From the Wing of Virgo, I find Mars\u2019s longitude to be 14\u00b0 19\u2019 Virgo; from the Neck of Leo, 14\u00b0 23\u2019 36\u201c. The mean of these two is 14\u00b0 21\u2019 18\u201c Virgo. And since the sextant gave distances larger than the truth, the latitude would come out at 4\u00b0 14\u2019 north.\nOn the night following February 23, at 12h, he observed Mars in relation to five fixed stars: the Tail of Leo and Arcturus for latitude, and for the longitude, in the first instance, Spica (which followed it), and, in the second, the Neck of Leo and Cor Leonis (which preceded it).\nBy a rough estimate, I foresee that Mars is going to fall at 11\u00bc\u00b0 Virgo. It was found to be 9\u00b0 24\u2019 from the Tail of Leo, and hence, its latitude comes out at 4\u00b0 6\u2019 ^32. And now, through this and the latitudes of the fixed stars, together with their distances (17\u00b0 26\u2019 from Regulus, 17\u00b0 51\u2019 from the Neck of Leo, 37\u00b0 28\u2019 from Spica, 44\u00b0 15\u2019 from Arcturus), Mars\u2019s position comes out at 11\u00b0 21\u2019 23\u201c Virgo (from Regulus), 11\u00b0 20\u2019 52\u201c Virgo (from the Neck of Leo), and 11\u00b0 17\u2019 40\u201c (from Spica). Again (as you see) the distances err in being too great. For from the Heart and the Neck [of Leo], Mars is pushed a little eastward, and from Spica and Arcturus a little westward, and more from Arcturus, owing to its greater northern latitude ^33. The mean (ignoring Arcturus), 11\u00b0 19\u2019 20\u201c Virgo, is very nearly true. Also, the latitude is greater, namely, 4\u00b0 7\u2019 40\u201c north. Now from February 15 at 17h to 23 February at 12h, a period of 7 days 19 hours, Mars moved 3\u00b0 0\u2019: 180 minutes in 187 hours. That is, about one minute per hour. And if you wish to take it into account, the parallax (if any) is subtracted from the longitude on February 16 and a little is added on February 23.\n Because the last observation follows the time of observation found by me by 2 days 21 hours 47 min., add the motion corresponding to this time, 1\u00b0 7\u2019: the position will come out 12\u00b0 26\u2019 Virgo. The agreement is thus very good\u2014it could not be better\u2014given that both of us [that is, Kepler and Fabricius] work independently and do not rely on the facilities used by Tycho Brahe.","1720":"VIII. On 1595 October 30 at 8h 20m, the planet was found at 17\u00b0 47\u2019 15\u201c Taurus,19 not far from the nonagesimal. We may thus be sure of the parallax, although we must take it into account. The latitude was 0\u00b0 5\u2019 10\u201c north. The sun\u2019s position was 16\u00b0 50\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio. The distance between the stars was 56\u2019 45\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 35\u201c; that of Mars, 22\u2019 54\u201c, as appears by comparing the nearby observations. The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 23\u2019 29\u201c. If the distance between the stars be divided by this, it comes out to 40\u2019 47\u201c of a day, or 16 hours 19 min. Therefore, the true opposition was 0h 39m PM on October 31. Mars\u2019s position was 17\u00b0 31\u2019 40\u201c Taurus. This needs no reduction to the orbit, as it is nearly at the node. The latitude was about 0\u00b0 8\u2019 north. But comparison with the preceding and following days shows a latitude of about 5\u2019 north.\nIX. Let, at any rate, Mars\u2019s position on 1597 December 10 at 8h 30m be 3\u00b0 45\u00bd\u2019 Cancer (as above) ^20. The sun\u2019s position was 29\u00b0 4\u2019 53\u201c Sagittarius. The distance between the stars was 4\u00b0 40\u2019 37\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 61\u2019 20\u201c, that of Mars 23\u2019 40\u201c (for in 1580 the diurnal motion in Gemini was 23\u2019, and in 1582, at 17\u00b0 Cancer, it was 24\u2019). Therefore, the sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 25\u2019 0\u201c. These data show that the time of true opposition followed 3 days 7 hours 14 min. later, on December 14 at 3h 44m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 2\u00b0 27\u2153\u2019 Cancer. The reduction to the orbit (quite ridiculous here, since the observation itself has an uncertainty of several minutes) requires the addition of about 52\u201c. Therefore, the corrected position was 2\u00b0 28\u2019 Cancer. The latitude, from the table, was 3\u00b0 33\u2019 north.\nOn the same night, the one following December 10, at 12\u2159h, Fabricius in East Frisia found Mars\u2019s position to be 3\u00b0 40\u00bc\u2019 Cancer with latitude 3\u00b0 23\u2019 N. In this observation the longitude comes out nearly the same. For the motion over 3h 40m is 3\u00bd\u2019, so that in the Brahean observation too, at 12\u2159h Mars could have been at 3\u00b0 42\u2019 Cancer\u2014two minutes beyond the Fabrician position.\nX. On 1600 January 13\/23 at 11h 40m, the time being adjusted to Uraniborg time, the planet was observed at 10\u00b0 38\u2019 46\u201c Leo ^21. The sun\u2019s position was 3\u00b0 26\u2019 30\u201c Aquarius. The stars were 7\u00b0 12\u2019 16\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion for the next few days was 1\u00b0 1\u2019 3\u201c; that of Mars, 23\u2019 44\u201c. The sum: 1\u00b0 24\u2019 47\u201c. The opposition therefore followed 5 days 2h 22m after; that is, on January 19\/29 at 2h 2m in the morning, before dawn. Mars was at 8\u00b0 38\u2019 Leo. There is no need for reduction, since it is near the limit. The latitude, from the table, was 4\u00b0 30\u2019 50\u201c N.\nXI. On the evening of 1602 Febr. 18\/28 at 10h 30m, using the Tychonic  instruments (with the help of the learned Matthias Seiffard,22 bequeathed us by Tycho), I took the distance of Mars from the middle star of the tail of Ursa Major 23 to be 52\u00b0 22\u2019. And since the distance between Cor Leonis and Procyon was 37\u00b0 22\u2019 20\u201c, which should have been 37\u00b0 19\u2019 50\u201c,24 we know that the sextant reads 2\u00bd minutes high. Therefore, the corrected distance of Mars from the tail of Ursa was 52\u00b0 19\u00bd\u2019. And since the latitude of the fixed star is 56\u00b0 22\u2019, the remainder, by subtraction, is 4\u00b0 2\u00bd\u2019\u2014supposing that Mars was at precisely the same longitude as the fixed star. But because there was a difference of 3\u00be degrees between them (as is clear from the following observations), a slight correction is required.\n For let AB be 3\u00b0 43\u2019 30\u201c on a parallel close to the ecliptic, B Mars, C the fixed star, and BC 52\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c. Dividing the secant of BC by the secant of AB gives the  secant of CA, 52\u00b0 14\u2019, which, subtracted from 56\u00b0 22\u2019 (the latitude of the fixed star) leaves 4\u00b0 8\u2019 north as Mars\u2019s observed latitude. At the same time, we found 19\u00b0 23\u2019 between Mars and Cor Leonis (19\u00b0 20\u00bd corrected), and 21\u00b0 20\u2019 between Mars and the bright star in the wing of Virgo25 (21\u00b0 17\u00bd\u2019 corrected). From these two distances (using the latitudes of the stars and Mars), Mars\u2019s longitude is found to be 13\u00b0 19\u2019 6\u201c Virgo, by consensus of all measurements.\nAlternatively, the meridian altitude of Mars was found at 12h 40m, using two quadrants, to be 50\u00b0 19\u2019, while the tail of Leo26 was 56\u00b0 45\u2019. Therefore, from the declinations and right ascensions of the fixed stars and our distances, Mars\u2019s position is determined as 13\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c Virgo, latitude 4\u00b0 7\u2019 55\u201c ^27. This is the Tychonic procedure. I have included the other for the sake of showing a consensus, and also that it might be evident that despite the lack of absolute perfection in the demonstration, short cuts either in computation or in our understanding can under certain circumstances be applied. For in that previous procedure there is less in the actual work than in the reporting of it. At Prague, 5\u00b0 Scorpio was rising ^28. Therefore, the nonagesimal was about 32\u00bd\u00b0 from the zenith. And since Mars\u2019s distance from the earth was rather more than half the sun\u2019s distance, the resulting parallax of about 5\u2019 opposite 32\u00bd\u00b0 in our parallactic table, shows a latitudinal parallax of 2\u2019 41\u201c. Thus the latitude as seen from the middle of the earth would be 4\u00b0 10\u2154\u2019 north. And because the altitude of the nonagesimal was 57\u00bd\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax at the horizon was 4\u2019 13\u201c. But since Mars was 38\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, the longitudinal parallax corresponding to this position is 2\u2019 36\u201c, and if this be eliminated, Mars would be placed at about 13\u00b0 18\u2019 Virgo ^29. At that moment, the sun\u2019s position was 10\u00b0 16\u2019 42\u201c Pisces. The distance between the bodies was 3\u00b0 1\u2019 18\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 4\u201c, and that of Mars, 24\u2019 5\u201c (for it was 24\u2019 18\u201c at 21\u00b0 Leo in 1585, and 24\u2019 at 26 Virgo in 1587). The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 24\u2019 9\u201c. The true opposition therefore followed 2 days 3 hours 43 minutes later, on 21 February\/3 March before dawn at 2h 13m, Mars being at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 35\u201c Virgo. Forty seconds must be subtracted to reduce the position to the orbit, putting Mars at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 Virgo, with slightly less latitude than before, since the latitude was then decreasing. It was therefore about 4\u00b0 10\u2019, or 4\u00b0 7\u2153\u2019 if the parallax be neglected.\n But because, since Tycho\u2019s death, we have not made frequent observations nor continued them over several days, it would be best, for certainty\u2019s sake, also to make use of those observations which David Fabricius of East Frisia, a sedulous practitioner of astronomy, has communicated to me.\nOn February 16, old style, at 5h in the morning, he took the planet\u2019s distances from the tail of Leo (for the latitude), from the neck of Leo,30 and, on the other hand, from the bright star in the southern wing of Virgo, so as to check its longitude by working it out twice.\nI could make use of Tycho\u2019s line of reasoning, which he routinely adopted in volume I of the Progymnasmata when (as here) the declination of the planet was not known. But because that method extends to ten operations, I prefer for the sake of brevity to proceed as I did before with my own observations. Here there are no hidden dangers.\nFirst, the star in the wing of Virgo, adjusted to our time, is at 4\u00b0 36\u2019 30\u201c Libra with latitude 2\u00b0 50\u2019 north. Fabricius found that Mars is 20\u00b0 18\u2019 westward from it on the zodiac, which puts Mars at about 14\u00b0 18\u2019 30\u201c Virgo. This is a preliminary, approximate figure: the longitude will shortly be corrected. Now the tail of Leo31 is at 16\u00b0 4\u2019 Virgo, with latitude 12\u00b0 18\u2019 North, and Mars was found to be 8\u00b0 17\u2019 distant from the Tail. What is sought is the distance of its parallel from the Tail, since the difference in longitude is 1\u00b0 45\u2019. Dividing the secant of 8\u00b0 17\u2019 by the secant of 1\u00b0 45\u2019 gives the secant of 8\u00b0 6\u2019, the arc sought. This subtracted from the fixed star\u2019s northern latitude of 12\u00b0 18\u2019 leaves Mars\u2019s latitude, 4\u00b0 12\u2019 north. This I now take as determined, and compare it with the latitudes of the fixed stars according to the laws of trigonometry. From the Wing of Virgo, I find Mars\u2019s longitude to be 14\u00b0 19\u2019 Virgo; from the Neck of Leo, 14\u00b0 23\u2019 36\u201c. The mean of these two is 14\u00b0 21\u2019 18\u201c Virgo. And since the sextant gave distances larger than the truth, the latitude would come out at 4\u00b0 14\u2019 north.\nOn the night following February 23, at 12h, he observed Mars in relation to five fixed stars: the Tail of Leo and Arcturus for latitude, and for the longitude, in the first instance, Spica (which followed it), and, in the second, the Neck of Leo and Cor Leonis (which preceded it).\nBy a rough estimate, I foresee that Mars is going to fall at 11\u00bc\u00b0 Virgo. It was found to be 9\u00b0 24\u2019 from the Tail of Leo, and hence, its latitude comes out at 4\u00b0 6\u2019 ^32. And now, through this and the latitudes of the fixed stars, together with their distances (17\u00b0 26\u2019 from Regulus, 17\u00b0 51\u2019 from the Neck of Leo, 37\u00b0 28\u2019 from Spica, 44\u00b0 15\u2019 from Arcturus), Mars\u2019s position comes out at 11\u00b0 21\u2019 23\u201c Virgo (from Regulus), 11\u00b0 20\u2019 52\u201c Virgo (from the Neck of Leo), and 11\u00b0 17\u2019 40\u201c (from Spica). Again (as you see) the distances err in being too great. For from the Heart and the Neck [of Leo], Mars is pushed a little eastward, and from Spica and Arcturus a little westward, and more from Arcturus, owing to its greater northern latitude ^33. The mean (ignoring Arcturus), 11\u00b0 19\u2019 20\u201c Virgo, is very nearly true. Also, the latitude is greater, namely, 4\u00b0 7\u2019 40\u201c north. Now from February 15 at 17h to 23 February at 12h, a period of 7 days 19 hours, Mars moved 3\u00b0 0\u2019: 180 minutes in 187 hours. That is, about one minute per hour. And if you wish to take it into account, the parallax (if any) is subtracted from the longitude on February 16 and a little is added on February 23.\n Because the last observation follows the time of observation found by me by 2 days 21 hours 47 min., add the motion corresponding to this time, 1\u00b0 7\u2019: the position will come out 12\u00b0 26\u2019 Virgo. The agreement is thus very good\u2014it could not be better\u2014given that both of us [that is, Kepler and Fabricius] work independently and do not rely on the facilities used by Tycho Brahe.","1721":"VIII. On 1595 October 30 at 8h 20m, the planet was found at 17\u00b0 47\u2019 15\u201c Taurus,19 not far from the nonagesimal. We may thus be sure of the parallax, although we must take it into account. The latitude was 0\u00b0 5\u2019 10\u201c north. The sun\u2019s position was 16\u00b0 50\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio. The distance between the stars was 56\u2019 45\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 35\u201c; that of Mars, 22\u2019 54\u201c, as appears by comparing the nearby observations. The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 23\u2019 29\u201c. If the distance between the stars be divided by this, it comes out to 40\u2019 47\u201c of a day, or 16 hours 19 min. Therefore, the true opposition was 0h 39m PM on October 31. Mars\u2019s position was 17\u00b0 31\u2019 40\u201c Taurus. This needs no reduction to the orbit, as it is nearly at the node. The latitude was about 0\u00b0 8\u2019 north. But comparison with the preceding and following days shows a latitude of about 5\u2019 north.\nIX. Let, at any rate, Mars\u2019s position on 1597 December 10 at 8h 30m be 3\u00b0 45\u00bd\u2019 Cancer (as above) ^20. The sun\u2019s position was 29\u00b0 4\u2019 53\u201c Sagittarius. The distance between the stars was 4\u00b0 40\u2019 37\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 61\u2019 20\u201c, that of Mars 23\u2019 40\u201c (for in 1580 the diurnal motion in Gemini was 23\u2019, and in 1582, at 17\u00b0 Cancer, it was 24\u2019). Therefore, the sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 25\u2019 0\u201c. These data show that the time of true opposition followed 3 days 7 hours 14 min. later, on December 14 at 3h 44m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 2\u00b0 27\u2153\u2019 Cancer. The reduction to the orbit (quite ridiculous here, since the observation itself has an uncertainty of several minutes) requires the addition of about 52\u201c. Therefore, the corrected position was 2\u00b0 28\u2019 Cancer. The latitude, from the table, was 3\u00b0 33\u2019 north.\nOn the same night, the one following December 10, at 12\u2159h, Fabricius in East Frisia found Mars\u2019s position to be 3\u00b0 40\u00bc\u2019 Cancer with latitude 3\u00b0 23\u2019 N. In this observation the longitude comes out nearly the same. For the motion over 3h 40m is 3\u00bd\u2019, so that in the Brahean observation too, at 12\u2159h Mars could have been at 3\u00b0 42\u2019 Cancer\u2014two minutes beyond the Fabrician position.\nX. On 1600 January 13\/23 at 11h 40m, the time being adjusted to Uraniborg time, the planet was observed at 10\u00b0 38\u2019 46\u201c Leo ^21. The sun\u2019s position was 3\u00b0 26\u2019 30\u201c Aquarius. The stars were 7\u00b0 12\u2019 16\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion for the next few days was 1\u00b0 1\u2019 3\u201c; that of Mars, 23\u2019 44\u201c. The sum: 1\u00b0 24\u2019 47\u201c. The opposition therefore followed 5 days 2h 22m after; that is, on January 19\/29 at 2h 2m in the morning, before dawn. Mars was at 8\u00b0 38\u2019 Leo. There is no need for reduction, since it is near the limit. The latitude, from the table, was 4\u00b0 30\u2019 50\u201c N.\nXI. On the evening of 1602 Febr. 18\/28 at 10h 30m, using the Tychonic  instruments (with the help of the learned Matthias Seiffard,22 bequeathed us by Tycho), I took the distance of Mars from the middle star of the tail of Ursa Major 23 to be 52\u00b0 22\u2019. And since the distance between Cor Leonis and Procyon was 37\u00b0 22\u2019 20\u201c, which should have been 37\u00b0 19\u2019 50\u201c,24 we know that the sextant reads 2\u00bd minutes high. Therefore, the corrected distance of Mars from the tail of Ursa was 52\u00b0 19\u00bd\u2019. And since the latitude of the fixed star is 56\u00b0 22\u2019, the remainder, by subtraction, is 4\u00b0 2\u00bd\u2019\u2014supposing that Mars was at precisely the same longitude as the fixed star. But because there was a difference of 3\u00be degrees between them (as is clear from the following observations), a slight correction is required.\n For let AB be 3\u00b0 43\u2019 30\u201c on a parallel close to the ecliptic, B Mars, C the fixed star, and BC 52\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c. Dividing the secant of BC by the secant of AB gives the  secant of CA, 52\u00b0 14\u2019, which, subtracted from 56\u00b0 22\u2019 (the latitude of the fixed star) leaves 4\u00b0 8\u2019 north as Mars\u2019s observed latitude. At the same time, we found 19\u00b0 23\u2019 between Mars and Cor Leonis (19\u00b0 20\u00bd corrected), and 21\u00b0 20\u2019 between Mars and the bright star in the wing of Virgo25 (21\u00b0 17\u00bd\u2019 corrected). From these two distances (using the latitudes of the stars and Mars), Mars\u2019s longitude is found to be 13\u00b0 19\u2019 6\u201c Virgo, by consensus of all measurements.\nAlternatively, the meridian altitude of Mars was found at 12h 40m, using two quadrants, to be 50\u00b0 19\u2019, while the tail of Leo26 was 56\u00b0 45\u2019. Therefore, from the declinations and right ascensions of the fixed stars and our distances, Mars\u2019s position is determined as 13\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c Virgo, latitude 4\u00b0 7\u2019 55\u201c ^27. This is the Tychonic procedure. I have included the other for the sake of showing a consensus, and also that it might be evident that despite the lack of absolute perfection in the demonstration, short cuts either in computation or in our understanding can under certain circumstances be applied. For in that previous procedure there is less in the actual work than in the reporting of it. At Prague, 5\u00b0 Scorpio was rising ^28. Therefore, the nonagesimal was about 32\u00bd\u00b0 from the zenith. And since Mars\u2019s distance from the earth was rather more than half the sun\u2019s distance, the resulting parallax of about 5\u2019 opposite 32\u00bd\u00b0 in our parallactic table, shows a latitudinal parallax of 2\u2019 41\u201c. Thus the latitude as seen from the middle of the earth would be 4\u00b0 10\u2154\u2019 north. And because the altitude of the nonagesimal was 57\u00bd\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax at the horizon was 4\u2019 13\u201c. But since Mars was 38\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, the longitudinal parallax corresponding to this position is 2\u2019 36\u201c, and if this be eliminated, Mars would be placed at about 13\u00b0 18\u2019 Virgo ^29. At that moment, the sun\u2019s position was 10\u00b0 16\u2019 42\u201c Pisces. The distance between the bodies was 3\u00b0 1\u2019 18\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 4\u201c, and that of Mars, 24\u2019 5\u201c (for it was 24\u2019 18\u201c at 21\u00b0 Leo in 1585, and 24\u2019 at 26 Virgo in 1587). The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 24\u2019 9\u201c. The true opposition therefore followed 2 days 3 hours 43 minutes later, on 21 February\/3 March before dawn at 2h 13m, Mars being at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 35\u201c Virgo. Forty seconds must be subtracted to reduce the position to the orbit, putting Mars at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 Virgo, with slightly less latitude than before, since the latitude was then decreasing. It was therefore about 4\u00b0 10\u2019, or 4\u00b0 7\u2153\u2019 if the parallax be neglected.\n But because, since Tycho\u2019s death, we have not made frequent observations nor continued them over several days, it would be best, for certainty\u2019s sake, also to make use of those observations which David Fabricius of East Frisia, a sedulous practitioner of astronomy, has communicated to me.\nOn February 16, old style, at 5h in the morning, he took the planet\u2019s distances from the tail of Leo (for the latitude), from the neck of Leo,30 and, on the other hand, from the bright star in the southern wing of Virgo, so as to check its longitude by working it out twice.\nI could make use of Tycho\u2019s line of reasoning, which he routinely adopted in volume I of the Progymnasmata when (as here) the declination of the planet was not known. But because that method extends to ten operations, I prefer for the sake of brevity to proceed as I did before with my own observations. Here there are no hidden dangers.\nFirst, the star in the wing of Virgo, adjusted to our time, is at 4\u00b0 36\u2019 30\u201c Libra with latitude 2\u00b0 50\u2019 north. Fabricius found that Mars is 20\u00b0 18\u2019 westward from it on the zodiac, which puts Mars at about 14\u00b0 18\u2019 30\u201c Virgo. This is a preliminary, approximate figure: the longitude will shortly be corrected. Now the tail of Leo31 is at 16\u00b0 4\u2019 Virgo, with latitude 12\u00b0 18\u2019 North, and Mars was found to be 8\u00b0 17\u2019 distant from the Tail. What is sought is the distance of its parallel from the Tail, since the difference in longitude is 1\u00b0 45\u2019. Dividing the secant of 8\u00b0 17\u2019 by the secant of 1\u00b0 45\u2019 gives the secant of 8\u00b0 6\u2019, the arc sought. This subtracted from the fixed star\u2019s northern latitude of 12\u00b0 18\u2019 leaves Mars\u2019s latitude, 4\u00b0 12\u2019 north. This I now take as determined, and compare it with the latitudes of the fixed stars according to the laws of trigonometry. From the Wing of Virgo, I find Mars\u2019s longitude to be 14\u00b0 19\u2019 Virgo; from the Neck of Leo, 14\u00b0 23\u2019 36\u201c. The mean of these two is 14\u00b0 21\u2019 18\u201c Virgo. And since the sextant gave distances larger than the truth, the latitude would come out at 4\u00b0 14\u2019 north.\nOn the night following February 23, at 12h, he observed Mars in relation to five fixed stars: the Tail of Leo and Arcturus for latitude, and for the longitude, in the first instance, Spica (which followed it), and, in the second, the Neck of Leo and Cor Leonis (which preceded it).\nBy a rough estimate, I foresee that Mars is going to fall at 11\u00bc\u00b0 Virgo. It was found to be 9\u00b0 24\u2019 from the Tail of Leo, and hence, its latitude comes out at 4\u00b0 6\u2019 ^32. And now, through this and the latitudes of the fixed stars, together with their distances (17\u00b0 26\u2019 from Regulus, 17\u00b0 51\u2019 from the Neck of Leo, 37\u00b0 28\u2019 from Spica, 44\u00b0 15\u2019 from Arcturus), Mars\u2019s position comes out at 11\u00b0 21\u2019 23\u201c Virgo (from Regulus), 11\u00b0 20\u2019 52\u201c Virgo (from the Neck of Leo), and 11\u00b0 17\u2019 40\u201c (from Spica). Again (as you see) the distances err in being too great. For from the Heart and the Neck [of Leo], Mars is pushed a little eastward, and from Spica and Arcturus a little westward, and more from Arcturus, owing to its greater northern latitude ^33. The mean (ignoring Arcturus), 11\u00b0 19\u2019 20\u201c Virgo, is very nearly true. Also, the latitude is greater, namely, 4\u00b0 7\u2019 40\u201c north. Now from February 15 at 17h to 23 February at 12h, a period of 7 days 19 hours, Mars moved 3\u00b0 0\u2019: 180 minutes in 187 hours. That is, about one minute per hour. And if you wish to take it into account, the parallax (if any) is subtracted from the longitude on February 16 and a little is added on February 23.\n Because the last observation follows the time of observation found by me by 2 days 21 hours 47 min., add the motion corresponding to this time, 1\u00b0 7\u2019: the position will come out 12\u00b0 26\u2019 Virgo. The agreement is thus very good\u2014it could not be better\u2014given that both of us [that is, Kepler and Fabricius] work independently and do not rely on the facilities used by Tycho Brahe.","1722":"VIII. On 1595 October 30 at 8h 20m, the planet was found at 17\u00b0 47\u2019 15\u201c Taurus,19 not far from the nonagesimal. We may thus be sure of the parallax, although we must take it into account. The latitude was 0\u00b0 5\u2019 10\u201c north. The sun\u2019s position was 16\u00b0 50\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio. The distance between the stars was 56\u2019 45\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 35\u201c; that of Mars, 22\u2019 54\u201c, as appears by comparing the nearby observations. The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 23\u2019 29\u201c. If the distance between the stars be divided by this, it comes out to 40\u2019 47\u201c of a day, or 16 hours 19 min. Therefore, the true opposition was 0h 39m PM on October 31. Mars\u2019s position was 17\u00b0 31\u2019 40\u201c Taurus. This needs no reduction to the orbit, as it is nearly at the node. The latitude was about 0\u00b0 8\u2019 north. But comparison with the preceding and following days shows a latitude of about 5\u2019 north.\nIX. Let, at any rate, Mars\u2019s position on 1597 December 10 at 8h 30m be 3\u00b0 45\u00bd\u2019 Cancer (as above) ^20. The sun\u2019s position was 29\u00b0 4\u2019 53\u201c Sagittarius. The distance between the stars was 4\u00b0 40\u2019 37\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 61\u2019 20\u201c, that of Mars 23\u2019 40\u201c (for in 1580 the diurnal motion in Gemini was 23\u2019, and in 1582, at 17\u00b0 Cancer, it was 24\u2019). Therefore, the sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 25\u2019 0\u201c. These data show that the time of true opposition followed 3 days 7 hours 14 min. later, on December 14 at 3h 44m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 2\u00b0 27\u2153\u2019 Cancer. The reduction to the orbit (quite ridiculous here, since the observation itself has an uncertainty of several minutes) requires the addition of about 52\u201c. Therefore, the corrected position was 2\u00b0 28\u2019 Cancer. The latitude, from the table, was 3\u00b0 33\u2019 north.\nOn the same night, the one following December 10, at 12\u2159h, Fabricius in East Frisia found Mars\u2019s position to be 3\u00b0 40\u00bc\u2019 Cancer with latitude 3\u00b0 23\u2019 N. In this observation the longitude comes out nearly the same. For the motion over 3h 40m is 3\u00bd\u2019, so that in the Brahean observation too, at 12\u2159h Mars could have been at 3\u00b0 42\u2019 Cancer\u2014two minutes beyond the Fabrician position.\nX. On 1600 January 13\/23 at 11h 40m, the time being adjusted to Uraniborg time, the planet was observed at 10\u00b0 38\u2019 46\u201c Leo ^21. The sun\u2019s position was 3\u00b0 26\u2019 30\u201c Aquarius. The stars were 7\u00b0 12\u2019 16\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion for the next few days was 1\u00b0 1\u2019 3\u201c; that of Mars, 23\u2019 44\u201c. The sum: 1\u00b0 24\u2019 47\u201c. The opposition therefore followed 5 days 2h 22m after; that is, on January 19\/29 at 2h 2m in the morning, before dawn. Mars was at 8\u00b0 38\u2019 Leo. There is no need for reduction, since it is near the limit. The latitude, from the table, was 4\u00b0 30\u2019 50\u201c N.\nXI. On the evening of 1602 Febr. 18\/28 at 10h 30m, using the Tychonic  instruments (with the help of the learned Matthias Seiffard,22 bequeathed us by Tycho), I took the distance of Mars from the middle star of the tail of Ursa Major 23 to be 52\u00b0 22\u2019. And since the distance between Cor Leonis and Procyon was 37\u00b0 22\u2019 20\u201c, which should have been 37\u00b0 19\u2019 50\u201c,24 we know that the sextant reads 2\u00bd minutes high. Therefore, the corrected distance of Mars from the tail of Ursa was 52\u00b0 19\u00bd\u2019. And since the latitude of the fixed star is 56\u00b0 22\u2019, the remainder, by subtraction, is 4\u00b0 2\u00bd\u2019\u2014supposing that Mars was at precisely the same longitude as the fixed star. But because there was a difference of 3\u00be degrees between them (as is clear from the following observations), a slight correction is required.\n For let AB be 3\u00b0 43\u2019 30\u201c on a parallel close to the ecliptic, B Mars, C the fixed star, and BC 52\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c. Dividing the secant of BC by the secant of AB gives the  secant of CA, 52\u00b0 14\u2019, which, subtracted from 56\u00b0 22\u2019 (the latitude of the fixed star) leaves 4\u00b0 8\u2019 north as Mars\u2019s observed latitude. At the same time, we found 19\u00b0 23\u2019 between Mars and Cor Leonis (19\u00b0 20\u00bd corrected), and 21\u00b0 20\u2019 between Mars and the bright star in the wing of Virgo25 (21\u00b0 17\u00bd\u2019 corrected). From these two distances (using the latitudes of the stars and Mars), Mars\u2019s longitude is found to be 13\u00b0 19\u2019 6\u201c Virgo, by consensus of all measurements.\nAlternatively, the meridian altitude of Mars was found at 12h 40m, using two quadrants, to be 50\u00b0 19\u2019, while the tail of Leo26 was 56\u00b0 45\u2019. Therefore, from the declinations and right ascensions of the fixed stars and our distances, Mars\u2019s position is determined as 13\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c Virgo, latitude 4\u00b0 7\u2019 55\u201c ^27. This is the Tychonic procedure. I have included the other for the sake of showing a consensus, and also that it might be evident that despite the lack of absolute perfection in the demonstration, short cuts either in computation or in our understanding can under certain circumstances be applied. For in that previous procedure there is less in the actual work than in the reporting of it. At Prague, 5\u00b0 Scorpio was rising ^28. Therefore, the nonagesimal was about 32\u00bd\u00b0 from the zenith. And since Mars\u2019s distance from the earth was rather more than half the sun\u2019s distance, the resulting parallax of about 5\u2019 opposite 32\u00bd\u00b0 in our parallactic table, shows a latitudinal parallax of 2\u2019 41\u201c. Thus the latitude as seen from the middle of the earth would be 4\u00b0 10\u2154\u2019 north. And because the altitude of the nonagesimal was 57\u00bd\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax at the horizon was 4\u2019 13\u201c. But since Mars was 38\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, the longitudinal parallax corresponding to this position is 2\u2019 36\u201c, and if this be eliminated, Mars would be placed at about 13\u00b0 18\u2019 Virgo ^29. At that moment, the sun\u2019s position was 10\u00b0 16\u2019 42\u201c Pisces. The distance between the bodies was 3\u00b0 1\u2019 18\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 4\u201c, and that of Mars, 24\u2019 5\u201c (for it was 24\u2019 18\u201c at 21\u00b0 Leo in 1585, and 24\u2019 at 26 Virgo in 1587). The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 24\u2019 9\u201c. The true opposition therefore followed 2 days 3 hours 43 minutes later, on 21 February\/3 March before dawn at 2h 13m, Mars being at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 35\u201c Virgo. Forty seconds must be subtracted to reduce the position to the orbit, putting Mars at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 Virgo, with slightly less latitude than before, since the latitude was then decreasing. It was therefore about 4\u00b0 10\u2019, or 4\u00b0 7\u2153\u2019 if the parallax be neglected.\n But because, since Tycho\u2019s death, we have not made frequent observations nor continued them over several days, it would be best, for certainty\u2019s sake, also to make use of those observations which David Fabricius of East Frisia, a sedulous practitioner of astronomy, has communicated to me.\nOn February 16, old style, at 5h in the morning, he took the planet\u2019s distances from the tail of Leo (for the latitude), from the neck of Leo,30 and, on the other hand, from the bright star in the southern wing of Virgo, so as to check its longitude by working it out twice.\nI could make use of Tycho\u2019s line of reasoning, which he routinely adopted in volume I of the Progymnasmata when (as here) the declination of the planet was not known. But because that method extends to ten operations, I prefer for the sake of brevity to proceed as I did before with my own observations. Here there are no hidden dangers.\nFirst, the star in the wing of Virgo, adjusted to our time, is at 4\u00b0 36\u2019 30\u201c Libra with latitude 2\u00b0 50\u2019 north. Fabricius found that Mars is 20\u00b0 18\u2019 westward from it on the zodiac, which puts Mars at about 14\u00b0 18\u2019 30\u201c Virgo. This is a preliminary, approximate figure: the longitude will shortly be corrected. Now the tail of Leo31 is at 16\u00b0 4\u2019 Virgo, with latitude 12\u00b0 18\u2019 North, and Mars was found to be 8\u00b0 17\u2019 distant from the Tail. What is sought is the distance of its parallel from the Tail, since the difference in longitude is 1\u00b0 45\u2019. Dividing the secant of 8\u00b0 17\u2019 by the secant of 1\u00b0 45\u2019 gives the secant of 8\u00b0 6\u2019, the arc sought. This subtracted from the fixed star\u2019s northern latitude of 12\u00b0 18\u2019 leaves Mars\u2019s latitude, 4\u00b0 12\u2019 north. This I now take as determined, and compare it with the latitudes of the fixed stars according to the laws of trigonometry. From the Wing of Virgo, I find Mars\u2019s longitude to be 14\u00b0 19\u2019 Virgo; from the Neck of Leo, 14\u00b0 23\u2019 36\u201c. The mean of these two is 14\u00b0 21\u2019 18\u201c Virgo. And since the sextant gave distances larger than the truth, the latitude would come out at 4\u00b0 14\u2019 north.\nOn the night following February 23, at 12h, he observed Mars in relation to five fixed stars: the Tail of Leo and Arcturus for latitude, and for the longitude, in the first instance, Spica (which followed it), and, in the second, the Neck of Leo and Cor Leonis (which preceded it).\nBy a rough estimate, I foresee that Mars is going to fall at 11\u00bc\u00b0 Virgo. It was found to be 9\u00b0 24\u2019 from the Tail of Leo, and hence, its latitude comes out at 4\u00b0 6\u2019 ^32. And now, through this and the latitudes of the fixed stars, together with their distances (17\u00b0 26\u2019 from Regulus, 17\u00b0 51\u2019 from the Neck of Leo, 37\u00b0 28\u2019 from Spica, 44\u00b0 15\u2019 from Arcturus), Mars\u2019s position comes out at 11\u00b0 21\u2019 23\u201c Virgo (from Regulus), 11\u00b0 20\u2019 52\u201c Virgo (from the Neck of Leo), and 11\u00b0 17\u2019 40\u201c (from Spica). Again (as you see) the distances err in being too great. For from the Heart and the Neck [of Leo], Mars is pushed a little eastward, and from Spica and Arcturus a little westward, and more from Arcturus, owing to its greater northern latitude ^33. The mean (ignoring Arcturus), 11\u00b0 19\u2019 20\u201c Virgo, is very nearly true. Also, the latitude is greater, namely, 4\u00b0 7\u2019 40\u201c north. Now from February 15 at 17h to 23 February at 12h, a period of 7 days 19 hours, Mars moved 3\u00b0 0\u2019: 180 minutes in 187 hours. That is, about one minute per hour. And if you wish to take it into account, the parallax (if any) is subtracted from the longitude on February 16 and a little is added on February 23.\n Because the last observation follows the time of observation found by me by 2 days 21 hours 47 min., add the motion corresponding to this time, 1\u00b0 7\u2019: the position will come out 12\u00b0 26\u2019 Virgo. The agreement is thus very good\u2014it could not be better\u2014given that both of us [that is, Kepler and Fabricius] work independently and do not rely on the facilities used by Tycho Brahe.","1723":"VIII. On 1595 October 30 at 8h 20m, the planet was found at 17\u00b0 47\u2019 15\u201c Taurus,19 not far from the nonagesimal. We may thus be sure of the parallax, although we must take it into account. The latitude was 0\u00b0 5\u2019 10\u201c north. The sun\u2019s position was 16\u00b0 50\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio. The distance between the stars was 56\u2019 45\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 35\u201c; that of Mars, 22\u2019 54\u201c, as appears by comparing the nearby observations. The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 23\u2019 29\u201c. If the distance between the stars be divided by this, it comes out to 40\u2019 47\u201c of a day, or 16 hours 19 min. Therefore, the true opposition was 0h 39m PM on October 31. Mars\u2019s position was 17\u00b0 31\u2019 40\u201c Taurus. This needs no reduction to the orbit, as it is nearly at the node. The latitude was about 0\u00b0 8\u2019 north. But comparison with the preceding and following days shows a latitude of about 5\u2019 north.\nIX. Let, at any rate, Mars\u2019s position on 1597 December 10 at 8h 30m be 3\u00b0 45\u00bd\u2019 Cancer (as above) ^20. The sun\u2019s position was 29\u00b0 4\u2019 53\u201c Sagittarius. The distance between the stars was 4\u00b0 40\u2019 37\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 61\u2019 20\u201c, that of Mars 23\u2019 40\u201c (for in 1580 the diurnal motion in Gemini was 23\u2019, and in 1582, at 17\u00b0 Cancer, it was 24\u2019). Therefore, the sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 25\u2019 0\u201c. These data show that the time of true opposition followed 3 days 7 hours 14 min. later, on December 14 at 3h 44m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 2\u00b0 27\u2153\u2019 Cancer. The reduction to the orbit (quite ridiculous here, since the observation itself has an uncertainty of several minutes) requires the addition of about 52\u201c. Therefore, the corrected position was 2\u00b0 28\u2019 Cancer. The latitude, from the table, was 3\u00b0 33\u2019 north.\nOn the same night, the one following December 10, at 12\u2159h, Fabricius in East Frisia found Mars\u2019s position to be 3\u00b0 40\u00bc\u2019 Cancer with latitude 3\u00b0 23\u2019 N. In this observation the longitude comes out nearly the same. For the motion over 3h 40m is 3\u00bd\u2019, so that in the Brahean observation too, at 12\u2159h Mars could have been at 3\u00b0 42\u2019 Cancer\u2014two minutes beyond the Fabrician position.\nX. On 1600 January 13\/23 at 11h 40m, the time being adjusted to Uraniborg time, the planet was observed at 10\u00b0 38\u2019 46\u201c Leo ^21. The sun\u2019s position was 3\u00b0 26\u2019 30\u201c Aquarius. The stars were 7\u00b0 12\u2019 16\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion for the next few days was 1\u00b0 1\u2019 3\u201c; that of Mars, 23\u2019 44\u201c. The sum: 1\u00b0 24\u2019 47\u201c. The opposition therefore followed 5 days 2h 22m after; that is, on January 19\/29 at 2h 2m in the morning, before dawn. Mars was at 8\u00b0 38\u2019 Leo. There is no need for reduction, since it is near the limit. The latitude, from the table, was 4\u00b0 30\u2019 50\u201c N.\nXI. On the evening of 1602 Febr. 18\/28 at 10h 30m, using the Tychonic  instruments (with the help of the learned Matthias Seiffard,22 bequeathed us by Tycho), I took the distance of Mars from the middle star of the tail of Ursa Major 23 to be 52\u00b0 22\u2019. And since the distance between Cor Leonis and Procyon was 37\u00b0 22\u2019 20\u201c, which should have been 37\u00b0 19\u2019 50\u201c,24 we know that the sextant reads 2\u00bd minutes high. Therefore, the corrected distance of Mars from the tail of Ursa was 52\u00b0 19\u00bd\u2019. And since the latitude of the fixed star is 56\u00b0 22\u2019, the remainder, by subtraction, is 4\u00b0 2\u00bd\u2019\u2014supposing that Mars was at precisely the same longitude as the fixed star. But because there was a difference of 3\u00be degrees between them (as is clear from the following observations), a slight correction is required.\n For let AB be 3\u00b0 43\u2019 30\u201c on a parallel close to the ecliptic, B Mars, C the fixed star, and BC 52\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c. Dividing the secant of BC by the secant of AB gives the  secant of CA, 52\u00b0 14\u2019, which, subtracted from 56\u00b0 22\u2019 (the latitude of the fixed star) leaves 4\u00b0 8\u2019 north as Mars\u2019s observed latitude. At the same time, we found 19\u00b0 23\u2019 between Mars and Cor Leonis (19\u00b0 20\u00bd corrected), and 21\u00b0 20\u2019 between Mars and the bright star in the wing of Virgo25 (21\u00b0 17\u00bd\u2019 corrected). From these two distances (using the latitudes of the stars and Mars), Mars\u2019s longitude is found to be 13\u00b0 19\u2019 6\u201c Virgo, by consensus of all measurements.\nAlternatively, the meridian altitude of Mars was found at 12h 40m, using two quadrants, to be 50\u00b0 19\u2019, while the tail of Leo26 was 56\u00b0 45\u2019. Therefore, from the declinations and right ascensions of the fixed stars and our distances, Mars\u2019s position is determined as 13\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c Virgo, latitude 4\u00b0 7\u2019 55\u201c ^27. This is the Tychonic procedure. I have included the other for the sake of showing a consensus, and also that it might be evident that despite the lack of absolute perfection in the demonstration, short cuts either in computation or in our understanding can under certain circumstances be applied. For in that previous procedure there is less in the actual work than in the reporting of it. At Prague, 5\u00b0 Scorpio was rising ^28. Therefore, the nonagesimal was about 32\u00bd\u00b0 from the zenith. And since Mars\u2019s distance from the earth was rather more than half the sun\u2019s distance, the resulting parallax of about 5\u2019 opposite 32\u00bd\u00b0 in our parallactic table, shows a latitudinal parallax of 2\u2019 41\u201c. Thus the latitude as seen from the middle of the earth would be 4\u00b0 10\u2154\u2019 north. And because the altitude of the nonagesimal was 57\u00bd\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax at the horizon was 4\u2019 13\u201c. But since Mars was 38\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, the longitudinal parallax corresponding to this position is 2\u2019 36\u201c, and if this be eliminated, Mars would be placed at about 13\u00b0 18\u2019 Virgo ^29. At that moment, the sun\u2019s position was 10\u00b0 16\u2019 42\u201c Pisces. The distance between the bodies was 3\u00b0 1\u2019 18\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 4\u201c, and that of Mars, 24\u2019 5\u201c (for it was 24\u2019 18\u201c at 21\u00b0 Leo in 1585, and 24\u2019 at 26 Virgo in 1587). The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 24\u2019 9\u201c. The true opposition therefore followed 2 days 3 hours 43 minutes later, on 21 February\/3 March before dawn at 2h 13m, Mars being at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 35\u201c Virgo. Forty seconds must be subtracted to reduce the position to the orbit, putting Mars at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 Virgo, with slightly less latitude than before, since the latitude was then decreasing. It was therefore about 4\u00b0 10\u2019, or 4\u00b0 7\u2153\u2019 if the parallax be neglected.\n But because, since Tycho\u2019s death, we have not made frequent observations nor continued them over several days, it would be best, for certainty\u2019s sake, also to make use of those observations which David Fabricius of East Frisia, a sedulous practitioner of astronomy, has communicated to me.\nOn February 16, old style, at 5h in the morning, he took the planet\u2019s distances from the tail of Leo (for the latitude), from the neck of Leo,30 and, on the other hand, from the bright star in the southern wing of Virgo, so as to check its longitude by working it out twice.\nI could make use of Tycho\u2019s line of reasoning, which he routinely adopted in volume I of the Progymnasmata when (as here) the declination of the planet was not known. But because that method extends to ten operations, I prefer for the sake of brevity to proceed as I did before with my own observations. Here there are no hidden dangers.\nFirst, the star in the wing of Virgo, adjusted to our time, is at 4\u00b0 36\u2019 30\u201c Libra with latitude 2\u00b0 50\u2019 north. Fabricius found that Mars is 20\u00b0 18\u2019 westward from it on the zodiac, which puts Mars at about 14\u00b0 18\u2019 30\u201c Virgo. This is a preliminary, approximate figure: the longitude will shortly be corrected. Now the tail of Leo31 is at 16\u00b0 4\u2019 Virgo, with latitude 12\u00b0 18\u2019 North, and Mars was found to be 8\u00b0 17\u2019 distant from the Tail. What is sought is the distance of its parallel from the Tail, since the difference in longitude is 1\u00b0 45\u2019. Dividing the secant of 8\u00b0 17\u2019 by the secant of 1\u00b0 45\u2019 gives the secant of 8\u00b0 6\u2019, the arc sought. This subtracted from the fixed star\u2019s northern latitude of 12\u00b0 18\u2019 leaves Mars\u2019s latitude, 4\u00b0 12\u2019 north. This I now take as determined, and compare it with the latitudes of the fixed stars according to the laws of trigonometry. From the Wing of Virgo, I find Mars\u2019s longitude to be 14\u00b0 19\u2019 Virgo; from the Neck of Leo, 14\u00b0 23\u2019 36\u201c. The mean of these two is 14\u00b0 21\u2019 18\u201c Virgo. And since the sextant gave distances larger than the truth, the latitude would come out at 4\u00b0 14\u2019 north.\nOn the night following February 23, at 12h, he observed Mars in relation to five fixed stars: the Tail of Leo and Arcturus for latitude, and for the longitude, in the first instance, Spica (which followed it), and, in the second, the Neck of Leo and Cor Leonis (which preceded it).\nBy a rough estimate, I foresee that Mars is going to fall at 11\u00bc\u00b0 Virgo. It was found to be 9\u00b0 24\u2019 from the Tail of Leo, and hence, its latitude comes out at 4\u00b0 6\u2019 ^32. And now, through this and the latitudes of the fixed stars, together with their distances (17\u00b0 26\u2019 from Regulus, 17\u00b0 51\u2019 from the Neck of Leo, 37\u00b0 28\u2019 from Spica, 44\u00b0 15\u2019 from Arcturus), Mars\u2019s position comes out at 11\u00b0 21\u2019 23\u201c Virgo (from Regulus), 11\u00b0 20\u2019 52\u201c Virgo (from the Neck of Leo), and 11\u00b0 17\u2019 40\u201c (from Spica). Again (as you see) the distances err in being too great. For from the Heart and the Neck [of Leo], Mars is pushed a little eastward, and from Spica and Arcturus a little westward, and more from Arcturus, owing to its greater northern latitude ^33. The mean (ignoring Arcturus), 11\u00b0 19\u2019 20\u201c Virgo, is very nearly true. Also, the latitude is greater, namely, 4\u00b0 7\u2019 40\u201c north. Now from February 15 at 17h to 23 February at 12h, a period of 7 days 19 hours, Mars moved 3\u00b0 0\u2019: 180 minutes in 187 hours. That is, about one minute per hour. And if you wish to take it into account, the parallax (if any) is subtracted from the longitude on February 16 and a little is added on February 23.\n Because the last observation follows the time of observation found by me by 2 days 21 hours 47 min., add the motion corresponding to this time, 1\u00b0 7\u2019: the position will come out 12\u00b0 26\u2019 Virgo. The agreement is thus very good\u2014it could not be better\u2014given that both of us [that is, Kepler and Fabricius] work independently and do not rely on the facilities used by Tycho Brahe.","1724":"VIII. On 1595 October 30 at 8h 20m, the planet was found at 17\u00b0 47\u2019 15\u201c Taurus,19 not far from the nonagesimal. We may thus be sure of the parallax, although we must take it into account. The latitude was 0\u00b0 5\u2019 10\u201c north. The sun\u2019s position was 16\u00b0 50\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio. The distance between the stars was 56\u2019 45\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 35\u201c; that of Mars, 22\u2019 54\u201c, as appears by comparing the nearby observations. The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 23\u2019 29\u201c. If the distance between the stars be divided by this, it comes out to 40\u2019 47\u201c of a day, or 16 hours 19 min. Therefore, the true opposition was 0h 39m PM on October 31. Mars\u2019s position was 17\u00b0 31\u2019 40\u201c Taurus. This needs no reduction to the orbit, as it is nearly at the node. The latitude was about 0\u00b0 8\u2019 north. But comparison with the preceding and following days shows a latitude of about 5\u2019 north.\nIX. Let, at any rate, Mars\u2019s position on 1597 December 10 at 8h 30m be 3\u00b0 45\u00bd\u2019 Cancer (as above) ^20. The sun\u2019s position was 29\u00b0 4\u2019 53\u201c Sagittarius. The distance between the stars was 4\u00b0 40\u2019 37\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 61\u2019 20\u201c, that of Mars 23\u2019 40\u201c (for in 1580 the diurnal motion in Gemini was 23\u2019, and in 1582, at 17\u00b0 Cancer, it was 24\u2019). Therefore, the sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 25\u2019 0\u201c. These data show that the time of true opposition followed 3 days 7 hours 14 min. later, on December 14 at 3h 44m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 2\u00b0 27\u2153\u2019 Cancer. The reduction to the orbit (quite ridiculous here, since the observation itself has an uncertainty of several minutes) requires the addition of about 52\u201c. Therefore, the corrected position was 2\u00b0 28\u2019 Cancer. The latitude, from the table, was 3\u00b0 33\u2019 north.\nOn the same night, the one following December 10, at 12\u2159h, Fabricius in East Frisia found Mars\u2019s position to be 3\u00b0 40\u00bc\u2019 Cancer with latitude 3\u00b0 23\u2019 N. In this observation the longitude comes out nearly the same. For the motion over 3h 40m is 3\u00bd\u2019, so that in the Brahean observation too, at 12\u2159h Mars could have been at 3\u00b0 42\u2019 Cancer\u2014two minutes beyond the Fabrician position.\nX. On 1600 January 13\/23 at 11h 40m, the time being adjusted to Uraniborg time, the planet was observed at 10\u00b0 38\u2019 46\u201c Leo ^21. The sun\u2019s position was 3\u00b0 26\u2019 30\u201c Aquarius. The stars were 7\u00b0 12\u2019 16\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion for the next few days was 1\u00b0 1\u2019 3\u201c; that of Mars, 23\u2019 44\u201c. The sum: 1\u00b0 24\u2019 47\u201c. The opposition therefore followed 5 days 2h 22m after; that is, on January 19\/29 at 2h 2m in the morning, before dawn. Mars was at 8\u00b0 38\u2019 Leo. There is no need for reduction, since it is near the limit. The latitude, from the table, was 4\u00b0 30\u2019 50\u201c N.\nXI. On the evening of 1602 Febr. 18\/28 at 10h 30m, using the Tychonic  instruments (with the help of the learned Matthias Seiffard,22 bequeathed us by Tycho), I took the distance of Mars from the middle star of the tail of Ursa Major 23 to be 52\u00b0 22\u2019. And since the distance between Cor Leonis and Procyon was 37\u00b0 22\u2019 20\u201c, which should have been 37\u00b0 19\u2019 50\u201c,24 we know that the sextant reads 2\u00bd minutes high. Therefore, the corrected distance of Mars from the tail of Ursa was 52\u00b0 19\u00bd\u2019. And since the latitude of the fixed star is 56\u00b0 22\u2019, the remainder, by subtraction, is 4\u00b0 2\u00bd\u2019\u2014supposing that Mars was at precisely the same longitude as the fixed star. But because there was a difference of 3\u00be degrees between them (as is clear from the following observations), a slight correction is required.\n For let AB be 3\u00b0 43\u2019 30\u201c on a parallel close to the ecliptic, B Mars, C the fixed star, and BC 52\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c. Dividing the secant of BC by the secant of AB gives the  secant of CA, 52\u00b0 14\u2019, which, subtracted from 56\u00b0 22\u2019 (the latitude of the fixed star) leaves 4\u00b0 8\u2019 north as Mars\u2019s observed latitude. At the same time, we found 19\u00b0 23\u2019 between Mars and Cor Leonis (19\u00b0 20\u00bd corrected), and 21\u00b0 20\u2019 between Mars and the bright star in the wing of Virgo25 (21\u00b0 17\u00bd\u2019 corrected). From these two distances (using the latitudes of the stars and Mars), Mars\u2019s longitude is found to be 13\u00b0 19\u2019 6\u201c Virgo, by consensus of all measurements.\nAlternatively, the meridian altitude of Mars was found at 12h 40m, using two quadrants, to be 50\u00b0 19\u2019, while the tail of Leo26 was 56\u00b0 45\u2019. Therefore, from the declinations and right ascensions of the fixed stars and our distances, Mars\u2019s position is determined as 13\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c Virgo, latitude 4\u00b0 7\u2019 55\u201c ^27. This is the Tychonic procedure. I have included the other for the sake of showing a consensus, and also that it might be evident that despite the lack of absolute perfection in the demonstration, short cuts either in computation or in our understanding can under certain circumstances be applied. For in that previous procedure there is less in the actual work than in the reporting of it. At Prague, 5\u00b0 Scorpio was rising ^28. Therefore, the nonagesimal was about 32\u00bd\u00b0 from the zenith. And since Mars\u2019s distance from the earth was rather more than half the sun\u2019s distance, the resulting parallax of about 5\u2019 opposite 32\u00bd\u00b0 in our parallactic table, shows a latitudinal parallax of 2\u2019 41\u201c. Thus the latitude as seen from the middle of the earth would be 4\u00b0 10\u2154\u2019 north. And because the altitude of the nonagesimal was 57\u00bd\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax at the horizon was 4\u2019 13\u201c. But since Mars was 38\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, the longitudinal parallax corresponding to this position is 2\u2019 36\u201c, and if this be eliminated, Mars would be placed at about 13\u00b0 18\u2019 Virgo ^29. At that moment, the sun\u2019s position was 10\u00b0 16\u2019 42\u201c Pisces. The distance between the bodies was 3\u00b0 1\u2019 18\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 4\u201c, and that of Mars, 24\u2019 5\u201c (for it was 24\u2019 18\u201c at 21\u00b0 Leo in 1585, and 24\u2019 at 26 Virgo in 1587). The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 24\u2019 9\u201c. The true opposition therefore followed 2 days 3 hours 43 minutes later, on 21 February\/3 March before dawn at 2h 13m, Mars being at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 35\u201c Virgo. Forty seconds must be subtracted to reduce the position to the orbit, putting Mars at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 Virgo, with slightly less latitude than before, since the latitude was then decreasing. It was therefore about 4\u00b0 10\u2019, or 4\u00b0 7\u2153\u2019 if the parallax be neglected.\n But because, since Tycho\u2019s death, we have not made frequent observations nor continued them over several days, it would be best, for certainty\u2019s sake, also to make use of those observations which David Fabricius of East Frisia, a sedulous practitioner of astronomy, has communicated to me.\nOn February 16, old style, at 5h in the morning, he took the planet\u2019s distances from the tail of Leo (for the latitude), from the neck of Leo,30 and, on the other hand, from the bright star in the southern wing of Virgo, so as to check its longitude by working it out twice.\nI could make use of Tycho\u2019s line of reasoning, which he routinely adopted in volume I of the Progymnasmata when (as here) the declination of the planet was not known. But because that method extends to ten operations, I prefer for the sake of brevity to proceed as I did before with my own observations. Here there are no hidden dangers.\nFirst, the star in the wing of Virgo, adjusted to our time, is at 4\u00b0 36\u2019 30\u201c Libra with latitude 2\u00b0 50\u2019 north. Fabricius found that Mars is 20\u00b0 18\u2019 westward from it on the zodiac, which puts Mars at about 14\u00b0 18\u2019 30\u201c Virgo. This is a preliminary, approximate figure: the longitude will shortly be corrected. Now the tail of Leo31 is at 16\u00b0 4\u2019 Virgo, with latitude 12\u00b0 18\u2019 North, and Mars was found to be 8\u00b0 17\u2019 distant from the Tail. What is sought is the distance of its parallel from the Tail, since the difference in longitude is 1\u00b0 45\u2019. Dividing the secant of 8\u00b0 17\u2019 by the secant of 1\u00b0 45\u2019 gives the secant of 8\u00b0 6\u2019, the arc sought. This subtracted from the fixed star\u2019s northern latitude of 12\u00b0 18\u2019 leaves Mars\u2019s latitude, 4\u00b0 12\u2019 north. This I now take as determined, and compare it with the latitudes of the fixed stars according to the laws of trigonometry. From the Wing of Virgo, I find Mars\u2019s longitude to be 14\u00b0 19\u2019 Virgo; from the Neck of Leo, 14\u00b0 23\u2019 36\u201c. The mean of these two is 14\u00b0 21\u2019 18\u201c Virgo. And since the sextant gave distances larger than the truth, the latitude would come out at 4\u00b0 14\u2019 north.\nOn the night following February 23, at 12h, he observed Mars in relation to five fixed stars: the Tail of Leo and Arcturus for latitude, and for the longitude, in the first instance, Spica (which followed it), and, in the second, the Neck of Leo and Cor Leonis (which preceded it).\nBy a rough estimate, I foresee that Mars is going to fall at 11\u00bc\u00b0 Virgo. It was found to be 9\u00b0 24\u2019 from the Tail of Leo, and hence, its latitude comes out at 4\u00b0 6\u2019 ^32. And now, through this and the latitudes of the fixed stars, together with their distances (17\u00b0 26\u2019 from Regulus, 17\u00b0 51\u2019 from the Neck of Leo, 37\u00b0 28\u2019 from Spica, 44\u00b0 15\u2019 from Arcturus), Mars\u2019s position comes out at 11\u00b0 21\u2019 23\u201c Virgo (from Regulus), 11\u00b0 20\u2019 52\u201c Virgo (from the Neck of Leo), and 11\u00b0 17\u2019 40\u201c (from Spica). Again (as you see) the distances err in being too great. For from the Heart and the Neck [of Leo], Mars is pushed a little eastward, and from Spica and Arcturus a little westward, and more from Arcturus, owing to its greater northern latitude ^33. The mean (ignoring Arcturus), 11\u00b0 19\u2019 20\u201c Virgo, is very nearly true. Also, the latitude is greater, namely, 4\u00b0 7\u2019 40\u201c north. Now from February 15 at 17h to 23 February at 12h, a period of 7 days 19 hours, Mars moved 3\u00b0 0\u2019: 180 minutes in 187 hours. That is, about one minute per hour. And if you wish to take it into account, the parallax (if any) is subtracted from the longitude on February 16 and a little is added on February 23.\n Because the last observation follows the time of observation found by me by 2 days 21 hours 47 min., add the motion corresponding to this time, 1\u00b0 7\u2019: the position will come out 12\u00b0 26\u2019 Virgo. The agreement is thus very good\u2014it could not be better\u2014given that both of us [that is, Kepler and Fabricius] work independently and do not rely on the facilities used by Tycho Brahe.","1725":"VIII. On 1595 October 30 at 8h 20m, the planet was found at 17\u00b0 47\u2019 15\u201c Taurus,19 not far from the nonagesimal. We may thus be sure of the parallax, although we must take it into account. The latitude was 0\u00b0 5\u2019 10\u201c north. The sun\u2019s position was 16\u00b0 50\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio. The distance between the stars was 56\u2019 45\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 35\u201c; that of Mars, 22\u2019 54\u201c, as appears by comparing the nearby observations. The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 23\u2019 29\u201c. If the distance between the stars be divided by this, it comes out to 40\u2019 47\u201c of a day, or 16 hours 19 min. Therefore, the true opposition was 0h 39m PM on October 31. Mars\u2019s position was 17\u00b0 31\u2019 40\u201c Taurus. This needs no reduction to the orbit, as it is nearly at the node. The latitude was about 0\u00b0 8\u2019 north. But comparison with the preceding and following days shows a latitude of about 5\u2019 north.\nIX. Let, at any rate, Mars\u2019s position on 1597 December 10 at 8h 30m be 3\u00b0 45\u00bd\u2019 Cancer (as above) ^20. The sun\u2019s position was 29\u00b0 4\u2019 53\u201c Sagittarius. The distance between the stars was 4\u00b0 40\u2019 37\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 61\u2019 20\u201c, that of Mars 23\u2019 40\u201c (for in 1580 the diurnal motion in Gemini was 23\u2019, and in 1582, at 17\u00b0 Cancer, it was 24\u2019). Therefore, the sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 25\u2019 0\u201c. These data show that the time of true opposition followed 3 days 7 hours 14 min. later, on December 14 at 3h 44m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 2\u00b0 27\u2153\u2019 Cancer. The reduction to the orbit (quite ridiculous here, since the observation itself has an uncertainty of several minutes) requires the addition of about 52\u201c. Therefore, the corrected position was 2\u00b0 28\u2019 Cancer. The latitude, from the table, was 3\u00b0 33\u2019 north.\nOn the same night, the one following December 10, at 12\u2159h, Fabricius in East Frisia found Mars\u2019s position to be 3\u00b0 40\u00bc\u2019 Cancer with latitude 3\u00b0 23\u2019 N. In this observation the longitude comes out nearly the same. For the motion over 3h 40m is 3\u00bd\u2019, so that in the Brahean observation too, at 12\u2159h Mars could have been at 3\u00b0 42\u2019 Cancer\u2014two minutes beyond the Fabrician position.\nX. On 1600 January 13\/23 at 11h 40m, the time being adjusted to Uraniborg time, the planet was observed at 10\u00b0 38\u2019 46\u201c Leo ^21. The sun\u2019s position was 3\u00b0 26\u2019 30\u201c Aquarius. The stars were 7\u00b0 12\u2019 16\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion for the next few days was 1\u00b0 1\u2019 3\u201c; that of Mars, 23\u2019 44\u201c. The sum: 1\u00b0 24\u2019 47\u201c. The opposition therefore followed 5 days 2h 22m after; that is, on January 19\/29 at 2h 2m in the morning, before dawn. Mars was at 8\u00b0 38\u2019 Leo. There is no need for reduction, since it is near the limit. The latitude, from the table, was 4\u00b0 30\u2019 50\u201c N.\nXI. On the evening of 1602 Febr. 18\/28 at 10h 30m, using the Tychonic  instruments (with the help of the learned Matthias Seiffard,22 bequeathed us by Tycho), I took the distance of Mars from the middle star of the tail of Ursa Major 23 to be 52\u00b0 22\u2019. And since the distance between Cor Leonis and Procyon was 37\u00b0 22\u2019 20\u201c, which should have been 37\u00b0 19\u2019 50\u201c,24 we know that the sextant reads 2\u00bd minutes high. Therefore, the corrected distance of Mars from the tail of Ursa was 52\u00b0 19\u00bd\u2019. And since the latitude of the fixed star is 56\u00b0 22\u2019, the remainder, by subtraction, is 4\u00b0 2\u00bd\u2019\u2014supposing that Mars was at precisely the same longitude as the fixed star. But because there was a difference of 3\u00be degrees between them (as is clear from the following observations), a slight correction is required.\n For let AB be 3\u00b0 43\u2019 30\u201c on a parallel close to the ecliptic, B Mars, C the fixed star, and BC 52\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c. Dividing the secant of BC by the secant of AB gives the  secant of CA, 52\u00b0 14\u2019, which, subtracted from 56\u00b0 22\u2019 (the latitude of the fixed star) leaves 4\u00b0 8\u2019 north as Mars\u2019s observed latitude. At the same time, we found 19\u00b0 23\u2019 between Mars and Cor Leonis (19\u00b0 20\u00bd corrected), and 21\u00b0 20\u2019 between Mars and the bright star in the wing of Virgo25 (21\u00b0 17\u00bd\u2019 corrected). From these two distances (using the latitudes of the stars and Mars), Mars\u2019s longitude is found to be 13\u00b0 19\u2019 6\u201c Virgo, by consensus of all measurements.\nAlternatively, the meridian altitude of Mars was found at 12h 40m, using two quadrants, to be 50\u00b0 19\u2019, while the tail of Leo26 was 56\u00b0 45\u2019. Therefore, from the declinations and right ascensions of the fixed stars and our distances, Mars\u2019s position is determined as 13\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c Virgo, latitude 4\u00b0 7\u2019 55\u201c ^27. This is the Tychonic procedure. I have included the other for the sake of showing a consensus, and also that it might be evident that despite the lack of absolute perfection in the demonstration, short cuts either in computation or in our understanding can under certain circumstances be applied. For in that previous procedure there is less in the actual work than in the reporting of it. At Prague, 5\u00b0 Scorpio was rising ^28. Therefore, the nonagesimal was about 32\u00bd\u00b0 from the zenith. And since Mars\u2019s distance from the earth was rather more than half the sun\u2019s distance, the resulting parallax of about 5\u2019 opposite 32\u00bd\u00b0 in our parallactic table, shows a latitudinal parallax of 2\u2019 41\u201c. Thus the latitude as seen from the middle of the earth would be 4\u00b0 10\u2154\u2019 north. And because the altitude of the nonagesimal was 57\u00bd\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax at the horizon was 4\u2019 13\u201c. But since Mars was 38\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, the longitudinal parallax corresponding to this position is 2\u2019 36\u201c, and if this be eliminated, Mars would be placed at about 13\u00b0 18\u2019 Virgo ^29. At that moment, the sun\u2019s position was 10\u00b0 16\u2019 42\u201c Pisces. The distance between the bodies was 3\u00b0 1\u2019 18\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 4\u201c, and that of Mars, 24\u2019 5\u201c (for it was 24\u2019 18\u201c at 21\u00b0 Leo in 1585, and 24\u2019 at 26 Virgo in 1587). The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 24\u2019 9\u201c. The true opposition therefore followed 2 days 3 hours 43 minutes later, on 21 February\/3 March before dawn at 2h 13m, Mars being at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 35\u201c Virgo. Forty seconds must be subtracted to reduce the position to the orbit, putting Mars at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 Virgo, with slightly less latitude than before, since the latitude was then decreasing. It was therefore about 4\u00b0 10\u2019, or 4\u00b0 7\u2153\u2019 if the parallax be neglected.\n But because, since Tycho\u2019s death, we have not made frequent observations nor continued them over several days, it would be best, for certainty\u2019s sake, also to make use of those observations which David Fabricius of East Frisia, a sedulous practitioner of astronomy, has communicated to me.\nOn February 16, old style, at 5h in the morning, he took the planet\u2019s distances from the tail of Leo (for the latitude), from the neck of Leo,30 and, on the other hand, from the bright star in the southern wing of Virgo, so as to check its longitude by working it out twice.\nI could make use of Tycho\u2019s line of reasoning, which he routinely adopted in volume I of the Progymnasmata when (as here) the declination of the planet was not known. But because that method extends to ten operations, I prefer for the sake of brevity to proceed as I did before with my own observations. Here there are no hidden dangers.\nFirst, the star in the wing of Virgo, adjusted to our time, is at 4\u00b0 36\u2019 30\u201c Libra with latitude 2\u00b0 50\u2019 north. Fabricius found that Mars is 20\u00b0 18\u2019 westward from it on the zodiac, which puts Mars at about 14\u00b0 18\u2019 30\u201c Virgo. This is a preliminary, approximate figure: the longitude will shortly be corrected. Now the tail of Leo31 is at 16\u00b0 4\u2019 Virgo, with latitude 12\u00b0 18\u2019 North, and Mars was found to be 8\u00b0 17\u2019 distant from the Tail. What is sought is the distance of its parallel from the Tail, since the difference in longitude is 1\u00b0 45\u2019. Dividing the secant of 8\u00b0 17\u2019 by the secant of 1\u00b0 45\u2019 gives the secant of 8\u00b0 6\u2019, the arc sought. This subtracted from the fixed star\u2019s northern latitude of 12\u00b0 18\u2019 leaves Mars\u2019s latitude, 4\u00b0 12\u2019 north. This I now take as determined, and compare it with the latitudes of the fixed stars according to the laws of trigonometry. From the Wing of Virgo, I find Mars\u2019s longitude to be 14\u00b0 19\u2019 Virgo; from the Neck of Leo, 14\u00b0 23\u2019 36\u201c. The mean of these two is 14\u00b0 21\u2019 18\u201c Virgo. And since the sextant gave distances larger than the truth, the latitude would come out at 4\u00b0 14\u2019 north.\nOn the night following February 23, at 12h, he observed Mars in relation to five fixed stars: the Tail of Leo and Arcturus for latitude, and for the longitude, in the first instance, Spica (which followed it), and, in the second, the Neck of Leo and Cor Leonis (which preceded it).\nBy a rough estimate, I foresee that Mars is going to fall at 11\u00bc\u00b0 Virgo. It was found to be 9\u00b0 24\u2019 from the Tail of Leo, and hence, its latitude comes out at 4\u00b0 6\u2019 ^32. And now, through this and the latitudes of the fixed stars, together with their distances (17\u00b0 26\u2019 from Regulus, 17\u00b0 51\u2019 from the Neck of Leo, 37\u00b0 28\u2019 from Spica, 44\u00b0 15\u2019 from Arcturus), Mars\u2019s position comes out at 11\u00b0 21\u2019 23\u201c Virgo (from Regulus), 11\u00b0 20\u2019 52\u201c Virgo (from the Neck of Leo), and 11\u00b0 17\u2019 40\u201c (from Spica). Again (as you see) the distances err in being too great. For from the Heart and the Neck [of Leo], Mars is pushed a little eastward, and from Spica and Arcturus a little westward, and more from Arcturus, owing to its greater northern latitude ^33. The mean (ignoring Arcturus), 11\u00b0 19\u2019 20\u201c Virgo, is very nearly true. Also, the latitude is greater, namely, 4\u00b0 7\u2019 40\u201c north. Now from February 15 at 17h to 23 February at 12h, a period of 7 days 19 hours, Mars moved 3\u00b0 0\u2019: 180 minutes in 187 hours. That is, about one minute per hour. And if you wish to take it into account, the parallax (if any) is subtracted from the longitude on February 16 and a little is added on February 23.\n Because the last observation follows the time of observation found by me by 2 days 21 hours 47 min., add the motion corresponding to this time, 1\u00b0 7\u2019: the position will come out 12\u00b0 26\u2019 Virgo. The agreement is thus very good\u2014it could not be better\u2014given that both of us [that is, Kepler and Fabricius] work independently and do not rely on the facilities used by Tycho Brahe.","1726":"VIII. On 1595 October 30 at 8h 20m, the planet was found at 17\u00b0 47\u2019 15\u201c Taurus,19 not far from the nonagesimal. We may thus be sure of the parallax, although we must take it into account. The latitude was 0\u00b0 5\u2019 10\u201c north. The sun\u2019s position was 16\u00b0 50\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio. The distance between the stars was 56\u2019 45\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 35\u201c; that of Mars, 22\u2019 54\u201c, as appears by comparing the nearby observations. The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 23\u2019 29\u201c. If the distance between the stars be divided by this, it comes out to 40\u2019 47\u201c of a day, or 16 hours 19 min. Therefore, the true opposition was 0h 39m PM on October 31. Mars\u2019s position was 17\u00b0 31\u2019 40\u201c Taurus. This needs no reduction to the orbit, as it is nearly at the node. The latitude was about 0\u00b0 8\u2019 north. But comparison with the preceding and following days shows a latitude of about 5\u2019 north.\nIX. Let, at any rate, Mars\u2019s position on 1597 December 10 at 8h 30m be 3\u00b0 45\u00bd\u2019 Cancer (as above) ^20. The sun\u2019s position was 29\u00b0 4\u2019 53\u201c Sagittarius. The distance between the stars was 4\u00b0 40\u2019 37\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 61\u2019 20\u201c, that of Mars 23\u2019 40\u201c (for in 1580 the diurnal motion in Gemini was 23\u2019, and in 1582, at 17\u00b0 Cancer, it was 24\u2019). Therefore, the sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 25\u2019 0\u201c. These data show that the time of true opposition followed 3 days 7 hours 14 min. later, on December 14 at 3h 44m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 2\u00b0 27\u2153\u2019 Cancer. The reduction to the orbit (quite ridiculous here, since the observation itself has an uncertainty of several minutes) requires the addition of about 52\u201c. Therefore, the corrected position was 2\u00b0 28\u2019 Cancer. The latitude, from the table, was 3\u00b0 33\u2019 north.\nOn the same night, the one following December 10, at 12\u2159h, Fabricius in East Frisia found Mars\u2019s position to be 3\u00b0 40\u00bc\u2019 Cancer with latitude 3\u00b0 23\u2019 N. In this observation the longitude comes out nearly the same. For the motion over 3h 40m is 3\u00bd\u2019, so that in the Brahean observation too, at 12\u2159h Mars could have been at 3\u00b0 42\u2019 Cancer\u2014two minutes beyond the Fabrician position.\nX. On 1600 January 13\/23 at 11h 40m, the time being adjusted to Uraniborg time, the planet was observed at 10\u00b0 38\u2019 46\u201c Leo ^21. The sun\u2019s position was 3\u00b0 26\u2019 30\u201c Aquarius. The stars were 7\u00b0 12\u2019 16\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion for the next few days was 1\u00b0 1\u2019 3\u201c; that of Mars, 23\u2019 44\u201c. The sum: 1\u00b0 24\u2019 47\u201c. The opposition therefore followed 5 days 2h 22m after; that is, on January 19\/29 at 2h 2m in the morning, before dawn. Mars was at 8\u00b0 38\u2019 Leo. There is no need for reduction, since it is near the limit. The latitude, from the table, was 4\u00b0 30\u2019 50\u201c N.\nXI. On the evening of 1602 Febr. 18\/28 at 10h 30m, using the Tychonic  instruments (with the help of the learned Matthias Seiffard,22 bequeathed us by Tycho), I took the distance of Mars from the middle star of the tail of Ursa Major 23 to be 52\u00b0 22\u2019. And since the distance between Cor Leonis and Procyon was 37\u00b0 22\u2019 20\u201c, which should have been 37\u00b0 19\u2019 50\u201c,24 we know that the sextant reads 2\u00bd minutes high. Therefore, the corrected distance of Mars from the tail of Ursa was 52\u00b0 19\u00bd\u2019. And since the latitude of the fixed star is 56\u00b0 22\u2019, the remainder, by subtraction, is 4\u00b0 2\u00bd\u2019\u2014supposing that Mars was at precisely the same longitude as the fixed star. But because there was a difference of 3\u00be degrees between them (as is clear from the following observations), a slight correction is required.\n For let AB be 3\u00b0 43\u2019 30\u201c on a parallel close to the ecliptic, B Mars, C the fixed star, and BC 52\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c. Dividing the secant of BC by the secant of AB gives the  secant of CA, 52\u00b0 14\u2019, which, subtracted from 56\u00b0 22\u2019 (the latitude of the fixed star) leaves 4\u00b0 8\u2019 north as Mars\u2019s observed latitude. At the same time, we found 19\u00b0 23\u2019 between Mars and Cor Leonis (19\u00b0 20\u00bd corrected), and 21\u00b0 20\u2019 between Mars and the bright star in the wing of Virgo25 (21\u00b0 17\u00bd\u2019 corrected). From these two distances (using the latitudes of the stars and Mars), Mars\u2019s longitude is found to be 13\u00b0 19\u2019 6\u201c Virgo, by consensus of all measurements.\nAlternatively, the meridian altitude of Mars was found at 12h 40m, using two quadrants, to be 50\u00b0 19\u2019, while the tail of Leo26 was 56\u00b0 45\u2019. Therefore, from the declinations and right ascensions of the fixed stars and our distances, Mars\u2019s position is determined as 13\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c Virgo, latitude 4\u00b0 7\u2019 55\u201c ^27. This is the Tychonic procedure. I have included the other for the sake of showing a consensus, and also that it might be evident that despite the lack of absolute perfection in the demonstration, short cuts either in computation or in our understanding can under certain circumstances be applied. For in that previous procedure there is less in the actual work than in the reporting of it. At Prague, 5\u00b0 Scorpio was rising ^28. Therefore, the nonagesimal was about 32\u00bd\u00b0 from the zenith. And since Mars\u2019s distance from the earth was rather more than half the sun\u2019s distance, the resulting parallax of about 5\u2019 opposite 32\u00bd\u00b0 in our parallactic table, shows a latitudinal parallax of 2\u2019 41\u201c. Thus the latitude as seen from the middle of the earth would be 4\u00b0 10\u2154\u2019 north. And because the altitude of the nonagesimal was 57\u00bd\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax at the horizon was 4\u2019 13\u201c. But since Mars was 38\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, the longitudinal parallax corresponding to this position is 2\u2019 36\u201c, and if this be eliminated, Mars would be placed at about 13\u00b0 18\u2019 Virgo ^29. At that moment, the sun\u2019s position was 10\u00b0 16\u2019 42\u201c Pisces. The distance between the bodies was 3\u00b0 1\u2019 18\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 4\u201c, and that of Mars, 24\u2019 5\u201c (for it was 24\u2019 18\u201c at 21\u00b0 Leo in 1585, and 24\u2019 at 26 Virgo in 1587). The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 24\u2019 9\u201c. The true opposition therefore followed 2 days 3 hours 43 minutes later, on 21 February\/3 March before dawn at 2h 13m, Mars being at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 35\u201c Virgo. Forty seconds must be subtracted to reduce the position to the orbit, putting Mars at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 Virgo, with slightly less latitude than before, since the latitude was then decreasing. It was therefore about 4\u00b0 10\u2019, or 4\u00b0 7\u2153\u2019 if the parallax be neglected.\n But because, since Tycho\u2019s death, we have not made frequent observations nor continued them over several days, it would be best, for certainty\u2019s sake, also to make use of those observations which David Fabricius of East Frisia, a sedulous practitioner of astronomy, has communicated to me.\nOn February 16, old style, at 5h in the morning, he took the planet\u2019s distances from the tail of Leo (for the latitude), from the neck of Leo,30 and, on the other hand, from the bright star in the southern wing of Virgo, so as to check its longitude by working it out twice.\nI could make use of Tycho\u2019s line of reasoning, which he routinely adopted in volume I of the Progymnasmata when (as here) the declination of the planet was not known. But because that method extends to ten operations, I prefer for the sake of brevity to proceed as I did before with my own observations. Here there are no hidden dangers.\nFirst, the star in the wing of Virgo, adjusted to our time, is at 4\u00b0 36\u2019 30\u201c Libra with latitude 2\u00b0 50\u2019 north. Fabricius found that Mars is 20\u00b0 18\u2019 westward from it on the zodiac, which puts Mars at about 14\u00b0 18\u2019 30\u201c Virgo. This is a preliminary, approximate figure: the longitude will shortly be corrected. Now the tail of Leo31 is at 16\u00b0 4\u2019 Virgo, with latitude 12\u00b0 18\u2019 North, and Mars was found to be 8\u00b0 17\u2019 distant from the Tail. What is sought is the distance of its parallel from the Tail, since the difference in longitude is 1\u00b0 45\u2019. Dividing the secant of 8\u00b0 17\u2019 by the secant of 1\u00b0 45\u2019 gives the secant of 8\u00b0 6\u2019, the arc sought. This subtracted from the fixed star\u2019s northern latitude of 12\u00b0 18\u2019 leaves Mars\u2019s latitude, 4\u00b0 12\u2019 north. This I now take as determined, and compare it with the latitudes of the fixed stars according to the laws of trigonometry. From the Wing of Virgo, I find Mars\u2019s longitude to be 14\u00b0 19\u2019 Virgo; from the Neck of Leo, 14\u00b0 23\u2019 36\u201c. The mean of these two is 14\u00b0 21\u2019 18\u201c Virgo. And since the sextant gave distances larger than the truth, the latitude would come out at 4\u00b0 14\u2019 north.\nOn the night following February 23, at 12h, he observed Mars in relation to five fixed stars: the Tail of Leo and Arcturus for latitude, and for the longitude, in the first instance, Spica (which followed it), and, in the second, the Neck of Leo and Cor Leonis (which preceded it).\nBy a rough estimate, I foresee that Mars is going to fall at 11\u00bc\u00b0 Virgo. It was found to be 9\u00b0 24\u2019 from the Tail of Leo, and hence, its latitude comes out at 4\u00b0 6\u2019 ^32. And now, through this and the latitudes of the fixed stars, together with their distances (17\u00b0 26\u2019 from Regulus, 17\u00b0 51\u2019 from the Neck of Leo, 37\u00b0 28\u2019 from Spica, 44\u00b0 15\u2019 from Arcturus), Mars\u2019s position comes out at 11\u00b0 21\u2019 23\u201c Virgo (from Regulus), 11\u00b0 20\u2019 52\u201c Virgo (from the Neck of Leo), and 11\u00b0 17\u2019 40\u201c (from Spica). Again (as you see) the distances err in being too great. For from the Heart and the Neck [of Leo], Mars is pushed a little eastward, and from Spica and Arcturus a little westward, and more from Arcturus, owing to its greater northern latitude ^33. The mean (ignoring Arcturus), 11\u00b0 19\u2019 20\u201c Virgo, is very nearly true. Also, the latitude is greater, namely, 4\u00b0 7\u2019 40\u201c north. Now from February 15 at 17h to 23 February at 12h, a period of 7 days 19 hours, Mars moved 3\u00b0 0\u2019: 180 minutes in 187 hours. That is, about one minute per hour. And if you wish to take it into account, the parallax (if any) is subtracted from the longitude on February 16 and a little is added on February 23.\n Because the last observation follows the time of observation found by me by 2 days 21 hours 47 min., add the motion corresponding to this time, 1\u00b0 7\u2019: the position will come out 12\u00b0 26\u2019 Virgo. The agreement is thus very good\u2014it could not be better\u2014given that both of us [that is, Kepler and Fabricius] work independently and do not rely on the facilities used by Tycho Brahe.","1727":"VIII. On 1595 October 30 at 8h 20m, the planet was found at 17\u00b0 47\u2019 15\u201c Taurus,19 not far from the nonagesimal. We may thus be sure of the parallax, although we must take it into account. The latitude was 0\u00b0 5\u2019 10\u201c north. The sun\u2019s position was 16\u00b0 50\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio. The distance between the stars was 56\u2019 45\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 35\u201c; that of Mars, 22\u2019 54\u201c, as appears by comparing the nearby observations. The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 23\u2019 29\u201c. If the distance between the stars be divided by this, it comes out to 40\u2019 47\u201c of a day, or 16 hours 19 min. Therefore, the true opposition was 0h 39m PM on October 31. Mars\u2019s position was 17\u00b0 31\u2019 40\u201c Taurus. This needs no reduction to the orbit, as it is nearly at the node. The latitude was about 0\u00b0 8\u2019 north. But comparison with the preceding and following days shows a latitude of about 5\u2019 north.\nIX. Let, at any rate, Mars\u2019s position on 1597 December 10 at 8h 30m be 3\u00b0 45\u00bd\u2019 Cancer (as above) ^20. The sun\u2019s position was 29\u00b0 4\u2019 53\u201c Sagittarius. The distance between the stars was 4\u00b0 40\u2019 37\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 61\u2019 20\u201c, that of Mars 23\u2019 40\u201c (for in 1580 the diurnal motion in Gemini was 23\u2019, and in 1582, at 17\u00b0 Cancer, it was 24\u2019). Therefore, the sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 25\u2019 0\u201c. These data show that the time of true opposition followed 3 days 7 hours 14 min. later, on December 14 at 3h 44m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 2\u00b0 27\u2153\u2019 Cancer. The reduction to the orbit (quite ridiculous here, since the observation itself has an uncertainty of several minutes) requires the addition of about 52\u201c. Therefore, the corrected position was 2\u00b0 28\u2019 Cancer. The latitude, from the table, was 3\u00b0 33\u2019 north.\nOn the same night, the one following December 10, at 12\u2159h, Fabricius in East Frisia found Mars\u2019s position to be 3\u00b0 40\u00bc\u2019 Cancer with latitude 3\u00b0 23\u2019 N. In this observation the longitude comes out nearly the same. For the motion over 3h 40m is 3\u00bd\u2019, so that in the Brahean observation too, at 12\u2159h Mars could have been at 3\u00b0 42\u2019 Cancer\u2014two minutes beyond the Fabrician position.\nX. On 1600 January 13\/23 at 11h 40m, the time being adjusted to Uraniborg time, the planet was observed at 10\u00b0 38\u2019 46\u201c Leo ^21. The sun\u2019s position was 3\u00b0 26\u2019 30\u201c Aquarius. The stars were 7\u00b0 12\u2019 16\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion for the next few days was 1\u00b0 1\u2019 3\u201c; that of Mars, 23\u2019 44\u201c. The sum: 1\u00b0 24\u2019 47\u201c. The opposition therefore followed 5 days 2h 22m after; that is, on January 19\/29 at 2h 2m in the morning, before dawn. Mars was at 8\u00b0 38\u2019 Leo. There is no need for reduction, since it is near the limit. The latitude, from the table, was 4\u00b0 30\u2019 50\u201c N.\nXI. On the evening of 1602 Febr. 18\/28 at 10h 30m, using the Tychonic  instruments (with the help of the learned Matthias Seiffard,22 bequeathed us by Tycho), I took the distance of Mars from the middle star of the tail of Ursa Major 23 to be 52\u00b0 22\u2019. And since the distance between Cor Leonis and Procyon was 37\u00b0 22\u2019 20\u201c, which should have been 37\u00b0 19\u2019 50\u201c,24 we know that the sextant reads 2\u00bd minutes high. Therefore, the corrected distance of Mars from the tail of Ursa was 52\u00b0 19\u00bd\u2019. And since the latitude of the fixed star is 56\u00b0 22\u2019, the remainder, by subtraction, is 4\u00b0 2\u00bd\u2019\u2014supposing that Mars was at precisely the same longitude as the fixed star. But because there was a difference of 3\u00be degrees between them (as is clear from the following observations), a slight correction is required.\n For let AB be 3\u00b0 43\u2019 30\u201c on a parallel close to the ecliptic, B Mars, C the fixed star, and BC 52\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c. Dividing the secant of BC by the secant of AB gives the  secant of CA, 52\u00b0 14\u2019, which, subtracted from 56\u00b0 22\u2019 (the latitude of the fixed star) leaves 4\u00b0 8\u2019 north as Mars\u2019s observed latitude. At the same time, we found 19\u00b0 23\u2019 between Mars and Cor Leonis (19\u00b0 20\u00bd corrected), and 21\u00b0 20\u2019 between Mars and the bright star in the wing of Virgo25 (21\u00b0 17\u00bd\u2019 corrected). From these two distances (using the latitudes of the stars and Mars), Mars\u2019s longitude is found to be 13\u00b0 19\u2019 6\u201c Virgo, by consensus of all measurements.\nAlternatively, the meridian altitude of Mars was found at 12h 40m, using two quadrants, to be 50\u00b0 19\u2019, while the tail of Leo26 was 56\u00b0 45\u2019. Therefore, from the declinations and right ascensions of the fixed stars and our distances, Mars\u2019s position is determined as 13\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c Virgo, latitude 4\u00b0 7\u2019 55\u201c ^27. This is the Tychonic procedure. I have included the other for the sake of showing a consensus, and also that it might be evident that despite the lack of absolute perfection in the demonstration, short cuts either in computation or in our understanding can under certain circumstances be applied. For in that previous procedure there is less in the actual work than in the reporting of it. At Prague, 5\u00b0 Scorpio was rising ^28. Therefore, the nonagesimal was about 32\u00bd\u00b0 from the zenith. And since Mars\u2019s distance from the earth was rather more than half the sun\u2019s distance, the resulting parallax of about 5\u2019 opposite 32\u00bd\u00b0 in our parallactic table, shows a latitudinal parallax of 2\u2019 41\u201c. Thus the latitude as seen from the middle of the earth would be 4\u00b0 10\u2154\u2019 north. And because the altitude of the nonagesimal was 57\u00bd\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax at the horizon was 4\u2019 13\u201c. But since Mars was 38\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, the longitudinal parallax corresponding to this position is 2\u2019 36\u201c, and if this be eliminated, Mars would be placed at about 13\u00b0 18\u2019 Virgo ^29. At that moment, the sun\u2019s position was 10\u00b0 16\u2019 42\u201c Pisces. The distance between the bodies was 3\u00b0 1\u2019 18\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 4\u201c, and that of Mars, 24\u2019 5\u201c (for it was 24\u2019 18\u201c at 21\u00b0 Leo in 1585, and 24\u2019 at 26 Virgo in 1587). The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 24\u2019 9\u201c. The true opposition therefore followed 2 days 3 hours 43 minutes later, on 21 February\/3 March before dawn at 2h 13m, Mars being at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 35\u201c Virgo. Forty seconds must be subtracted to reduce the position to the orbit, putting Mars at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 Virgo, with slightly less latitude than before, since the latitude was then decreasing. It was therefore about 4\u00b0 10\u2019, or 4\u00b0 7\u2153\u2019 if the parallax be neglected.\n But because, since Tycho\u2019s death, we have not made frequent observations nor continued them over several days, it would be best, for certainty\u2019s sake, also to make use of those observations which David Fabricius of East Frisia, a sedulous practitioner of astronomy, has communicated to me.\nOn February 16, old style, at 5h in the morning, he took the planet\u2019s distances from the tail of Leo (for the latitude), from the neck of Leo,30 and, on the other hand, from the bright star in the southern wing of Virgo, so as to check its longitude by working it out twice.\nI could make use of Tycho\u2019s line of reasoning, which he routinely adopted in volume I of the Progymnasmata when (as here) the declination of the planet was not known. But because that method extends to ten operations, I prefer for the sake of brevity to proceed as I did before with my own observations. Here there are no hidden dangers.\nFirst, the star in the wing of Virgo, adjusted to our time, is at 4\u00b0 36\u2019 30\u201c Libra with latitude 2\u00b0 50\u2019 north. Fabricius found that Mars is 20\u00b0 18\u2019 westward from it on the zodiac, which puts Mars at about 14\u00b0 18\u2019 30\u201c Virgo. This is a preliminary, approximate figure: the longitude will shortly be corrected. Now the tail of Leo31 is at 16\u00b0 4\u2019 Virgo, with latitude 12\u00b0 18\u2019 North, and Mars was found to be 8\u00b0 17\u2019 distant from the Tail. What is sought is the distance of its parallel from the Tail, since the difference in longitude is 1\u00b0 45\u2019. Dividing the secant of 8\u00b0 17\u2019 by the secant of 1\u00b0 45\u2019 gives the secant of 8\u00b0 6\u2019, the arc sought. This subtracted from the fixed star\u2019s northern latitude of 12\u00b0 18\u2019 leaves Mars\u2019s latitude, 4\u00b0 12\u2019 north. This I now take as determined, and compare it with the latitudes of the fixed stars according to the laws of trigonometry. From the Wing of Virgo, I find Mars\u2019s longitude to be 14\u00b0 19\u2019 Virgo; from the Neck of Leo, 14\u00b0 23\u2019 36\u201c. The mean of these two is 14\u00b0 21\u2019 18\u201c Virgo. And since the sextant gave distances larger than the truth, the latitude would come out at 4\u00b0 14\u2019 north.\nOn the night following February 23, at 12h, he observed Mars in relation to five fixed stars: the Tail of Leo and Arcturus for latitude, and for the longitude, in the first instance, Spica (which followed it), and, in the second, the Neck of Leo and Cor Leonis (which preceded it).\nBy a rough estimate, I foresee that Mars is going to fall at 11\u00bc\u00b0 Virgo. It was found to be 9\u00b0 24\u2019 from the Tail of Leo, and hence, its latitude comes out at 4\u00b0 6\u2019 ^32. And now, through this and the latitudes of the fixed stars, together with their distances (17\u00b0 26\u2019 from Regulus, 17\u00b0 51\u2019 from the Neck of Leo, 37\u00b0 28\u2019 from Spica, 44\u00b0 15\u2019 from Arcturus), Mars\u2019s position comes out at 11\u00b0 21\u2019 23\u201c Virgo (from Regulus), 11\u00b0 20\u2019 52\u201c Virgo (from the Neck of Leo), and 11\u00b0 17\u2019 40\u201c (from Spica). Again (as you see) the distances err in being too great. For from the Heart and the Neck [of Leo], Mars is pushed a little eastward, and from Spica and Arcturus a little westward, and more from Arcturus, owing to its greater northern latitude ^33. The mean (ignoring Arcturus), 11\u00b0 19\u2019 20\u201c Virgo, is very nearly true. Also, the latitude is greater, namely, 4\u00b0 7\u2019 40\u201c north. Now from February 15 at 17h to 23 February at 12h, a period of 7 days 19 hours, Mars moved 3\u00b0 0\u2019: 180 minutes in 187 hours. That is, about one minute per hour. And if you wish to take it into account, the parallax (if any) is subtracted from the longitude on February 16 and a little is added on February 23.\n Because the last observation follows the time of observation found by me by 2 days 21 hours 47 min., add the motion corresponding to this time, 1\u00b0 7\u2019: the position will come out 12\u00b0 26\u2019 Virgo. The agreement is thus very good\u2014it could not be better\u2014given that both of us [that is, Kepler and Fabricius] work independently and do not rely on the facilities used by Tycho Brahe.","1728":"VIII. On 1595 October 30 at 8h 20m, the planet was found at 17\u00b0 47\u2019 15\u201c Taurus,19 not far from the nonagesimal. We may thus be sure of the parallax, although we must take it into account. The latitude was 0\u00b0 5\u2019 10\u201c north. The sun\u2019s position was 16\u00b0 50\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio. The distance between the stars was 56\u2019 45\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 35\u201c; that of Mars, 22\u2019 54\u201c, as appears by comparing the nearby observations. The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 23\u2019 29\u201c. If the distance between the stars be divided by this, it comes out to 40\u2019 47\u201c of a day, or 16 hours 19 min. Therefore, the true opposition was 0h 39m PM on October 31. Mars\u2019s position was 17\u00b0 31\u2019 40\u201c Taurus. This needs no reduction to the orbit, as it is nearly at the node. The latitude was about 0\u00b0 8\u2019 north. But comparison with the preceding and following days shows a latitude of about 5\u2019 north.\nIX. Let, at any rate, Mars\u2019s position on 1597 December 10 at 8h 30m be 3\u00b0 45\u00bd\u2019 Cancer (as above) ^20. The sun\u2019s position was 29\u00b0 4\u2019 53\u201c Sagittarius. The distance between the stars was 4\u00b0 40\u2019 37\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 61\u2019 20\u201c, that of Mars 23\u2019 40\u201c (for in 1580 the diurnal motion in Gemini was 23\u2019, and in 1582, at 17\u00b0 Cancer, it was 24\u2019). Therefore, the sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 25\u2019 0\u201c. These data show that the time of true opposition followed 3 days 7 hours 14 min. later, on December 14 at 3h 44m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 2\u00b0 27\u2153\u2019 Cancer. The reduction to the orbit (quite ridiculous here, since the observation itself has an uncertainty of several minutes) requires the addition of about 52\u201c. Therefore, the corrected position was 2\u00b0 28\u2019 Cancer. The latitude, from the table, was 3\u00b0 33\u2019 north.\nOn the same night, the one following December 10, at 12\u2159h, Fabricius in East Frisia found Mars\u2019s position to be 3\u00b0 40\u00bc\u2019 Cancer with latitude 3\u00b0 23\u2019 N. In this observation the longitude comes out nearly the same. For the motion over 3h 40m is 3\u00bd\u2019, so that in the Brahean observation too, at 12\u2159h Mars could have been at 3\u00b0 42\u2019 Cancer\u2014two minutes beyond the Fabrician position.\nX. On 1600 January 13\/23 at 11h 40m, the time being adjusted to Uraniborg time, the planet was observed at 10\u00b0 38\u2019 46\u201c Leo ^21. The sun\u2019s position was 3\u00b0 26\u2019 30\u201c Aquarius. The stars were 7\u00b0 12\u2019 16\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion for the next few days was 1\u00b0 1\u2019 3\u201c; that of Mars, 23\u2019 44\u201c. The sum: 1\u00b0 24\u2019 47\u201c. The opposition therefore followed 5 days 2h 22m after; that is, on January 19\/29 at 2h 2m in the morning, before dawn. Mars was at 8\u00b0 38\u2019 Leo. There is no need for reduction, since it is near the limit. The latitude, from the table, was 4\u00b0 30\u2019 50\u201c N.\nXI. On the evening of 1602 Febr. 18\/28 at 10h 30m, using the Tychonic  instruments (with the help of the learned Matthias Seiffard,22 bequeathed us by Tycho), I took the distance of Mars from the middle star of the tail of Ursa Major 23 to be 52\u00b0 22\u2019. And since the distance between Cor Leonis and Procyon was 37\u00b0 22\u2019 20\u201c, which should have been 37\u00b0 19\u2019 50\u201c,24 we know that the sextant reads 2\u00bd minutes high. Therefore, the corrected distance of Mars from the tail of Ursa was 52\u00b0 19\u00bd\u2019. And since the latitude of the fixed star is 56\u00b0 22\u2019, the remainder, by subtraction, is 4\u00b0 2\u00bd\u2019\u2014supposing that Mars was at precisely the same longitude as the fixed star. But because there was a difference of 3\u00be degrees between them (as is clear from the following observations), a slight correction is required.\n For let AB be 3\u00b0 43\u2019 30\u201c on a parallel close to the ecliptic, B Mars, C the fixed star, and BC 52\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c. Dividing the secant of BC by the secant of AB gives the  secant of CA, 52\u00b0 14\u2019, which, subtracted from 56\u00b0 22\u2019 (the latitude of the fixed star) leaves 4\u00b0 8\u2019 north as Mars\u2019s observed latitude. At the same time, we found 19\u00b0 23\u2019 between Mars and Cor Leonis (19\u00b0 20\u00bd corrected), and 21\u00b0 20\u2019 between Mars and the bright star in the wing of Virgo25 (21\u00b0 17\u00bd\u2019 corrected). From these two distances (using the latitudes of the stars and Mars), Mars\u2019s longitude is found to be 13\u00b0 19\u2019 6\u201c Virgo, by consensus of all measurements.\nAlternatively, the meridian altitude of Mars was found at 12h 40m, using two quadrants, to be 50\u00b0 19\u2019, while the tail of Leo26 was 56\u00b0 45\u2019. Therefore, from the declinations and right ascensions of the fixed stars and our distances, Mars\u2019s position is determined as 13\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c Virgo, latitude 4\u00b0 7\u2019 55\u201c ^27. This is the Tychonic procedure. I have included the other for the sake of showing a consensus, and also that it might be evident that despite the lack of absolute perfection in the demonstration, short cuts either in computation or in our understanding can under certain circumstances be applied. For in that previous procedure there is less in the actual work than in the reporting of it. At Prague, 5\u00b0 Scorpio was rising ^28. Therefore, the nonagesimal was about 32\u00bd\u00b0 from the zenith. And since Mars\u2019s distance from the earth was rather more than half the sun\u2019s distance, the resulting parallax of about 5\u2019 opposite 32\u00bd\u00b0 in our parallactic table, shows a latitudinal parallax of 2\u2019 41\u201c. Thus the latitude as seen from the middle of the earth would be 4\u00b0 10\u2154\u2019 north. And because the altitude of the nonagesimal was 57\u00bd\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax at the horizon was 4\u2019 13\u201c. But since Mars was 38\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, the longitudinal parallax corresponding to this position is 2\u2019 36\u201c, and if this be eliminated, Mars would be placed at about 13\u00b0 18\u2019 Virgo ^29. At that moment, the sun\u2019s position was 10\u00b0 16\u2019 42\u201c Pisces. The distance between the bodies was 3\u00b0 1\u2019 18\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 4\u201c, and that of Mars, 24\u2019 5\u201c (for it was 24\u2019 18\u201c at 21\u00b0 Leo in 1585, and 24\u2019 at 26 Virgo in 1587). The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 24\u2019 9\u201c. The true opposition therefore followed 2 days 3 hours 43 minutes later, on 21 February\/3 March before dawn at 2h 13m, Mars being at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 35\u201c Virgo. Forty seconds must be subtracted to reduce the position to the orbit, putting Mars at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 Virgo, with slightly less latitude than before, since the latitude was then decreasing. It was therefore about 4\u00b0 10\u2019, or 4\u00b0 7\u2153\u2019 if the parallax be neglected.\n But because, since Tycho\u2019s death, we have not made frequent observations nor continued them over several days, it would be best, for certainty\u2019s sake, also to make use of those observations which David Fabricius of East Frisia, a sedulous practitioner of astronomy, has communicated to me.\nOn February 16, old style, at 5h in the morning, he took the planet\u2019s distances from the tail of Leo (for the latitude), from the neck of Leo,30 and, on the other hand, from the bright star in the southern wing of Virgo, so as to check its longitude by working it out twice.\nI could make use of Tycho\u2019s line of reasoning, which he routinely adopted in volume I of the Progymnasmata when (as here) the declination of the planet was not known. But because that method extends to ten operations, I prefer for the sake of brevity to proceed as I did before with my own observations. Here there are no hidden dangers.\nFirst, the star in the wing of Virgo, adjusted to our time, is at 4\u00b0 36\u2019 30\u201c Libra with latitude 2\u00b0 50\u2019 north. Fabricius found that Mars is 20\u00b0 18\u2019 westward from it on the zodiac, which puts Mars at about 14\u00b0 18\u2019 30\u201c Virgo. This is a preliminary, approximate figure: the longitude will shortly be corrected. Now the tail of Leo31 is at 16\u00b0 4\u2019 Virgo, with latitude 12\u00b0 18\u2019 North, and Mars was found to be 8\u00b0 17\u2019 distant from the Tail. What is sought is the distance of its parallel from the Tail, since the difference in longitude is 1\u00b0 45\u2019. Dividing the secant of 8\u00b0 17\u2019 by the secant of 1\u00b0 45\u2019 gives the secant of 8\u00b0 6\u2019, the arc sought. This subtracted from the fixed star\u2019s northern latitude of 12\u00b0 18\u2019 leaves Mars\u2019s latitude, 4\u00b0 12\u2019 north. This I now take as determined, and compare it with the latitudes of the fixed stars according to the laws of trigonometry. From the Wing of Virgo, I find Mars\u2019s longitude to be 14\u00b0 19\u2019 Virgo; from the Neck of Leo, 14\u00b0 23\u2019 36\u201c. The mean of these two is 14\u00b0 21\u2019 18\u201c Virgo. And since the sextant gave distances larger than the truth, the latitude would come out at 4\u00b0 14\u2019 north.\nOn the night following February 23, at 12h, he observed Mars in relation to five fixed stars: the Tail of Leo and Arcturus for latitude, and for the longitude, in the first instance, Spica (which followed it), and, in the second, the Neck of Leo and Cor Leonis (which preceded it).\nBy a rough estimate, I foresee that Mars is going to fall at 11\u00bc\u00b0 Virgo. It was found to be 9\u00b0 24\u2019 from the Tail of Leo, and hence, its latitude comes out at 4\u00b0 6\u2019 ^32. And now, through this and the latitudes of the fixed stars, together with their distances (17\u00b0 26\u2019 from Regulus, 17\u00b0 51\u2019 from the Neck of Leo, 37\u00b0 28\u2019 from Spica, 44\u00b0 15\u2019 from Arcturus), Mars\u2019s position comes out at 11\u00b0 21\u2019 23\u201c Virgo (from Regulus), 11\u00b0 20\u2019 52\u201c Virgo (from the Neck of Leo), and 11\u00b0 17\u2019 40\u201c (from Spica). Again (as you see) the distances err in being too great. For from the Heart and the Neck [of Leo], Mars is pushed a little eastward, and from Spica and Arcturus a little westward, and more from Arcturus, owing to its greater northern latitude ^33. The mean (ignoring Arcturus), 11\u00b0 19\u2019 20\u201c Virgo, is very nearly true. Also, the latitude is greater, namely, 4\u00b0 7\u2019 40\u201c north. Now from February 15 at 17h to 23 February at 12h, a period of 7 days 19 hours, Mars moved 3\u00b0 0\u2019: 180 minutes in 187 hours. That is, about one minute per hour. And if you wish to take it into account, the parallax (if any) is subtracted from the longitude on February 16 and a little is added on February 23.\n Because the last observation follows the time of observation found by me by 2 days 21 hours 47 min., add the motion corresponding to this time, 1\u00b0 7\u2019: the position will come out 12\u00b0 26\u2019 Virgo. The agreement is thus very good\u2014it could not be better\u2014given that both of us [that is, Kepler and Fabricius] work independently and do not rely on the facilities used by Tycho Brahe.","1729":"VIII. On 1595 October 30 at 8h 20m, the planet was found at 17\u00b0 47\u2019 15\u201c Taurus,19 not far from the nonagesimal. We may thus be sure of the parallax, although we must take it into account. The latitude was 0\u00b0 5\u2019 10\u201c north. The sun\u2019s position was 16\u00b0 50\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio. The distance between the stars was 56\u2019 45\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 35\u201c; that of Mars, 22\u2019 54\u201c, as appears by comparing the nearby observations. The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 23\u2019 29\u201c. If the distance between the stars be divided by this, it comes out to 40\u2019 47\u201c of a day, or 16 hours 19 min. Therefore, the true opposition was 0h 39m PM on October 31. Mars\u2019s position was 17\u00b0 31\u2019 40\u201c Taurus. This needs no reduction to the orbit, as it is nearly at the node. The latitude was about 0\u00b0 8\u2019 north. But comparison with the preceding and following days shows a latitude of about 5\u2019 north.\nIX. Let, at any rate, Mars\u2019s position on 1597 December 10 at 8h 30m be 3\u00b0 45\u00bd\u2019 Cancer (as above) ^20. The sun\u2019s position was 29\u00b0 4\u2019 53\u201c Sagittarius. The distance between the stars was 4\u00b0 40\u2019 37\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 61\u2019 20\u201c, that of Mars 23\u2019 40\u201c (for in 1580 the diurnal motion in Gemini was 23\u2019, and in 1582, at 17\u00b0 Cancer, it was 24\u2019). Therefore, the sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 25\u2019 0\u201c. These data show that the time of true opposition followed 3 days 7 hours 14 min. later, on December 14 at 3h 44m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 2\u00b0 27\u2153\u2019 Cancer. The reduction to the orbit (quite ridiculous here, since the observation itself has an uncertainty of several minutes) requires the addition of about 52\u201c. Therefore, the corrected position was 2\u00b0 28\u2019 Cancer. The latitude, from the table, was 3\u00b0 33\u2019 north.\nOn the same night, the one following December 10, at 12\u2159h, Fabricius in East Frisia found Mars\u2019s position to be 3\u00b0 40\u00bc\u2019 Cancer with latitude 3\u00b0 23\u2019 N. In this observation the longitude comes out nearly the same. For the motion over 3h 40m is 3\u00bd\u2019, so that in the Brahean observation too, at 12\u2159h Mars could have been at 3\u00b0 42\u2019 Cancer\u2014two minutes beyond the Fabrician position.\nX. On 1600 January 13\/23 at 11h 40m, the time being adjusted to Uraniborg time, the planet was observed at 10\u00b0 38\u2019 46\u201c Leo ^21. The sun\u2019s position was 3\u00b0 26\u2019 30\u201c Aquarius. The stars were 7\u00b0 12\u2019 16\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion for the next few days was 1\u00b0 1\u2019 3\u201c; that of Mars, 23\u2019 44\u201c. The sum: 1\u00b0 24\u2019 47\u201c. The opposition therefore followed 5 days 2h 22m after; that is, on January 19\/29 at 2h 2m in the morning, before dawn. Mars was at 8\u00b0 38\u2019 Leo. There is no need for reduction, since it is near the limit. The latitude, from the table, was 4\u00b0 30\u2019 50\u201c N.\nXI. On the evening of 1602 Febr. 18\/28 at 10h 30m, using the Tychonic  instruments (with the help of the learned Matthias Seiffard,22 bequeathed us by Tycho), I took the distance of Mars from the middle star of the tail of Ursa Major 23 to be 52\u00b0 22\u2019. And since the distance between Cor Leonis and Procyon was 37\u00b0 22\u2019 20\u201c, which should have been 37\u00b0 19\u2019 50\u201c,24 we know that the sextant reads 2\u00bd minutes high. Therefore, the corrected distance of Mars from the tail of Ursa was 52\u00b0 19\u00bd\u2019. And since the latitude of the fixed star is 56\u00b0 22\u2019, the remainder, by subtraction, is 4\u00b0 2\u00bd\u2019\u2014supposing that Mars was at precisely the same longitude as the fixed star. But because there was a difference of 3\u00be degrees between them (as is clear from the following observations), a slight correction is required.\n For let AB be 3\u00b0 43\u2019 30\u201c on a parallel close to the ecliptic, B Mars, C the fixed star, and BC 52\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c. Dividing the secant of BC by the secant of AB gives the  secant of CA, 52\u00b0 14\u2019, which, subtracted from 56\u00b0 22\u2019 (the latitude of the fixed star) leaves 4\u00b0 8\u2019 north as Mars\u2019s observed latitude. At the same time, we found 19\u00b0 23\u2019 between Mars and Cor Leonis (19\u00b0 20\u00bd corrected), and 21\u00b0 20\u2019 between Mars and the bright star in the wing of Virgo25 (21\u00b0 17\u00bd\u2019 corrected). From these two distances (using the latitudes of the stars and Mars), Mars\u2019s longitude is found to be 13\u00b0 19\u2019 6\u201c Virgo, by consensus of all measurements.\nAlternatively, the meridian altitude of Mars was found at 12h 40m, using two quadrants, to be 50\u00b0 19\u2019, while the tail of Leo26 was 56\u00b0 45\u2019. Therefore, from the declinations and right ascensions of the fixed stars and our distances, Mars\u2019s position is determined as 13\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c Virgo, latitude 4\u00b0 7\u2019 55\u201c ^27. This is the Tychonic procedure. I have included the other for the sake of showing a consensus, and also that it might be evident that despite the lack of absolute perfection in the demonstration, short cuts either in computation or in our understanding can under certain circumstances be applied. For in that previous procedure there is less in the actual work than in the reporting of it. At Prague, 5\u00b0 Scorpio was rising ^28. Therefore, the nonagesimal was about 32\u00bd\u00b0 from the zenith. And since Mars\u2019s distance from the earth was rather more than half the sun\u2019s distance, the resulting parallax of about 5\u2019 opposite 32\u00bd\u00b0 in our parallactic table, shows a latitudinal parallax of 2\u2019 41\u201c. Thus the latitude as seen from the middle of the earth would be 4\u00b0 10\u2154\u2019 north. And because the altitude of the nonagesimal was 57\u00bd\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax at the horizon was 4\u2019 13\u201c. But since Mars was 38\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, the longitudinal parallax corresponding to this position is 2\u2019 36\u201c, and if this be eliminated, Mars would be placed at about 13\u00b0 18\u2019 Virgo ^29. At that moment, the sun\u2019s position was 10\u00b0 16\u2019 42\u201c Pisces. The distance between the bodies was 3\u00b0 1\u2019 18\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 4\u201c, and that of Mars, 24\u2019 5\u201c (for it was 24\u2019 18\u201c at 21\u00b0 Leo in 1585, and 24\u2019 at 26 Virgo in 1587). The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 24\u2019 9\u201c. The true opposition therefore followed 2 days 3 hours 43 minutes later, on 21 February\/3 March before dawn at 2h 13m, Mars being at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 35\u201c Virgo. Forty seconds must be subtracted to reduce the position to the orbit, putting Mars at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 Virgo, with slightly less latitude than before, since the latitude was then decreasing. It was therefore about 4\u00b0 10\u2019, or 4\u00b0 7\u2153\u2019 if the parallax be neglected.\n But because, since Tycho\u2019s death, we have not made frequent observations nor continued them over several days, it would be best, for certainty\u2019s sake, also to make use of those observations which David Fabricius of East Frisia, a sedulous practitioner of astronomy, has communicated to me.\nOn February 16, old style, at 5h in the morning, he took the planet\u2019s distances from the tail of Leo (for the latitude), from the neck of Leo,30 and, on the other hand, from the bright star in the southern wing of Virgo, so as to check its longitude by working it out twice.\nI could make use of Tycho\u2019s line of reasoning, which he routinely adopted in volume I of the Progymnasmata when (as here) the declination of the planet was not known. But because that method extends to ten operations, I prefer for the sake of brevity to proceed as I did before with my own observations. Here there are no hidden dangers.\nFirst, the star in the wing of Virgo, adjusted to our time, is at 4\u00b0 36\u2019 30\u201c Libra with latitude 2\u00b0 50\u2019 north. Fabricius found that Mars is 20\u00b0 18\u2019 westward from it on the zodiac, which puts Mars at about 14\u00b0 18\u2019 30\u201c Virgo. This is a preliminary, approximate figure: the longitude will shortly be corrected. Now the tail of Leo31 is at 16\u00b0 4\u2019 Virgo, with latitude 12\u00b0 18\u2019 North, and Mars was found to be 8\u00b0 17\u2019 distant from the Tail. What is sought is the distance of its parallel from the Tail, since the difference in longitude is 1\u00b0 45\u2019. Dividing the secant of 8\u00b0 17\u2019 by the secant of 1\u00b0 45\u2019 gives the secant of 8\u00b0 6\u2019, the arc sought. This subtracted from the fixed star\u2019s northern latitude of 12\u00b0 18\u2019 leaves Mars\u2019s latitude, 4\u00b0 12\u2019 north. This I now take as determined, and compare it with the latitudes of the fixed stars according to the laws of trigonometry. From the Wing of Virgo, I find Mars\u2019s longitude to be 14\u00b0 19\u2019 Virgo; from the Neck of Leo, 14\u00b0 23\u2019 36\u201c. The mean of these two is 14\u00b0 21\u2019 18\u201c Virgo. And since the sextant gave distances larger than the truth, the latitude would come out at 4\u00b0 14\u2019 north.\nOn the night following February 23, at 12h, he observed Mars in relation to five fixed stars: the Tail of Leo and Arcturus for latitude, and for the longitude, in the first instance, Spica (which followed it), and, in the second, the Neck of Leo and Cor Leonis (which preceded it).\nBy a rough estimate, I foresee that Mars is going to fall at 11\u00bc\u00b0 Virgo. It was found to be 9\u00b0 24\u2019 from the Tail of Leo, and hence, its latitude comes out at 4\u00b0 6\u2019 ^32. And now, through this and the latitudes of the fixed stars, together with their distances (17\u00b0 26\u2019 from Regulus, 17\u00b0 51\u2019 from the Neck of Leo, 37\u00b0 28\u2019 from Spica, 44\u00b0 15\u2019 from Arcturus), Mars\u2019s position comes out at 11\u00b0 21\u2019 23\u201c Virgo (from Regulus), 11\u00b0 20\u2019 52\u201c Virgo (from the Neck of Leo), and 11\u00b0 17\u2019 40\u201c (from Spica). Again (as you see) the distances err in being too great. For from the Heart and the Neck [of Leo], Mars is pushed a little eastward, and from Spica and Arcturus a little westward, and more from Arcturus, owing to its greater northern latitude ^33. The mean (ignoring Arcturus), 11\u00b0 19\u2019 20\u201c Virgo, is very nearly true. Also, the latitude is greater, namely, 4\u00b0 7\u2019 40\u201c north. Now from February 15 at 17h to 23 February at 12h, a period of 7 days 19 hours, Mars moved 3\u00b0 0\u2019: 180 minutes in 187 hours. That is, about one minute per hour. And if you wish to take it into account, the parallax (if any) is subtracted from the longitude on February 16 and a little is added on February 23.\n Because the last observation follows the time of observation found by me by 2 days 21 hours 47 min., add the motion corresponding to this time, 1\u00b0 7\u2019: the position will come out 12\u00b0 26\u2019 Virgo. The agreement is thus very good\u2014it could not be better\u2014given that both of us [that is, Kepler and Fabricius] work independently and do not rely on the facilities used by Tycho Brahe.","1730":"VIII. On 1595 October 30 at 8h 20m, the planet was found at 17\u00b0 47\u2019 15\u201c Taurus,19 not far from the nonagesimal. We may thus be sure of the parallax, although we must take it into account. The latitude was 0\u00b0 5\u2019 10\u201c north. The sun\u2019s position was 16\u00b0 50\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio. The distance between the stars was 56\u2019 45\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 35\u201c; that of Mars, 22\u2019 54\u201c, as appears by comparing the nearby observations. The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 23\u2019 29\u201c. If the distance between the stars be divided by this, it comes out to 40\u2019 47\u201c of a day, or 16 hours 19 min. Therefore, the true opposition was 0h 39m PM on October 31. Mars\u2019s position was 17\u00b0 31\u2019 40\u201c Taurus. This needs no reduction to the orbit, as it is nearly at the node. The latitude was about 0\u00b0 8\u2019 north. But comparison with the preceding and following days shows a latitude of about 5\u2019 north.\nIX. Let, at any rate, Mars\u2019s position on 1597 December 10 at 8h 30m be 3\u00b0 45\u00bd\u2019 Cancer (as above) ^20. The sun\u2019s position was 29\u00b0 4\u2019 53\u201c Sagittarius. The distance between the stars was 4\u00b0 40\u2019 37\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 61\u2019 20\u201c, that of Mars 23\u2019 40\u201c (for in 1580 the diurnal motion in Gemini was 23\u2019, and in 1582, at 17\u00b0 Cancer, it was 24\u2019). Therefore, the sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 25\u2019 0\u201c. These data show that the time of true opposition followed 3 days 7 hours 14 min. later, on December 14 at 3h 44m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 2\u00b0 27\u2153\u2019 Cancer. The reduction to the orbit (quite ridiculous here, since the observation itself has an uncertainty of several minutes) requires the addition of about 52\u201c. Therefore, the corrected position was 2\u00b0 28\u2019 Cancer. The latitude, from the table, was 3\u00b0 33\u2019 north.\nOn the same night, the one following December 10, at 12\u2159h, Fabricius in East Frisia found Mars\u2019s position to be 3\u00b0 40\u00bc\u2019 Cancer with latitude 3\u00b0 23\u2019 N. In this observation the longitude comes out nearly the same. For the motion over 3h 40m is 3\u00bd\u2019, so that in the Brahean observation too, at 12\u2159h Mars could have been at 3\u00b0 42\u2019 Cancer\u2014two minutes beyond the Fabrician position.\nX. On 1600 January 13\/23 at 11h 40m, the time being adjusted to Uraniborg time, the planet was observed at 10\u00b0 38\u2019 46\u201c Leo ^21. The sun\u2019s position was 3\u00b0 26\u2019 30\u201c Aquarius. The stars were 7\u00b0 12\u2019 16\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion for the next few days was 1\u00b0 1\u2019 3\u201c; that of Mars, 23\u2019 44\u201c. The sum: 1\u00b0 24\u2019 47\u201c. The opposition therefore followed 5 days 2h 22m after; that is, on January 19\/29 at 2h 2m in the morning, before dawn. Mars was at 8\u00b0 38\u2019 Leo. There is no need for reduction, since it is near the limit. The latitude, from the table, was 4\u00b0 30\u2019 50\u201c N.\nXI. On the evening of 1602 Febr. 18\/28 at 10h 30m, using the Tychonic  instruments (with the help of the learned Matthias Seiffard,22 bequeathed us by Tycho), I took the distance of Mars from the middle star of the tail of Ursa Major 23 to be 52\u00b0 22\u2019. And since the distance between Cor Leonis and Procyon was 37\u00b0 22\u2019 20\u201c, which should have been 37\u00b0 19\u2019 50\u201c,24 we know that the sextant reads 2\u00bd minutes high. Therefore, the corrected distance of Mars from the tail of Ursa was 52\u00b0 19\u00bd\u2019. And since the latitude of the fixed star is 56\u00b0 22\u2019, the remainder, by subtraction, is 4\u00b0 2\u00bd\u2019\u2014supposing that Mars was at precisely the same longitude as the fixed star. But because there was a difference of 3\u00be degrees between them (as is clear from the following observations), a slight correction is required.\n For let AB be 3\u00b0 43\u2019 30\u201c on a parallel close to the ecliptic, B Mars, C the fixed star, and BC 52\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c. Dividing the secant of BC by the secant of AB gives the  secant of CA, 52\u00b0 14\u2019, which, subtracted from 56\u00b0 22\u2019 (the latitude of the fixed star) leaves 4\u00b0 8\u2019 north as Mars\u2019s observed latitude. At the same time, we found 19\u00b0 23\u2019 between Mars and Cor Leonis (19\u00b0 20\u00bd corrected), and 21\u00b0 20\u2019 between Mars and the bright star in the wing of Virgo25 (21\u00b0 17\u00bd\u2019 corrected). From these two distances (using the latitudes of the stars and Mars), Mars\u2019s longitude is found to be 13\u00b0 19\u2019 6\u201c Virgo, by consensus of all measurements.\nAlternatively, the meridian altitude of Mars was found at 12h 40m, using two quadrants, to be 50\u00b0 19\u2019, while the tail of Leo26 was 56\u00b0 45\u2019. Therefore, from the declinations and right ascensions of the fixed stars and our distances, Mars\u2019s position is determined as 13\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c Virgo, latitude 4\u00b0 7\u2019 55\u201c ^27. This is the Tychonic procedure. I have included the other for the sake of showing a consensus, and also that it might be evident that despite the lack of absolute perfection in the demonstration, short cuts either in computation or in our understanding can under certain circumstances be applied. For in that previous procedure there is less in the actual work than in the reporting of it. At Prague, 5\u00b0 Scorpio was rising ^28. Therefore, the nonagesimal was about 32\u00bd\u00b0 from the zenith. And since Mars\u2019s distance from the earth was rather more than half the sun\u2019s distance, the resulting parallax of about 5\u2019 opposite 32\u00bd\u00b0 in our parallactic table, shows a latitudinal parallax of 2\u2019 41\u201c. Thus the latitude as seen from the middle of the earth would be 4\u00b0 10\u2154\u2019 north. And because the altitude of the nonagesimal was 57\u00bd\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax at the horizon was 4\u2019 13\u201c. But since Mars was 38\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, the longitudinal parallax corresponding to this position is 2\u2019 36\u201c, and if this be eliminated, Mars would be placed at about 13\u00b0 18\u2019 Virgo ^29. At that moment, the sun\u2019s position was 10\u00b0 16\u2019 42\u201c Pisces. The distance between the bodies was 3\u00b0 1\u2019 18\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 4\u201c, and that of Mars, 24\u2019 5\u201c (for it was 24\u2019 18\u201c at 21\u00b0 Leo in 1585, and 24\u2019 at 26 Virgo in 1587). The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 24\u2019 9\u201c. The true opposition therefore followed 2 days 3 hours 43 minutes later, on 21 February\/3 March before dawn at 2h 13m, Mars being at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 35\u201c Virgo. Forty seconds must be subtracted to reduce the position to the orbit, putting Mars at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 Virgo, with slightly less latitude than before, since the latitude was then decreasing. It was therefore about 4\u00b0 10\u2019, or 4\u00b0 7\u2153\u2019 if the parallax be neglected.\n But because, since Tycho\u2019s death, we have not made frequent observations nor continued them over several days, it would be best, for certainty\u2019s sake, also to make use of those observations which David Fabricius of East Frisia, a sedulous practitioner of astronomy, has communicated to me.\nOn February 16, old style, at 5h in the morning, he took the planet\u2019s distances from the tail of Leo (for the latitude), from the neck of Leo,30 and, on the other hand, from the bright star in the southern wing of Virgo, so as to check its longitude by working it out twice.\nI could make use of Tycho\u2019s line of reasoning, which he routinely adopted in volume I of the Progymnasmata when (as here) the declination of the planet was not known. But because that method extends to ten operations, I prefer for the sake of brevity to proceed as I did before with my own observations. Here there are no hidden dangers.\nFirst, the star in the wing of Virgo, adjusted to our time, is at 4\u00b0 36\u2019 30\u201c Libra with latitude 2\u00b0 50\u2019 north. Fabricius found that Mars is 20\u00b0 18\u2019 westward from it on the zodiac, which puts Mars at about 14\u00b0 18\u2019 30\u201c Virgo. This is a preliminary, approximate figure: the longitude will shortly be corrected. Now the tail of Leo31 is at 16\u00b0 4\u2019 Virgo, with latitude 12\u00b0 18\u2019 North, and Mars was found to be 8\u00b0 17\u2019 distant from the Tail. What is sought is the distance of its parallel from the Tail, since the difference in longitude is 1\u00b0 45\u2019. Dividing the secant of 8\u00b0 17\u2019 by the secant of 1\u00b0 45\u2019 gives the secant of 8\u00b0 6\u2019, the arc sought. This subtracted from the fixed star\u2019s northern latitude of 12\u00b0 18\u2019 leaves Mars\u2019s latitude, 4\u00b0 12\u2019 north. This I now take as determined, and compare it with the latitudes of the fixed stars according to the laws of trigonometry. From the Wing of Virgo, I find Mars\u2019s longitude to be 14\u00b0 19\u2019 Virgo; from the Neck of Leo, 14\u00b0 23\u2019 36\u201c. The mean of these two is 14\u00b0 21\u2019 18\u201c Virgo. And since the sextant gave distances larger than the truth, the latitude would come out at 4\u00b0 14\u2019 north.\nOn the night following February 23, at 12h, he observed Mars in relation to five fixed stars: the Tail of Leo and Arcturus for latitude, and for the longitude, in the first instance, Spica (which followed it), and, in the second, the Neck of Leo and Cor Leonis (which preceded it).\nBy a rough estimate, I foresee that Mars is going to fall at 11\u00bc\u00b0 Virgo. It was found to be 9\u00b0 24\u2019 from the Tail of Leo, and hence, its latitude comes out at 4\u00b0 6\u2019 ^32. And now, through this and the latitudes of the fixed stars, together with their distances (17\u00b0 26\u2019 from Regulus, 17\u00b0 51\u2019 from the Neck of Leo, 37\u00b0 28\u2019 from Spica, 44\u00b0 15\u2019 from Arcturus), Mars\u2019s position comes out at 11\u00b0 21\u2019 23\u201c Virgo (from Regulus), 11\u00b0 20\u2019 52\u201c Virgo (from the Neck of Leo), and 11\u00b0 17\u2019 40\u201c (from Spica). Again (as you see) the distances err in being too great. For from the Heart and the Neck [of Leo], Mars is pushed a little eastward, and from Spica and Arcturus a little westward, and more from Arcturus, owing to its greater northern latitude ^33. The mean (ignoring Arcturus), 11\u00b0 19\u2019 20\u201c Virgo, is very nearly true. Also, the latitude is greater, namely, 4\u00b0 7\u2019 40\u201c north. Now from February 15 at 17h to 23 February at 12h, a period of 7 days 19 hours, Mars moved 3\u00b0 0\u2019: 180 minutes in 187 hours. That is, about one minute per hour. And if you wish to take it into account, the parallax (if any) is subtracted from the longitude on February 16 and a little is added on February 23.\n Because the last observation follows the time of observation found by me by 2 days 21 hours 47 min., add the motion corresponding to this time, 1\u00b0 7\u2019: the position will come out 12\u00b0 26\u2019 Virgo. The agreement is thus very good\u2014it could not be better\u2014given that both of us [that is, Kepler and Fabricius] work independently and do not rely on the facilities used by Tycho Brahe.","1731":"VIII. On 1595 October 30 at 8h 20m, the planet was found at 17\u00b0 47\u2019 15\u201c Taurus,19 not far from the nonagesimal. We may thus be sure of the parallax, although we must take it into account. The latitude was 0\u00b0 5\u2019 10\u201c north. The sun\u2019s position was 16\u00b0 50\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio. The distance between the stars was 56\u2019 45\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 35\u201c; that of Mars, 22\u2019 54\u201c, as appears by comparing the nearby observations. The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 23\u2019 29\u201c. If the distance between the stars be divided by this, it comes out to 40\u2019 47\u201c of a day, or 16 hours 19 min. Therefore, the true opposition was 0h 39m PM on October 31. Mars\u2019s position was 17\u00b0 31\u2019 40\u201c Taurus. This needs no reduction to the orbit, as it is nearly at the node. The latitude was about 0\u00b0 8\u2019 north. But comparison with the preceding and following days shows a latitude of about 5\u2019 north.\nIX. Let, at any rate, Mars\u2019s position on 1597 December 10 at 8h 30m be 3\u00b0 45\u00bd\u2019 Cancer (as above) ^20. The sun\u2019s position was 29\u00b0 4\u2019 53\u201c Sagittarius. The distance between the stars was 4\u00b0 40\u2019 37\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 61\u2019 20\u201c, that of Mars 23\u2019 40\u201c (for in 1580 the diurnal motion in Gemini was 23\u2019, and in 1582, at 17\u00b0 Cancer, it was 24\u2019). Therefore, the sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 25\u2019 0\u201c. These data show that the time of true opposition followed 3 days 7 hours 14 min. later, on December 14 at 3h 44m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 2\u00b0 27\u2153\u2019 Cancer. The reduction to the orbit (quite ridiculous here, since the observation itself has an uncertainty of several minutes) requires the addition of about 52\u201c. Therefore, the corrected position was 2\u00b0 28\u2019 Cancer. The latitude, from the table, was 3\u00b0 33\u2019 north.\nOn the same night, the one following December 10, at 12\u2159h, Fabricius in East Frisia found Mars\u2019s position to be 3\u00b0 40\u00bc\u2019 Cancer with latitude 3\u00b0 23\u2019 N. In this observation the longitude comes out nearly the same. For the motion over 3h 40m is 3\u00bd\u2019, so that in the Brahean observation too, at 12\u2159h Mars could have been at 3\u00b0 42\u2019 Cancer\u2014two minutes beyond the Fabrician position.\nX. On 1600 January 13\/23 at 11h 40m, the time being adjusted to Uraniborg time, the planet was observed at 10\u00b0 38\u2019 46\u201c Leo ^21. The sun\u2019s position was 3\u00b0 26\u2019 30\u201c Aquarius. The stars were 7\u00b0 12\u2019 16\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion for the next few days was 1\u00b0 1\u2019 3\u201c; that of Mars, 23\u2019 44\u201c. The sum: 1\u00b0 24\u2019 47\u201c. The opposition therefore followed 5 days 2h 22m after; that is, on January 19\/29 at 2h 2m in the morning, before dawn. Mars was at 8\u00b0 38\u2019 Leo. There is no need for reduction, since it is near the limit. The latitude, from the table, was 4\u00b0 30\u2019 50\u201c N.\nXI. On the evening of 1602 Febr. 18\/28 at 10h 30m, using the Tychonic  instruments (with the help of the learned Matthias Seiffard,22 bequeathed us by Tycho), I took the distance of Mars from the middle star of the tail of Ursa Major 23 to be 52\u00b0 22\u2019. And since the distance between Cor Leonis and Procyon was 37\u00b0 22\u2019 20\u201c, which should have been 37\u00b0 19\u2019 50\u201c,24 we know that the sextant reads 2\u00bd minutes high. Therefore, the corrected distance of Mars from the tail of Ursa was 52\u00b0 19\u00bd\u2019. And since the latitude of the fixed star is 56\u00b0 22\u2019, the remainder, by subtraction, is 4\u00b0 2\u00bd\u2019\u2014supposing that Mars was at precisely the same longitude as the fixed star. But because there was a difference of 3\u00be degrees between them (as is clear from the following observations), a slight correction is required.\n For let AB be 3\u00b0 43\u2019 30\u201c on a parallel close to the ecliptic, B Mars, C the fixed star, and BC 52\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c. Dividing the secant of BC by the secant of AB gives the  secant of CA, 52\u00b0 14\u2019, which, subtracted from 56\u00b0 22\u2019 (the latitude of the fixed star) leaves 4\u00b0 8\u2019 north as Mars\u2019s observed latitude. At the same time, we found 19\u00b0 23\u2019 between Mars and Cor Leonis (19\u00b0 20\u00bd corrected), and 21\u00b0 20\u2019 between Mars and the bright star in the wing of Virgo25 (21\u00b0 17\u00bd\u2019 corrected). From these two distances (using the latitudes of the stars and Mars), Mars\u2019s longitude is found to be 13\u00b0 19\u2019 6\u201c Virgo, by consensus of all measurements.\nAlternatively, the meridian altitude of Mars was found at 12h 40m, using two quadrants, to be 50\u00b0 19\u2019, while the tail of Leo26 was 56\u00b0 45\u2019. Therefore, from the declinations and right ascensions of the fixed stars and our distances, Mars\u2019s position is determined as 13\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c Virgo, latitude 4\u00b0 7\u2019 55\u201c ^27. This is the Tychonic procedure. I have included the other for the sake of showing a consensus, and also that it might be evident that despite the lack of absolute perfection in the demonstration, short cuts either in computation or in our understanding can under certain circumstances be applied. For in that previous procedure there is less in the actual work than in the reporting of it. At Prague, 5\u00b0 Scorpio was rising ^28. Therefore, the nonagesimal was about 32\u00bd\u00b0 from the zenith. And since Mars\u2019s distance from the earth was rather more than half the sun\u2019s distance, the resulting parallax of about 5\u2019 opposite 32\u00bd\u00b0 in our parallactic table, shows a latitudinal parallax of 2\u2019 41\u201c. Thus the latitude as seen from the middle of the earth would be 4\u00b0 10\u2154\u2019 north. And because the altitude of the nonagesimal was 57\u00bd\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax at the horizon was 4\u2019 13\u201c. But since Mars was 38\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, the longitudinal parallax corresponding to this position is 2\u2019 36\u201c, and if this be eliminated, Mars would be placed at about 13\u00b0 18\u2019 Virgo ^29. At that moment, the sun\u2019s position was 10\u00b0 16\u2019 42\u201c Pisces. The distance between the bodies was 3\u00b0 1\u2019 18\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 4\u201c, and that of Mars, 24\u2019 5\u201c (for it was 24\u2019 18\u201c at 21\u00b0 Leo in 1585, and 24\u2019 at 26 Virgo in 1587). The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 24\u2019 9\u201c. The true opposition therefore followed 2 days 3 hours 43 minutes later, on 21 February\/3 March before dawn at 2h 13m, Mars being at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 35\u201c Virgo. Forty seconds must be subtracted to reduce the position to the orbit, putting Mars at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 Virgo, with slightly less latitude than before, since the latitude was then decreasing. It was therefore about 4\u00b0 10\u2019, or 4\u00b0 7\u2153\u2019 if the parallax be neglected.\n But because, since Tycho\u2019s death, we have not made frequent observations nor continued them over several days, it would be best, for certainty\u2019s sake, also to make use of those observations which David Fabricius of East Frisia, a sedulous practitioner of astronomy, has communicated to me.\nOn February 16, old style, at 5h in the morning, he took the planet\u2019s distances from the tail of Leo (for the latitude), from the neck of Leo,30 and, on the other hand, from the bright star in the southern wing of Virgo, so as to check its longitude by working it out twice.\nI could make use of Tycho\u2019s line of reasoning, which he routinely adopted in volume I of the Progymnasmata when (as here) the declination of the planet was not known. But because that method extends to ten operations, I prefer for the sake of brevity to proceed as I did before with my own observations. Here there are no hidden dangers.\nFirst, the star in the wing of Virgo, adjusted to our time, is at 4\u00b0 36\u2019 30\u201c Libra with latitude 2\u00b0 50\u2019 north. Fabricius found that Mars is 20\u00b0 18\u2019 westward from it on the zodiac, which puts Mars at about 14\u00b0 18\u2019 30\u201c Virgo. This is a preliminary, approximate figure: the longitude will shortly be corrected. Now the tail of Leo31 is at 16\u00b0 4\u2019 Virgo, with latitude 12\u00b0 18\u2019 North, and Mars was found to be 8\u00b0 17\u2019 distant from the Tail. What is sought is the distance of its parallel from the Tail, since the difference in longitude is 1\u00b0 45\u2019. Dividing the secant of 8\u00b0 17\u2019 by the secant of 1\u00b0 45\u2019 gives the secant of 8\u00b0 6\u2019, the arc sought. This subtracted from the fixed star\u2019s northern latitude of 12\u00b0 18\u2019 leaves Mars\u2019s latitude, 4\u00b0 12\u2019 north. This I now take as determined, and compare it with the latitudes of the fixed stars according to the laws of trigonometry. From the Wing of Virgo, I find Mars\u2019s longitude to be 14\u00b0 19\u2019 Virgo; from the Neck of Leo, 14\u00b0 23\u2019 36\u201c. The mean of these two is 14\u00b0 21\u2019 18\u201c Virgo. And since the sextant gave distances larger than the truth, the latitude would come out at 4\u00b0 14\u2019 north.\nOn the night following February 23, at 12h, he observed Mars in relation to five fixed stars: the Tail of Leo and Arcturus for latitude, and for the longitude, in the first instance, Spica (which followed it), and, in the second, the Neck of Leo and Cor Leonis (which preceded it).\nBy a rough estimate, I foresee that Mars is going to fall at 11\u00bc\u00b0 Virgo. It was found to be 9\u00b0 24\u2019 from the Tail of Leo, and hence, its latitude comes out at 4\u00b0 6\u2019 ^32. And now, through this and the latitudes of the fixed stars, together with their distances (17\u00b0 26\u2019 from Regulus, 17\u00b0 51\u2019 from the Neck of Leo, 37\u00b0 28\u2019 from Spica, 44\u00b0 15\u2019 from Arcturus), Mars\u2019s position comes out at 11\u00b0 21\u2019 23\u201c Virgo (from Regulus), 11\u00b0 20\u2019 52\u201c Virgo (from the Neck of Leo), and 11\u00b0 17\u2019 40\u201c (from Spica). Again (as you see) the distances err in being too great. For from the Heart and the Neck [of Leo], Mars is pushed a little eastward, and from Spica and Arcturus a little westward, and more from Arcturus, owing to its greater northern latitude ^33. The mean (ignoring Arcturus), 11\u00b0 19\u2019 20\u201c Virgo, is very nearly true. Also, the latitude is greater, namely, 4\u00b0 7\u2019 40\u201c north. Now from February 15 at 17h to 23 February at 12h, a period of 7 days 19 hours, Mars moved 3\u00b0 0\u2019: 180 minutes in 187 hours. That is, about one minute per hour. And if you wish to take it into account, the parallax (if any) is subtracted from the longitude on February 16 and a little is added on February 23.\n Because the last observation follows the time of observation found by me by 2 days 21 hours 47 min., add the motion corresponding to this time, 1\u00b0 7\u2019: the position will come out 12\u00b0 26\u2019 Virgo. The agreement is thus very good\u2014it could not be better\u2014given that both of us [that is, Kepler and Fabricius] work independently and do not rely on the facilities used by Tycho Brahe.","1732":"VIII. On 1595 October 30 at 8h 20m, the planet was found at 17\u00b0 47\u2019 15\u201c Taurus,19 not far from the nonagesimal. We may thus be sure of the parallax, although we must take it into account. The latitude was 0\u00b0 5\u2019 10\u201c north. The sun\u2019s position was 16\u00b0 50\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio. The distance between the stars was 56\u2019 45\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 35\u201c; that of Mars, 22\u2019 54\u201c, as appears by comparing the nearby observations. The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 23\u2019 29\u201c. If the distance between the stars be divided by this, it comes out to 40\u2019 47\u201c of a day, or 16 hours 19 min. Therefore, the true opposition was 0h 39m PM on October 31. Mars\u2019s position was 17\u00b0 31\u2019 40\u201c Taurus. This needs no reduction to the orbit, as it is nearly at the node. The latitude was about 0\u00b0 8\u2019 north. But comparison with the preceding and following days shows a latitude of about 5\u2019 north.\nIX. Let, at any rate, Mars\u2019s position on 1597 December 10 at 8h 30m be 3\u00b0 45\u00bd\u2019 Cancer (as above) ^20. The sun\u2019s position was 29\u00b0 4\u2019 53\u201c Sagittarius. The distance between the stars was 4\u00b0 40\u2019 37\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 61\u2019 20\u201c, that of Mars 23\u2019 40\u201c (for in 1580 the diurnal motion in Gemini was 23\u2019, and in 1582, at 17\u00b0 Cancer, it was 24\u2019). Therefore, the sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 25\u2019 0\u201c. These data show that the time of true opposition followed 3 days 7 hours 14 min. later, on December 14 at 3h 44m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 2\u00b0 27\u2153\u2019 Cancer. The reduction to the orbit (quite ridiculous here, since the observation itself has an uncertainty of several minutes) requires the addition of about 52\u201c. Therefore, the corrected position was 2\u00b0 28\u2019 Cancer. The latitude, from the table, was 3\u00b0 33\u2019 north.\nOn the same night, the one following December 10, at 12\u2159h, Fabricius in East Frisia found Mars\u2019s position to be 3\u00b0 40\u00bc\u2019 Cancer with latitude 3\u00b0 23\u2019 N. In this observation the longitude comes out nearly the same. For the motion over 3h 40m is 3\u00bd\u2019, so that in the Brahean observation too, at 12\u2159h Mars could have been at 3\u00b0 42\u2019 Cancer\u2014two minutes beyond the Fabrician position.\nX. On 1600 January 13\/23 at 11h 40m, the time being adjusted to Uraniborg time, the planet was observed at 10\u00b0 38\u2019 46\u201c Leo ^21. The sun\u2019s position was 3\u00b0 26\u2019 30\u201c Aquarius. The stars were 7\u00b0 12\u2019 16\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion for the next few days was 1\u00b0 1\u2019 3\u201c; that of Mars, 23\u2019 44\u201c. The sum: 1\u00b0 24\u2019 47\u201c. The opposition therefore followed 5 days 2h 22m after; that is, on January 19\/29 at 2h 2m in the morning, before dawn. Mars was at 8\u00b0 38\u2019 Leo. There is no need for reduction, since it is near the limit. The latitude, from the table, was 4\u00b0 30\u2019 50\u201c N.\nXI. On the evening of 1602 Febr. 18\/28 at 10h 30m, using the Tychonic  instruments (with the help of the learned Matthias Seiffard,22 bequeathed us by Tycho), I took the distance of Mars from the middle star of the tail of Ursa Major 23 to be 52\u00b0 22\u2019. And since the distance between Cor Leonis and Procyon was 37\u00b0 22\u2019 20\u201c, which should have been 37\u00b0 19\u2019 50\u201c,24 we know that the sextant reads 2\u00bd minutes high. Therefore, the corrected distance of Mars from the tail of Ursa was 52\u00b0 19\u00bd\u2019. And since the latitude of the fixed star is 56\u00b0 22\u2019, the remainder, by subtraction, is 4\u00b0 2\u00bd\u2019\u2014supposing that Mars was at precisely the same longitude as the fixed star. But because there was a difference of 3\u00be degrees between them (as is clear from the following observations), a slight correction is required.\n For let AB be 3\u00b0 43\u2019 30\u201c on a parallel close to the ecliptic, B Mars, C the fixed star, and BC 52\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c. Dividing the secant of BC by the secant of AB gives the  secant of CA, 52\u00b0 14\u2019, which, subtracted from 56\u00b0 22\u2019 (the latitude of the fixed star) leaves 4\u00b0 8\u2019 north as Mars\u2019s observed latitude. At the same time, we found 19\u00b0 23\u2019 between Mars and Cor Leonis (19\u00b0 20\u00bd corrected), and 21\u00b0 20\u2019 between Mars and the bright star in the wing of Virgo25 (21\u00b0 17\u00bd\u2019 corrected). From these two distances (using the latitudes of the stars and Mars), Mars\u2019s longitude is found to be 13\u00b0 19\u2019 6\u201c Virgo, by consensus of all measurements.\nAlternatively, the meridian altitude of Mars was found at 12h 40m, using two quadrants, to be 50\u00b0 19\u2019, while the tail of Leo26 was 56\u00b0 45\u2019. Therefore, from the declinations and right ascensions of the fixed stars and our distances, Mars\u2019s position is determined as 13\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c Virgo, latitude 4\u00b0 7\u2019 55\u201c ^27. This is the Tychonic procedure. I have included the other for the sake of showing a consensus, and also that it might be evident that despite the lack of absolute perfection in the demonstration, short cuts either in computation or in our understanding can under certain circumstances be applied. For in that previous procedure there is less in the actual work than in the reporting of it. At Prague, 5\u00b0 Scorpio was rising ^28. Therefore, the nonagesimal was about 32\u00bd\u00b0 from the zenith. And since Mars\u2019s distance from the earth was rather more than half the sun\u2019s distance, the resulting parallax of about 5\u2019 opposite 32\u00bd\u00b0 in our parallactic table, shows a latitudinal parallax of 2\u2019 41\u201c. Thus the latitude as seen from the middle of the earth would be 4\u00b0 10\u2154\u2019 north. And because the altitude of the nonagesimal was 57\u00bd\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax at the horizon was 4\u2019 13\u201c. But since Mars was 38\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, the longitudinal parallax corresponding to this position is 2\u2019 36\u201c, and if this be eliminated, Mars would be placed at about 13\u00b0 18\u2019 Virgo ^29. At that moment, the sun\u2019s position was 10\u00b0 16\u2019 42\u201c Pisces. The distance between the bodies was 3\u00b0 1\u2019 18\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 4\u201c, and that of Mars, 24\u2019 5\u201c (for it was 24\u2019 18\u201c at 21\u00b0 Leo in 1585, and 24\u2019 at 26 Virgo in 1587). The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 24\u2019 9\u201c. The true opposition therefore followed 2 days 3 hours 43 minutes later, on 21 February\/3 March before dawn at 2h 13m, Mars being at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 35\u201c Virgo. Forty seconds must be subtracted to reduce the position to the orbit, putting Mars at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 Virgo, with slightly less latitude than before, since the latitude was then decreasing. It was therefore about 4\u00b0 10\u2019, or 4\u00b0 7\u2153\u2019 if the parallax be neglected.\n But because, since Tycho\u2019s death, we have not made frequent observations nor continued them over several days, it would be best, for certainty\u2019s sake, also to make use of those observations which David Fabricius of East Frisia, a sedulous practitioner of astronomy, has communicated to me.\nOn February 16, old style, at 5h in the morning, he took the planet\u2019s distances from the tail of Leo (for the latitude), from the neck of Leo,30 and, on the other hand, from the bright star in the southern wing of Virgo, so as to check its longitude by working it out twice.\nI could make use of Tycho\u2019s line of reasoning, which he routinely adopted in volume I of the Progymnasmata when (as here) the declination of the planet was not known. But because that method extends to ten operations, I prefer for the sake of brevity to proceed as I did before with my own observations. Here there are no hidden dangers.\nFirst, the star in the wing of Virgo, adjusted to our time, is at 4\u00b0 36\u2019 30\u201c Libra with latitude 2\u00b0 50\u2019 north. Fabricius found that Mars is 20\u00b0 18\u2019 westward from it on the zodiac, which puts Mars at about 14\u00b0 18\u2019 30\u201c Virgo. This is a preliminary, approximate figure: the longitude will shortly be corrected. Now the tail of Leo31 is at 16\u00b0 4\u2019 Virgo, with latitude 12\u00b0 18\u2019 North, and Mars was found to be 8\u00b0 17\u2019 distant from the Tail. What is sought is the distance of its parallel from the Tail, since the difference in longitude is 1\u00b0 45\u2019. Dividing the secant of 8\u00b0 17\u2019 by the secant of 1\u00b0 45\u2019 gives the secant of 8\u00b0 6\u2019, the arc sought. This subtracted from the fixed star\u2019s northern latitude of 12\u00b0 18\u2019 leaves Mars\u2019s latitude, 4\u00b0 12\u2019 north. This I now take as determined, and compare it with the latitudes of the fixed stars according to the laws of trigonometry. From the Wing of Virgo, I find Mars\u2019s longitude to be 14\u00b0 19\u2019 Virgo; from the Neck of Leo, 14\u00b0 23\u2019 36\u201c. The mean of these two is 14\u00b0 21\u2019 18\u201c Virgo. And since the sextant gave distances larger than the truth, the latitude would come out at 4\u00b0 14\u2019 north.\nOn the night following February 23, at 12h, he observed Mars in relation to five fixed stars: the Tail of Leo and Arcturus for latitude, and for the longitude, in the first instance, Spica (which followed it), and, in the second, the Neck of Leo and Cor Leonis (which preceded it).\nBy a rough estimate, I foresee that Mars is going to fall at 11\u00bc\u00b0 Virgo. It was found to be 9\u00b0 24\u2019 from the Tail of Leo, and hence, its latitude comes out at 4\u00b0 6\u2019 ^32. And now, through this and the latitudes of the fixed stars, together with their distances (17\u00b0 26\u2019 from Regulus, 17\u00b0 51\u2019 from the Neck of Leo, 37\u00b0 28\u2019 from Spica, 44\u00b0 15\u2019 from Arcturus), Mars\u2019s position comes out at 11\u00b0 21\u2019 23\u201c Virgo (from Regulus), 11\u00b0 20\u2019 52\u201c Virgo (from the Neck of Leo), and 11\u00b0 17\u2019 40\u201c (from Spica). Again (as you see) the distances err in being too great. For from the Heart and the Neck [of Leo], Mars is pushed a little eastward, and from Spica and Arcturus a little westward, and more from Arcturus, owing to its greater northern latitude ^33. The mean (ignoring Arcturus), 11\u00b0 19\u2019 20\u201c Virgo, is very nearly true. Also, the latitude is greater, namely, 4\u00b0 7\u2019 40\u201c north. Now from February 15 at 17h to 23 February at 12h, a period of 7 days 19 hours, Mars moved 3\u00b0 0\u2019: 180 minutes in 187 hours. That is, about one minute per hour. And if you wish to take it into account, the parallax (if any) is subtracted from the longitude on February 16 and a little is added on February 23.\n Because the last observation follows the time of observation found by me by 2 days 21 hours 47 min., add the motion corresponding to this time, 1\u00b0 7\u2019: the position will come out 12\u00b0 26\u2019 Virgo. The agreement is thus very good\u2014it could not be better\u2014given that both of us [that is, Kepler and Fabricius] work independently and do not rely on the facilities used by Tycho Brahe.","1733":"VIII. On 1595 October 30 at 8h 20m, the planet was found at 17\u00b0 47\u2019 15\u201c Taurus,19 not far from the nonagesimal. We may thus be sure of the parallax, although we must take it into account. The latitude was 0\u00b0 5\u2019 10\u201c north. The sun\u2019s position was 16\u00b0 50\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio. The distance between the stars was 56\u2019 45\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 35\u201c; that of Mars, 22\u2019 54\u201c, as appears by comparing the nearby observations. The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 23\u2019 29\u201c. If the distance between the stars be divided by this, it comes out to 40\u2019 47\u201c of a day, or 16 hours 19 min. Therefore, the true opposition was 0h 39m PM on October 31. Mars\u2019s position was 17\u00b0 31\u2019 40\u201c Taurus. This needs no reduction to the orbit, as it is nearly at the node. The latitude was about 0\u00b0 8\u2019 north. But comparison with the preceding and following days shows a latitude of about 5\u2019 north.\nIX. Let, at any rate, Mars\u2019s position on 1597 December 10 at 8h 30m be 3\u00b0 45\u00bd\u2019 Cancer (as above) ^20. The sun\u2019s position was 29\u00b0 4\u2019 53\u201c Sagittarius. The distance between the stars was 4\u00b0 40\u2019 37\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 61\u2019 20\u201c, that of Mars 23\u2019 40\u201c (for in 1580 the diurnal motion in Gemini was 23\u2019, and in 1582, at 17\u00b0 Cancer, it was 24\u2019). Therefore, the sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 25\u2019 0\u201c. These data show that the time of true opposition followed 3 days 7 hours 14 min. later, on December 14 at 3h 44m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 2\u00b0 27\u2153\u2019 Cancer. The reduction to the orbit (quite ridiculous here, since the observation itself has an uncertainty of several minutes) requires the addition of about 52\u201c. Therefore, the corrected position was 2\u00b0 28\u2019 Cancer. The latitude, from the table, was 3\u00b0 33\u2019 north.\nOn the same night, the one following December 10, at 12\u2159h, Fabricius in East Frisia found Mars\u2019s position to be 3\u00b0 40\u00bc\u2019 Cancer with latitude 3\u00b0 23\u2019 N. In this observation the longitude comes out nearly the same. For the motion over 3h 40m is 3\u00bd\u2019, so that in the Brahean observation too, at 12\u2159h Mars could have been at 3\u00b0 42\u2019 Cancer\u2014two minutes beyond the Fabrician position.\nX. On 1600 January 13\/23 at 11h 40m, the time being adjusted to Uraniborg time, the planet was observed at 10\u00b0 38\u2019 46\u201c Leo ^21. The sun\u2019s position was 3\u00b0 26\u2019 30\u201c Aquarius. The stars were 7\u00b0 12\u2019 16\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion for the next few days was 1\u00b0 1\u2019 3\u201c; that of Mars, 23\u2019 44\u201c. The sum: 1\u00b0 24\u2019 47\u201c. The opposition therefore followed 5 days 2h 22m after; that is, on January 19\/29 at 2h 2m in the morning, before dawn. Mars was at 8\u00b0 38\u2019 Leo. There is no need for reduction, since it is near the limit. The latitude, from the table, was 4\u00b0 30\u2019 50\u201c N.\nXI. On the evening of 1602 Febr. 18\/28 at 10h 30m, using the Tychonic  instruments (with the help of the learned Matthias Seiffard,22 bequeathed us by Tycho), I took the distance of Mars from the middle star of the tail of Ursa Major 23 to be 52\u00b0 22\u2019. And since the distance between Cor Leonis and Procyon was 37\u00b0 22\u2019 20\u201c, which should have been 37\u00b0 19\u2019 50\u201c,24 we know that the sextant reads 2\u00bd minutes high. Therefore, the corrected distance of Mars from the tail of Ursa was 52\u00b0 19\u00bd\u2019. And since the latitude of the fixed star is 56\u00b0 22\u2019, the remainder, by subtraction, is 4\u00b0 2\u00bd\u2019\u2014supposing that Mars was at precisely the same longitude as the fixed star. But because there was a difference of 3\u00be degrees between them (as is clear from the following observations), a slight correction is required.\n For let AB be 3\u00b0 43\u2019 30\u201c on a parallel close to the ecliptic, B Mars, C the fixed star, and BC 52\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c. Dividing the secant of BC by the secant of AB gives the  secant of CA, 52\u00b0 14\u2019, which, subtracted from 56\u00b0 22\u2019 (the latitude of the fixed star) leaves 4\u00b0 8\u2019 north as Mars\u2019s observed latitude. At the same time, we found 19\u00b0 23\u2019 between Mars and Cor Leonis (19\u00b0 20\u00bd corrected), and 21\u00b0 20\u2019 between Mars and the bright star in the wing of Virgo25 (21\u00b0 17\u00bd\u2019 corrected). From these two distances (using the latitudes of the stars and Mars), Mars\u2019s longitude is found to be 13\u00b0 19\u2019 6\u201c Virgo, by consensus of all measurements.\nAlternatively, the meridian altitude of Mars was found at 12h 40m, using two quadrants, to be 50\u00b0 19\u2019, while the tail of Leo26 was 56\u00b0 45\u2019. Therefore, from the declinations and right ascensions of the fixed stars and our distances, Mars\u2019s position is determined as 13\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c Virgo, latitude 4\u00b0 7\u2019 55\u201c ^27. This is the Tychonic procedure. I have included the other for the sake of showing a consensus, and also that it might be evident that despite the lack of absolute perfection in the demonstration, short cuts either in computation or in our understanding can under certain circumstances be applied. For in that previous procedure there is less in the actual work than in the reporting of it. At Prague, 5\u00b0 Scorpio was rising ^28. Therefore, the nonagesimal was about 32\u00bd\u00b0 from the zenith. And since Mars\u2019s distance from the earth was rather more than half the sun\u2019s distance, the resulting parallax of about 5\u2019 opposite 32\u00bd\u00b0 in our parallactic table, shows a latitudinal parallax of 2\u2019 41\u201c. Thus the latitude as seen from the middle of the earth would be 4\u00b0 10\u2154\u2019 north. And because the altitude of the nonagesimal was 57\u00bd\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax at the horizon was 4\u2019 13\u201c. But since Mars was 38\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, the longitudinal parallax corresponding to this position is 2\u2019 36\u201c, and if this be eliminated, Mars would be placed at about 13\u00b0 18\u2019 Virgo ^29. At that moment, the sun\u2019s position was 10\u00b0 16\u2019 42\u201c Pisces. The distance between the bodies was 3\u00b0 1\u2019 18\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 4\u201c, and that of Mars, 24\u2019 5\u201c (for it was 24\u2019 18\u201c at 21\u00b0 Leo in 1585, and 24\u2019 at 26 Virgo in 1587). The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 24\u2019 9\u201c. The true opposition therefore followed 2 days 3 hours 43 minutes later, on 21 February\/3 March before dawn at 2h 13m, Mars being at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 35\u201c Virgo. Forty seconds must be subtracted to reduce the position to the orbit, putting Mars at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 Virgo, with slightly less latitude than before, since the latitude was then decreasing. It was therefore about 4\u00b0 10\u2019, or 4\u00b0 7\u2153\u2019 if the parallax be neglected.\n But because, since Tycho\u2019s death, we have not made frequent observations nor continued them over several days, it would be best, for certainty\u2019s sake, also to make use of those observations which David Fabricius of East Frisia, a sedulous practitioner of astronomy, has communicated to me.\nOn February 16, old style, at 5h in the morning, he took the planet\u2019s distances from the tail of Leo (for the latitude), from the neck of Leo,30 and, on the other hand, from the bright star in the southern wing of Virgo, so as to check its longitude by working it out twice.\nI could make use of Tycho\u2019s line of reasoning, which he routinely adopted in volume I of the Progymnasmata when (as here) the declination of the planet was not known. But because that method extends to ten operations, I prefer for the sake of brevity to proceed as I did before with my own observations. Here there are no hidden dangers.\nFirst, the star in the wing of Virgo, adjusted to our time, is at 4\u00b0 36\u2019 30\u201c Libra with latitude 2\u00b0 50\u2019 north. Fabricius found that Mars is 20\u00b0 18\u2019 westward from it on the zodiac, which puts Mars at about 14\u00b0 18\u2019 30\u201c Virgo. This is a preliminary, approximate figure: the longitude will shortly be corrected. Now the tail of Leo31 is at 16\u00b0 4\u2019 Virgo, with latitude 12\u00b0 18\u2019 North, and Mars was found to be 8\u00b0 17\u2019 distant from the Tail. What is sought is the distance of its parallel from the Tail, since the difference in longitude is 1\u00b0 45\u2019. Dividing the secant of 8\u00b0 17\u2019 by the secant of 1\u00b0 45\u2019 gives the secant of 8\u00b0 6\u2019, the arc sought. This subtracted from the fixed star\u2019s northern latitude of 12\u00b0 18\u2019 leaves Mars\u2019s latitude, 4\u00b0 12\u2019 north. This I now take as determined, and compare it with the latitudes of the fixed stars according to the laws of trigonometry. From the Wing of Virgo, I find Mars\u2019s longitude to be 14\u00b0 19\u2019 Virgo; from the Neck of Leo, 14\u00b0 23\u2019 36\u201c. The mean of these two is 14\u00b0 21\u2019 18\u201c Virgo. And since the sextant gave distances larger than the truth, the latitude would come out at 4\u00b0 14\u2019 north.\nOn the night following February 23, at 12h, he observed Mars in relation to five fixed stars: the Tail of Leo and Arcturus for latitude, and for the longitude, in the first instance, Spica (which followed it), and, in the second, the Neck of Leo and Cor Leonis (which preceded it).\nBy a rough estimate, I foresee that Mars is going to fall at 11\u00bc\u00b0 Virgo. It was found to be 9\u00b0 24\u2019 from the Tail of Leo, and hence, its latitude comes out at 4\u00b0 6\u2019 ^32. And now, through this and the latitudes of the fixed stars, together with their distances (17\u00b0 26\u2019 from Regulus, 17\u00b0 51\u2019 from the Neck of Leo, 37\u00b0 28\u2019 from Spica, 44\u00b0 15\u2019 from Arcturus), Mars\u2019s position comes out at 11\u00b0 21\u2019 23\u201c Virgo (from Regulus), 11\u00b0 20\u2019 52\u201c Virgo (from the Neck of Leo), and 11\u00b0 17\u2019 40\u201c (from Spica). Again (as you see) the distances err in being too great. For from the Heart and the Neck [of Leo], Mars is pushed a little eastward, and from Spica and Arcturus a little westward, and more from Arcturus, owing to its greater northern latitude ^33. The mean (ignoring Arcturus), 11\u00b0 19\u2019 20\u201c Virgo, is very nearly true. Also, the latitude is greater, namely, 4\u00b0 7\u2019 40\u201c north. Now from February 15 at 17h to 23 February at 12h, a period of 7 days 19 hours, Mars moved 3\u00b0 0\u2019: 180 minutes in 187 hours. That is, about one minute per hour. And if you wish to take it into account, the parallax (if any) is subtracted from the longitude on February 16 and a little is added on February 23.\n Because the last observation follows the time of observation found by me by 2 days 21 hours 47 min., add the motion corresponding to this time, 1\u00b0 7\u2019: the position will come out 12\u00b0 26\u2019 Virgo. The agreement is thus very good\u2014it could not be better\u2014given that both of us [that is, Kepler and Fabricius] work independently and do not rely on the facilities used by Tycho Brahe.","1734":"VIII. On 1595 October 30 at 8h 20m, the planet was found at 17\u00b0 47\u2019 15\u201c Taurus,19 not far from the nonagesimal. We may thus be sure of the parallax, although we must take it into account. The latitude was 0\u00b0 5\u2019 10\u201c north. The sun\u2019s position was 16\u00b0 50\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio. The distance between the stars was 56\u2019 45\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 35\u201c; that of Mars, 22\u2019 54\u201c, as appears by comparing the nearby observations. The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 23\u2019 29\u201c. If the distance between the stars be divided by this, it comes out to 40\u2019 47\u201c of a day, or 16 hours 19 min. Therefore, the true opposition was 0h 39m PM on October 31. Mars\u2019s position was 17\u00b0 31\u2019 40\u201c Taurus. This needs no reduction to the orbit, as it is nearly at the node. The latitude was about 0\u00b0 8\u2019 north. But comparison with the preceding and following days shows a latitude of about 5\u2019 north.\nIX. Let, at any rate, Mars\u2019s position on 1597 December 10 at 8h 30m be 3\u00b0 45\u00bd\u2019 Cancer (as above) ^20. The sun\u2019s position was 29\u00b0 4\u2019 53\u201c Sagittarius. The distance between the stars was 4\u00b0 40\u2019 37\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 61\u2019 20\u201c, that of Mars 23\u2019 40\u201c (for in 1580 the diurnal motion in Gemini was 23\u2019, and in 1582, at 17\u00b0 Cancer, it was 24\u2019). Therefore, the sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 25\u2019 0\u201c. These data show that the time of true opposition followed 3 days 7 hours 14 min. later, on December 14 at 3h 44m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 2\u00b0 27\u2153\u2019 Cancer. The reduction to the orbit (quite ridiculous here, since the observation itself has an uncertainty of several minutes) requires the addition of about 52\u201c. Therefore, the corrected position was 2\u00b0 28\u2019 Cancer. The latitude, from the table, was 3\u00b0 33\u2019 north.\nOn the same night, the one following December 10, at 12\u2159h, Fabricius in East Frisia found Mars\u2019s position to be 3\u00b0 40\u00bc\u2019 Cancer with latitude 3\u00b0 23\u2019 N. In this observation the longitude comes out nearly the same. For the motion over 3h 40m is 3\u00bd\u2019, so that in the Brahean observation too, at 12\u2159h Mars could have been at 3\u00b0 42\u2019 Cancer\u2014two minutes beyond the Fabrician position.\nX. On 1600 January 13\/23 at 11h 40m, the time being adjusted to Uraniborg time, the planet was observed at 10\u00b0 38\u2019 46\u201c Leo ^21. The sun\u2019s position was 3\u00b0 26\u2019 30\u201c Aquarius. The stars were 7\u00b0 12\u2019 16\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion for the next few days was 1\u00b0 1\u2019 3\u201c; that of Mars, 23\u2019 44\u201c. The sum: 1\u00b0 24\u2019 47\u201c. The opposition therefore followed 5 days 2h 22m after; that is, on January 19\/29 at 2h 2m in the morning, before dawn. Mars was at 8\u00b0 38\u2019 Leo. There is no need for reduction, since it is near the limit. The latitude, from the table, was 4\u00b0 30\u2019 50\u201c N.\nXI. On the evening of 1602 Febr. 18\/28 at 10h 30m, using the Tychonic  instruments (with the help of the learned Matthias Seiffard,22 bequeathed us by Tycho), I took the distance of Mars from the middle star of the tail of Ursa Major 23 to be 52\u00b0 22\u2019. And since the distance between Cor Leonis and Procyon was 37\u00b0 22\u2019 20\u201c, which should have been 37\u00b0 19\u2019 50\u201c,24 we know that the sextant reads 2\u00bd minutes high. Therefore, the corrected distance of Mars from the tail of Ursa was 52\u00b0 19\u00bd\u2019. And since the latitude of the fixed star is 56\u00b0 22\u2019, the remainder, by subtraction, is 4\u00b0 2\u00bd\u2019\u2014supposing that Mars was at precisely the same longitude as the fixed star. But because there was a difference of 3\u00be degrees between them (as is clear from the following observations), a slight correction is required.\n For let AB be 3\u00b0 43\u2019 30\u201c on a parallel close to the ecliptic, B Mars, C the fixed star, and BC 52\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c. Dividing the secant of BC by the secant of AB gives the  secant of CA, 52\u00b0 14\u2019, which, subtracted from 56\u00b0 22\u2019 (the latitude of the fixed star) leaves 4\u00b0 8\u2019 north as Mars\u2019s observed latitude. At the same time, we found 19\u00b0 23\u2019 between Mars and Cor Leonis (19\u00b0 20\u00bd corrected), and 21\u00b0 20\u2019 between Mars and the bright star in the wing of Virgo25 (21\u00b0 17\u00bd\u2019 corrected). From these two distances (using the latitudes of the stars and Mars), Mars\u2019s longitude is found to be 13\u00b0 19\u2019 6\u201c Virgo, by consensus of all measurements.\nAlternatively, the meridian altitude of Mars was found at 12h 40m, using two quadrants, to be 50\u00b0 19\u2019, while the tail of Leo26 was 56\u00b0 45\u2019. Therefore, from the declinations and right ascensions of the fixed stars and our distances, Mars\u2019s position is determined as 13\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c Virgo, latitude 4\u00b0 7\u2019 55\u201c ^27. This is the Tychonic procedure. I have included the other for the sake of showing a consensus, and also that it might be evident that despite the lack of absolute perfection in the demonstration, short cuts either in computation or in our understanding can under certain circumstances be applied. For in that previous procedure there is less in the actual work than in the reporting of it. At Prague, 5\u00b0 Scorpio was rising ^28. Therefore, the nonagesimal was about 32\u00bd\u00b0 from the zenith. And since Mars\u2019s distance from the earth was rather more than half the sun\u2019s distance, the resulting parallax of about 5\u2019 opposite 32\u00bd\u00b0 in our parallactic table, shows a latitudinal parallax of 2\u2019 41\u201c. Thus the latitude as seen from the middle of the earth would be 4\u00b0 10\u2154\u2019 north. And because the altitude of the nonagesimal was 57\u00bd\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax at the horizon was 4\u2019 13\u201c. But since Mars was 38\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, the longitudinal parallax corresponding to this position is 2\u2019 36\u201c, and if this be eliminated, Mars would be placed at about 13\u00b0 18\u2019 Virgo ^29. At that moment, the sun\u2019s position was 10\u00b0 16\u2019 42\u201c Pisces. The distance between the bodies was 3\u00b0 1\u2019 18\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 4\u201c, and that of Mars, 24\u2019 5\u201c (for it was 24\u2019 18\u201c at 21\u00b0 Leo in 1585, and 24\u2019 at 26 Virgo in 1587). The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 24\u2019 9\u201c. The true opposition therefore followed 2 days 3 hours 43 minutes later, on 21 February\/3 March before dawn at 2h 13m, Mars being at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 35\u201c Virgo. Forty seconds must be subtracted to reduce the position to the orbit, putting Mars at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 Virgo, with slightly less latitude than before, since the latitude was then decreasing. It was therefore about 4\u00b0 10\u2019, or 4\u00b0 7\u2153\u2019 if the parallax be neglected.\n But because, since Tycho\u2019s death, we have not made frequent observations nor continued them over several days, it would be best, for certainty\u2019s sake, also to make use of those observations which David Fabricius of East Frisia, a sedulous practitioner of astronomy, has communicated to me.\nOn February 16, old style, at 5h in the morning, he took the planet\u2019s distances from the tail of Leo (for the latitude), from the neck of Leo,30 and, on the other hand, from the bright star in the southern wing of Virgo, so as to check its longitude by working it out twice.\nI could make use of Tycho\u2019s line of reasoning, which he routinely adopted in volume I of the Progymnasmata when (as here) the declination of the planet was not known. But because that method extends to ten operations, I prefer for the sake of brevity to proceed as I did before with my own observations. Here there are no hidden dangers.\nFirst, the star in the wing of Virgo, adjusted to our time, is at 4\u00b0 36\u2019 30\u201c Libra with latitude 2\u00b0 50\u2019 north. Fabricius found that Mars is 20\u00b0 18\u2019 westward from it on the zodiac, which puts Mars at about 14\u00b0 18\u2019 30\u201c Virgo. This is a preliminary, approximate figure: the longitude will shortly be corrected. Now the tail of Leo31 is at 16\u00b0 4\u2019 Virgo, with latitude 12\u00b0 18\u2019 North, and Mars was found to be 8\u00b0 17\u2019 distant from the Tail. What is sought is the distance of its parallel from the Tail, since the difference in longitude is 1\u00b0 45\u2019. Dividing the secant of 8\u00b0 17\u2019 by the secant of 1\u00b0 45\u2019 gives the secant of 8\u00b0 6\u2019, the arc sought. This subtracted from the fixed star\u2019s northern latitude of 12\u00b0 18\u2019 leaves Mars\u2019s latitude, 4\u00b0 12\u2019 north. This I now take as determined, and compare it with the latitudes of the fixed stars according to the laws of trigonometry. From the Wing of Virgo, I find Mars\u2019s longitude to be 14\u00b0 19\u2019 Virgo; from the Neck of Leo, 14\u00b0 23\u2019 36\u201c. The mean of these two is 14\u00b0 21\u2019 18\u201c Virgo. And since the sextant gave distances larger than the truth, the latitude would come out at 4\u00b0 14\u2019 north.\nOn the night following February 23, at 12h, he observed Mars in relation to five fixed stars: the Tail of Leo and Arcturus for latitude, and for the longitude, in the first instance, Spica (which followed it), and, in the second, the Neck of Leo and Cor Leonis (which preceded it).\nBy a rough estimate, I foresee that Mars is going to fall at 11\u00bc\u00b0 Virgo. It was found to be 9\u00b0 24\u2019 from the Tail of Leo, and hence, its latitude comes out at 4\u00b0 6\u2019 ^32. And now, through this and the latitudes of the fixed stars, together with their distances (17\u00b0 26\u2019 from Regulus, 17\u00b0 51\u2019 from the Neck of Leo, 37\u00b0 28\u2019 from Spica, 44\u00b0 15\u2019 from Arcturus), Mars\u2019s position comes out at 11\u00b0 21\u2019 23\u201c Virgo (from Regulus), 11\u00b0 20\u2019 52\u201c Virgo (from the Neck of Leo), and 11\u00b0 17\u2019 40\u201c (from Spica). Again (as you see) the distances err in being too great. For from the Heart and the Neck [of Leo], Mars is pushed a little eastward, and from Spica and Arcturus a little westward, and more from Arcturus, owing to its greater northern latitude ^33. The mean (ignoring Arcturus), 11\u00b0 19\u2019 20\u201c Virgo, is very nearly true. Also, the latitude is greater, namely, 4\u00b0 7\u2019 40\u201c north. Now from February 15 at 17h to 23 February at 12h, a period of 7 days 19 hours, Mars moved 3\u00b0 0\u2019: 180 minutes in 187 hours. That is, about one minute per hour. And if you wish to take it into account, the parallax (if any) is subtracted from the longitude on February 16 and a little is added on February 23.\n Because the last observation follows the time of observation found by me by 2 days 21 hours 47 min., add the motion corresponding to this time, 1\u00b0 7\u2019: the position will come out 12\u00b0 26\u2019 Virgo. The agreement is thus very good\u2014it could not be better\u2014given that both of us [that is, Kepler and Fabricius] work independently and do not rely on the facilities used by Tycho Brahe.","1735":"VIII. On 1595 October 30 at 8h 20m, the planet was found at 17\u00b0 47\u2019 15\u201c Taurus,19 not far from the nonagesimal. We may thus be sure of the parallax, although we must take it into account. The latitude was 0\u00b0 5\u2019 10\u201c north. The sun\u2019s position was 16\u00b0 50\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio. The distance between the stars was 56\u2019 45\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 35\u201c; that of Mars, 22\u2019 54\u201c, as appears by comparing the nearby observations. The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 23\u2019 29\u201c. If the distance between the stars be divided by this, it comes out to 40\u2019 47\u201c of a day, or 16 hours 19 min. Therefore, the true opposition was 0h 39m PM on October 31. Mars\u2019s position was 17\u00b0 31\u2019 40\u201c Taurus. This needs no reduction to the orbit, as it is nearly at the node. The latitude was about 0\u00b0 8\u2019 north. But comparison with the preceding and following days shows a latitude of about 5\u2019 north.\nIX. Let, at any rate, Mars\u2019s position on 1597 December 10 at 8h 30m be 3\u00b0 45\u00bd\u2019 Cancer (as above) ^20. The sun\u2019s position was 29\u00b0 4\u2019 53\u201c Sagittarius. The distance between the stars was 4\u00b0 40\u2019 37\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 61\u2019 20\u201c, that of Mars 23\u2019 40\u201c (for in 1580 the diurnal motion in Gemini was 23\u2019, and in 1582, at 17\u00b0 Cancer, it was 24\u2019). Therefore, the sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 25\u2019 0\u201c. These data show that the time of true opposition followed 3 days 7 hours 14 min. later, on December 14 at 3h 44m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 2\u00b0 27\u2153\u2019 Cancer. The reduction to the orbit (quite ridiculous here, since the observation itself has an uncertainty of several minutes) requires the addition of about 52\u201c. Therefore, the corrected position was 2\u00b0 28\u2019 Cancer. The latitude, from the table, was 3\u00b0 33\u2019 north.\nOn the same night, the one following December 10, at 12\u2159h, Fabricius in East Frisia found Mars\u2019s position to be 3\u00b0 40\u00bc\u2019 Cancer with latitude 3\u00b0 23\u2019 N. In this observation the longitude comes out nearly the same. For the motion over 3h 40m is 3\u00bd\u2019, so that in the Brahean observation too, at 12\u2159h Mars could have been at 3\u00b0 42\u2019 Cancer\u2014two minutes beyond the Fabrician position.\nX. On 1600 January 13\/23 at 11h 40m, the time being adjusted to Uraniborg time, the planet was observed at 10\u00b0 38\u2019 46\u201c Leo ^21. The sun\u2019s position was 3\u00b0 26\u2019 30\u201c Aquarius. The stars were 7\u00b0 12\u2019 16\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion for the next few days was 1\u00b0 1\u2019 3\u201c; that of Mars, 23\u2019 44\u201c. The sum: 1\u00b0 24\u2019 47\u201c. The opposition therefore followed 5 days 2h 22m after; that is, on January 19\/29 at 2h 2m in the morning, before dawn. Mars was at 8\u00b0 38\u2019 Leo. There is no need for reduction, since it is near the limit. The latitude, from the table, was 4\u00b0 30\u2019 50\u201c N.\nXI. On the evening of 1602 Febr. 18\/28 at 10h 30m, using the Tychonic  instruments (with the help of the learned Matthias Seiffard,22 bequeathed us by Tycho), I took the distance of Mars from the middle star of the tail of Ursa Major 23 to be 52\u00b0 22\u2019. And since the distance between Cor Leonis and Procyon was 37\u00b0 22\u2019 20\u201c, which should have been 37\u00b0 19\u2019 50\u201c,24 we know that the sextant reads 2\u00bd minutes high. Therefore, the corrected distance of Mars from the tail of Ursa was 52\u00b0 19\u00bd\u2019. And since the latitude of the fixed star is 56\u00b0 22\u2019, the remainder, by subtraction, is 4\u00b0 2\u00bd\u2019\u2014supposing that Mars was at precisely the same longitude as the fixed star. But because there was a difference of 3\u00be degrees between them (as is clear from the following observations), a slight correction is required.\n For let AB be 3\u00b0 43\u2019 30\u201c on a parallel close to the ecliptic, B Mars, C the fixed star, and BC 52\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c. Dividing the secant of BC by the secant of AB gives the  secant of CA, 52\u00b0 14\u2019, which, subtracted from 56\u00b0 22\u2019 (the latitude of the fixed star) leaves 4\u00b0 8\u2019 north as Mars\u2019s observed latitude. At the same time, we found 19\u00b0 23\u2019 between Mars and Cor Leonis (19\u00b0 20\u00bd corrected), and 21\u00b0 20\u2019 between Mars and the bright star in the wing of Virgo25 (21\u00b0 17\u00bd\u2019 corrected). From these two distances (using the latitudes of the stars and Mars), Mars\u2019s longitude is found to be 13\u00b0 19\u2019 6\u201c Virgo, by consensus of all measurements.\nAlternatively, the meridian altitude of Mars was found at 12h 40m, using two quadrants, to be 50\u00b0 19\u2019, while the tail of Leo26 was 56\u00b0 45\u2019. Therefore, from the declinations and right ascensions of the fixed stars and our distances, Mars\u2019s position is determined as 13\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c Virgo, latitude 4\u00b0 7\u2019 55\u201c ^27. This is the Tychonic procedure. I have included the other for the sake of showing a consensus, and also that it might be evident that despite the lack of absolute perfection in the demonstration, short cuts either in computation or in our understanding can under certain circumstances be applied. For in that previous procedure there is less in the actual work than in the reporting of it. At Prague, 5\u00b0 Scorpio was rising ^28. Therefore, the nonagesimal was about 32\u00bd\u00b0 from the zenith. And since Mars\u2019s distance from the earth was rather more than half the sun\u2019s distance, the resulting parallax of about 5\u2019 opposite 32\u00bd\u00b0 in our parallactic table, shows a latitudinal parallax of 2\u2019 41\u201c. Thus the latitude as seen from the middle of the earth would be 4\u00b0 10\u2154\u2019 north. And because the altitude of the nonagesimal was 57\u00bd\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax at the horizon was 4\u2019 13\u201c. But since Mars was 38\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, the longitudinal parallax corresponding to this position is 2\u2019 36\u201c, and if this be eliminated, Mars would be placed at about 13\u00b0 18\u2019 Virgo ^29. At that moment, the sun\u2019s position was 10\u00b0 16\u2019 42\u201c Pisces. The distance between the bodies was 3\u00b0 1\u2019 18\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 4\u201c, and that of Mars, 24\u2019 5\u201c (for it was 24\u2019 18\u201c at 21\u00b0 Leo in 1585, and 24\u2019 at 26 Virgo in 1587). The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 24\u2019 9\u201c. The true opposition therefore followed 2 days 3 hours 43 minutes later, on 21 February\/3 March before dawn at 2h 13m, Mars being at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 35\u201c Virgo. Forty seconds must be subtracted to reduce the position to the orbit, putting Mars at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 Virgo, with slightly less latitude than before, since the latitude was then decreasing. It was therefore about 4\u00b0 10\u2019, or 4\u00b0 7\u2153\u2019 if the parallax be neglected.\n But because, since Tycho\u2019s death, we have not made frequent observations nor continued them over several days, it would be best, for certainty\u2019s sake, also to make use of those observations which David Fabricius of East Frisia, a sedulous practitioner of astronomy, has communicated to me.\nOn February 16, old style, at 5h in the morning, he took the planet\u2019s distances from the tail of Leo (for the latitude), from the neck of Leo,30 and, on the other hand, from the bright star in the southern wing of Virgo, so as to check its longitude by working it out twice.\nI could make use of Tycho\u2019s line of reasoning, which he routinely adopted in volume I of the Progymnasmata when (as here) the declination of the planet was not known. But because that method extends to ten operations, I prefer for the sake of brevity to proceed as I did before with my own observations. Here there are no hidden dangers.\nFirst, the star in the wing of Virgo, adjusted to our time, is at 4\u00b0 36\u2019 30\u201c Libra with latitude 2\u00b0 50\u2019 north. Fabricius found that Mars is 20\u00b0 18\u2019 westward from it on the zodiac, which puts Mars at about 14\u00b0 18\u2019 30\u201c Virgo. This is a preliminary, approximate figure: the longitude will shortly be corrected. Now the tail of Leo31 is at 16\u00b0 4\u2019 Virgo, with latitude 12\u00b0 18\u2019 North, and Mars was found to be 8\u00b0 17\u2019 distant from the Tail. What is sought is the distance of its parallel from the Tail, since the difference in longitude is 1\u00b0 45\u2019. Dividing the secant of 8\u00b0 17\u2019 by the secant of 1\u00b0 45\u2019 gives the secant of 8\u00b0 6\u2019, the arc sought. This subtracted from the fixed star\u2019s northern latitude of 12\u00b0 18\u2019 leaves Mars\u2019s latitude, 4\u00b0 12\u2019 north. This I now take as determined, and compare it with the latitudes of the fixed stars according to the laws of trigonometry. From the Wing of Virgo, I find Mars\u2019s longitude to be 14\u00b0 19\u2019 Virgo; from the Neck of Leo, 14\u00b0 23\u2019 36\u201c. The mean of these two is 14\u00b0 21\u2019 18\u201c Virgo. And since the sextant gave distances larger than the truth, the latitude would come out at 4\u00b0 14\u2019 north.\nOn the night following February 23, at 12h, he observed Mars in relation to five fixed stars: the Tail of Leo and Arcturus for latitude, and for the longitude, in the first instance, Spica (which followed it), and, in the second, the Neck of Leo and Cor Leonis (which preceded it).\nBy a rough estimate, I foresee that Mars is going to fall at 11\u00bc\u00b0 Virgo. It was found to be 9\u00b0 24\u2019 from the Tail of Leo, and hence, its latitude comes out at 4\u00b0 6\u2019 ^32. And now, through this and the latitudes of the fixed stars, together with their distances (17\u00b0 26\u2019 from Regulus, 17\u00b0 51\u2019 from the Neck of Leo, 37\u00b0 28\u2019 from Spica, 44\u00b0 15\u2019 from Arcturus), Mars\u2019s position comes out at 11\u00b0 21\u2019 23\u201c Virgo (from Regulus), 11\u00b0 20\u2019 52\u201c Virgo (from the Neck of Leo), and 11\u00b0 17\u2019 40\u201c (from Spica). Again (as you see) the distances err in being too great. For from the Heart and the Neck [of Leo], Mars is pushed a little eastward, and from Spica and Arcturus a little westward, and more from Arcturus, owing to its greater northern latitude ^33. The mean (ignoring Arcturus), 11\u00b0 19\u2019 20\u201c Virgo, is very nearly true. Also, the latitude is greater, namely, 4\u00b0 7\u2019 40\u201c north. Now from February 15 at 17h to 23 February at 12h, a period of 7 days 19 hours, Mars moved 3\u00b0 0\u2019: 180 minutes in 187 hours. That is, about one minute per hour. And if you wish to take it into account, the parallax (if any) is subtracted from the longitude on February 16 and a little is added on February 23.\n Because the last observation follows the time of observation found by me by 2 days 21 hours 47 min., add the motion corresponding to this time, 1\u00b0 7\u2019: the position will come out 12\u00b0 26\u2019 Virgo. The agreement is thus very good\u2014it could not be better\u2014given that both of us [that is, Kepler and Fabricius] work independently and do not rely on the facilities used by Tycho Brahe.","1736":"VIII. On 1595 October 30 at 8h 20m, the planet was found at 17\u00b0 47\u2019 15\u201c Taurus,19 not far from the nonagesimal. We may thus be sure of the parallax, although we must take it into account. The latitude was 0\u00b0 5\u2019 10\u201c north. The sun\u2019s position was 16\u00b0 50\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio. The distance between the stars was 56\u2019 45\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 35\u201c; that of Mars, 22\u2019 54\u201c, as appears by comparing the nearby observations. The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 23\u2019 29\u201c. If the distance between the stars be divided by this, it comes out to 40\u2019 47\u201c of a day, or 16 hours 19 min. Therefore, the true opposition was 0h 39m PM on October 31. Mars\u2019s position was 17\u00b0 31\u2019 40\u201c Taurus. This needs no reduction to the orbit, as it is nearly at the node. The latitude was about 0\u00b0 8\u2019 north. But comparison with the preceding and following days shows a latitude of about 5\u2019 north.\nIX. Let, at any rate, Mars\u2019s position on 1597 December 10 at 8h 30m be 3\u00b0 45\u00bd\u2019 Cancer (as above) ^20. The sun\u2019s position was 29\u00b0 4\u2019 53\u201c Sagittarius. The distance between the stars was 4\u00b0 40\u2019 37\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 61\u2019 20\u201c, that of Mars 23\u2019 40\u201c (for in 1580 the diurnal motion in Gemini was 23\u2019, and in 1582, at 17\u00b0 Cancer, it was 24\u2019). Therefore, the sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 25\u2019 0\u201c. These data show that the time of true opposition followed 3 days 7 hours 14 min. later, on December 14 at 3h 44m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 2\u00b0 27\u2153\u2019 Cancer. The reduction to the orbit (quite ridiculous here, since the observation itself has an uncertainty of several minutes) requires the addition of about 52\u201c. Therefore, the corrected position was 2\u00b0 28\u2019 Cancer. The latitude, from the table, was 3\u00b0 33\u2019 north.\nOn the same night, the one following December 10, at 12\u2159h, Fabricius in East Frisia found Mars\u2019s position to be 3\u00b0 40\u00bc\u2019 Cancer with latitude 3\u00b0 23\u2019 N. In this observation the longitude comes out nearly the same. For the motion over 3h 40m is 3\u00bd\u2019, so that in the Brahean observation too, at 12\u2159h Mars could have been at 3\u00b0 42\u2019 Cancer\u2014two minutes beyond the Fabrician position.\nX. On 1600 January 13\/23 at 11h 40m, the time being adjusted to Uraniborg time, the planet was observed at 10\u00b0 38\u2019 46\u201c Leo ^21. The sun\u2019s position was 3\u00b0 26\u2019 30\u201c Aquarius. The stars were 7\u00b0 12\u2019 16\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion for the next few days was 1\u00b0 1\u2019 3\u201c; that of Mars, 23\u2019 44\u201c. The sum: 1\u00b0 24\u2019 47\u201c. The opposition therefore followed 5 days 2h 22m after; that is, on January 19\/29 at 2h 2m in the morning, before dawn. Mars was at 8\u00b0 38\u2019 Leo. There is no need for reduction, since it is near the limit. The latitude, from the table, was 4\u00b0 30\u2019 50\u201c N.\nXI. On the evening of 1602 Febr. 18\/28 at 10h 30m, using the Tychonic  instruments (with the help of the learned Matthias Seiffard,22 bequeathed us by Tycho), I took the distance of Mars from the middle star of the tail of Ursa Major 23 to be 52\u00b0 22\u2019. And since the distance between Cor Leonis and Procyon was 37\u00b0 22\u2019 20\u201c, which should have been 37\u00b0 19\u2019 50\u201c,24 we know that the sextant reads 2\u00bd minutes high. Therefore, the corrected distance of Mars from the tail of Ursa was 52\u00b0 19\u00bd\u2019. And since the latitude of the fixed star is 56\u00b0 22\u2019, the remainder, by subtraction, is 4\u00b0 2\u00bd\u2019\u2014supposing that Mars was at precisely the same longitude as the fixed star. But because there was a difference of 3\u00be degrees between them (as is clear from the following observations), a slight correction is required.\n For let AB be 3\u00b0 43\u2019 30\u201c on a parallel close to the ecliptic, B Mars, C the fixed star, and BC 52\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c. Dividing the secant of BC by the secant of AB gives the  secant of CA, 52\u00b0 14\u2019, which, subtracted from 56\u00b0 22\u2019 (the latitude of the fixed star) leaves 4\u00b0 8\u2019 north as Mars\u2019s observed latitude. At the same time, we found 19\u00b0 23\u2019 between Mars and Cor Leonis (19\u00b0 20\u00bd corrected), and 21\u00b0 20\u2019 between Mars and the bright star in the wing of Virgo25 (21\u00b0 17\u00bd\u2019 corrected). From these two distances (using the latitudes of the stars and Mars), Mars\u2019s longitude is found to be 13\u00b0 19\u2019 6\u201c Virgo, by consensus of all measurements.\nAlternatively, the meridian altitude of Mars was found at 12h 40m, using two quadrants, to be 50\u00b0 19\u2019, while the tail of Leo26 was 56\u00b0 45\u2019. Therefore, from the declinations and right ascensions of the fixed stars and our distances, Mars\u2019s position is determined as 13\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c Virgo, latitude 4\u00b0 7\u2019 55\u201c ^27. This is the Tychonic procedure. I have included the other for the sake of showing a consensus, and also that it might be evident that despite the lack of absolute perfection in the demonstration, short cuts either in computation or in our understanding can under certain circumstances be applied. For in that previous procedure there is less in the actual work than in the reporting of it. At Prague, 5\u00b0 Scorpio was rising ^28. Therefore, the nonagesimal was about 32\u00bd\u00b0 from the zenith. And since Mars\u2019s distance from the earth was rather more than half the sun\u2019s distance, the resulting parallax of about 5\u2019 opposite 32\u00bd\u00b0 in our parallactic table, shows a latitudinal parallax of 2\u2019 41\u201c. Thus the latitude as seen from the middle of the earth would be 4\u00b0 10\u2154\u2019 north. And because the altitude of the nonagesimal was 57\u00bd\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax at the horizon was 4\u2019 13\u201c. But since Mars was 38\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, the longitudinal parallax corresponding to this position is 2\u2019 36\u201c, and if this be eliminated, Mars would be placed at about 13\u00b0 18\u2019 Virgo ^29. At that moment, the sun\u2019s position was 10\u00b0 16\u2019 42\u201c Pisces. The distance between the bodies was 3\u00b0 1\u2019 18\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 4\u201c, and that of Mars, 24\u2019 5\u201c (for it was 24\u2019 18\u201c at 21\u00b0 Leo in 1585, and 24\u2019 at 26 Virgo in 1587). The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 24\u2019 9\u201c. The true opposition therefore followed 2 days 3 hours 43 minutes later, on 21 February\/3 March before dawn at 2h 13m, Mars being at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 35\u201c Virgo. Forty seconds must be subtracted to reduce the position to the orbit, putting Mars at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 Virgo, with slightly less latitude than before, since the latitude was then decreasing. It was therefore about 4\u00b0 10\u2019, or 4\u00b0 7\u2153\u2019 if the parallax be neglected.\n But because, since Tycho\u2019s death, we have not made frequent observations nor continued them over several days, it would be best, for certainty\u2019s sake, also to make use of those observations which David Fabricius of East Frisia, a sedulous practitioner of astronomy, has communicated to me.\nOn February 16, old style, at 5h in the morning, he took the planet\u2019s distances from the tail of Leo (for the latitude), from the neck of Leo,30 and, on the other hand, from the bright star in the southern wing of Virgo, so as to check its longitude by working it out twice.\nI could make use of Tycho\u2019s line of reasoning, which he routinely adopted in volume I of the Progymnasmata when (as here) the declination of the planet was not known. But because that method extends to ten operations, I prefer for the sake of brevity to proceed as I did before with my own observations. Here there are no hidden dangers.\nFirst, the star in the wing of Virgo, adjusted to our time, is at 4\u00b0 36\u2019 30\u201c Libra with latitude 2\u00b0 50\u2019 north. Fabricius found that Mars is 20\u00b0 18\u2019 westward from it on the zodiac, which puts Mars at about 14\u00b0 18\u2019 30\u201c Virgo. This is a preliminary, approximate figure: the longitude will shortly be corrected. Now the tail of Leo31 is at 16\u00b0 4\u2019 Virgo, with latitude 12\u00b0 18\u2019 North, and Mars was found to be 8\u00b0 17\u2019 distant from the Tail. What is sought is the distance of its parallel from the Tail, since the difference in longitude is 1\u00b0 45\u2019. Dividing the secant of 8\u00b0 17\u2019 by the secant of 1\u00b0 45\u2019 gives the secant of 8\u00b0 6\u2019, the arc sought. This subtracted from the fixed star\u2019s northern latitude of 12\u00b0 18\u2019 leaves Mars\u2019s latitude, 4\u00b0 12\u2019 north. This I now take as determined, and compare it with the latitudes of the fixed stars according to the laws of trigonometry. From the Wing of Virgo, I find Mars\u2019s longitude to be 14\u00b0 19\u2019 Virgo; from the Neck of Leo, 14\u00b0 23\u2019 36\u201c. The mean of these two is 14\u00b0 21\u2019 18\u201c Virgo. And since the sextant gave distances larger than the truth, the latitude would come out at 4\u00b0 14\u2019 north.\nOn the night following February 23, at 12h, he observed Mars in relation to five fixed stars: the Tail of Leo and Arcturus for latitude, and for the longitude, in the first instance, Spica (which followed it), and, in the second, the Neck of Leo and Cor Leonis (which preceded it).\nBy a rough estimate, I foresee that Mars is going to fall at 11\u00bc\u00b0 Virgo. It was found to be 9\u00b0 24\u2019 from the Tail of Leo, and hence, its latitude comes out at 4\u00b0 6\u2019 ^32. And now, through this and the latitudes of the fixed stars, together with their distances (17\u00b0 26\u2019 from Regulus, 17\u00b0 51\u2019 from the Neck of Leo, 37\u00b0 28\u2019 from Spica, 44\u00b0 15\u2019 from Arcturus), Mars\u2019s position comes out at 11\u00b0 21\u2019 23\u201c Virgo (from Regulus), 11\u00b0 20\u2019 52\u201c Virgo (from the Neck of Leo), and 11\u00b0 17\u2019 40\u201c (from Spica). Again (as you see) the distances err in being too great. For from the Heart and the Neck [of Leo], Mars is pushed a little eastward, and from Spica and Arcturus a little westward, and more from Arcturus, owing to its greater northern latitude ^33. The mean (ignoring Arcturus), 11\u00b0 19\u2019 20\u201c Virgo, is very nearly true. Also, the latitude is greater, namely, 4\u00b0 7\u2019 40\u201c north. Now from February 15 at 17h to 23 February at 12h, a period of 7 days 19 hours, Mars moved 3\u00b0 0\u2019: 180 minutes in 187 hours. That is, about one minute per hour. And if you wish to take it into account, the parallax (if any) is subtracted from the longitude on February 16 and a little is added on February 23.\n Because the last observation follows the time of observation found by me by 2 days 21 hours 47 min., add the motion corresponding to this time, 1\u00b0 7\u2019: the position will come out 12\u00b0 26\u2019 Virgo. The agreement is thus very good\u2014it could not be better\u2014given that both of us [that is, Kepler and Fabricius] work independently and do not rely on the facilities used by Tycho Brahe.","1737":"VIII. On 1595 October 30 at 8h 20m, the planet was found at 17\u00b0 47\u2019 15\u201c Taurus,19 not far from the nonagesimal. We may thus be sure of the parallax, although we must take it into account. The latitude was 0\u00b0 5\u2019 10\u201c north. The sun\u2019s position was 16\u00b0 50\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio. The distance between the stars was 56\u2019 45\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 35\u201c; that of Mars, 22\u2019 54\u201c, as appears by comparing the nearby observations. The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 23\u2019 29\u201c. If the distance between the stars be divided by this, it comes out to 40\u2019 47\u201c of a day, or 16 hours 19 min. Therefore, the true opposition was 0h 39m PM on October 31. Mars\u2019s position was 17\u00b0 31\u2019 40\u201c Taurus. This needs no reduction to the orbit, as it is nearly at the node. The latitude was about 0\u00b0 8\u2019 north. But comparison with the preceding and following days shows a latitude of about 5\u2019 north.\nIX. Let, at any rate, Mars\u2019s position on 1597 December 10 at 8h 30m be 3\u00b0 45\u00bd\u2019 Cancer (as above) ^20. The sun\u2019s position was 29\u00b0 4\u2019 53\u201c Sagittarius. The distance between the stars was 4\u00b0 40\u2019 37\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 61\u2019 20\u201c, that of Mars 23\u2019 40\u201c (for in 1580 the diurnal motion in Gemini was 23\u2019, and in 1582, at 17\u00b0 Cancer, it was 24\u2019). Therefore, the sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 25\u2019 0\u201c. These data show that the time of true opposition followed 3 days 7 hours 14 min. later, on December 14 at 3h 44m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 2\u00b0 27\u2153\u2019 Cancer. The reduction to the orbit (quite ridiculous here, since the observation itself has an uncertainty of several minutes) requires the addition of about 52\u201c. Therefore, the corrected position was 2\u00b0 28\u2019 Cancer. The latitude, from the table, was 3\u00b0 33\u2019 north.\nOn the same night, the one following December 10, at 12\u2159h, Fabricius in East Frisia found Mars\u2019s position to be 3\u00b0 40\u00bc\u2019 Cancer with latitude 3\u00b0 23\u2019 N. In this observation the longitude comes out nearly the same. For the motion over 3h 40m is 3\u00bd\u2019, so that in the Brahean observation too, at 12\u2159h Mars could have been at 3\u00b0 42\u2019 Cancer\u2014two minutes beyond the Fabrician position.\nX. On 1600 January 13\/23 at 11h 40m, the time being adjusted to Uraniborg time, the planet was observed at 10\u00b0 38\u2019 46\u201c Leo ^21. The sun\u2019s position was 3\u00b0 26\u2019 30\u201c Aquarius. The stars were 7\u00b0 12\u2019 16\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion for the next few days was 1\u00b0 1\u2019 3\u201c; that of Mars, 23\u2019 44\u201c. The sum: 1\u00b0 24\u2019 47\u201c. The opposition therefore followed 5 days 2h 22m after; that is, on January 19\/29 at 2h 2m in the morning, before dawn. Mars was at 8\u00b0 38\u2019 Leo. There is no need for reduction, since it is near the limit. The latitude, from the table, was 4\u00b0 30\u2019 50\u201c N.\nXI. On the evening of 1602 Febr. 18\/28 at 10h 30m, using the Tychonic  instruments (with the help of the learned Matthias Seiffard,22 bequeathed us by Tycho), I took the distance of Mars from the middle star of the tail of Ursa Major 23 to be 52\u00b0 22\u2019. And since the distance between Cor Leonis and Procyon was 37\u00b0 22\u2019 20\u201c, which should have been 37\u00b0 19\u2019 50\u201c,24 we know that the sextant reads 2\u00bd minutes high. Therefore, the corrected distance of Mars from the tail of Ursa was 52\u00b0 19\u00bd\u2019. And since the latitude of the fixed star is 56\u00b0 22\u2019, the remainder, by subtraction, is 4\u00b0 2\u00bd\u2019\u2014supposing that Mars was at precisely the same longitude as the fixed star. But because there was a difference of 3\u00be degrees between them (as is clear from the following observations), a slight correction is required.\n For let AB be 3\u00b0 43\u2019 30\u201c on a parallel close to the ecliptic, B Mars, C the fixed star, and BC 52\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c. Dividing the secant of BC by the secant of AB gives the  secant of CA, 52\u00b0 14\u2019, which, subtracted from 56\u00b0 22\u2019 (the latitude of the fixed star) leaves 4\u00b0 8\u2019 north as Mars\u2019s observed latitude. At the same time, we found 19\u00b0 23\u2019 between Mars and Cor Leonis (19\u00b0 20\u00bd corrected), and 21\u00b0 20\u2019 between Mars and the bright star in the wing of Virgo25 (21\u00b0 17\u00bd\u2019 corrected). From these two distances (using the latitudes of the stars and Mars), Mars\u2019s longitude is found to be 13\u00b0 19\u2019 6\u201c Virgo, by consensus of all measurements.\nAlternatively, the meridian altitude of Mars was found at 12h 40m, using two quadrants, to be 50\u00b0 19\u2019, while the tail of Leo26 was 56\u00b0 45\u2019. Therefore, from the declinations and right ascensions of the fixed stars and our distances, Mars\u2019s position is determined as 13\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c Virgo, latitude 4\u00b0 7\u2019 55\u201c ^27. This is the Tychonic procedure. I have included the other for the sake of showing a consensus, and also that it might be evident that despite the lack of absolute perfection in the demonstration, short cuts either in computation or in our understanding can under certain circumstances be applied. For in that previous procedure there is less in the actual work than in the reporting of it. At Prague, 5\u00b0 Scorpio was rising ^28. Therefore, the nonagesimal was about 32\u00bd\u00b0 from the zenith. And since Mars\u2019s distance from the earth was rather more than half the sun\u2019s distance, the resulting parallax of about 5\u2019 opposite 32\u00bd\u00b0 in our parallactic table, shows a latitudinal parallax of 2\u2019 41\u201c. Thus the latitude as seen from the middle of the earth would be 4\u00b0 10\u2154\u2019 north. And because the altitude of the nonagesimal was 57\u00bd\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax at the horizon was 4\u2019 13\u201c. But since Mars was 38\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, the longitudinal parallax corresponding to this position is 2\u2019 36\u201c, and if this be eliminated, Mars would be placed at about 13\u00b0 18\u2019 Virgo ^29. At that moment, the sun\u2019s position was 10\u00b0 16\u2019 42\u201c Pisces. The distance between the bodies was 3\u00b0 1\u2019 18\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 4\u201c, and that of Mars, 24\u2019 5\u201c (for it was 24\u2019 18\u201c at 21\u00b0 Leo in 1585, and 24\u2019 at 26 Virgo in 1587). The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 24\u2019 9\u201c. The true opposition therefore followed 2 days 3 hours 43 minutes later, on 21 February\/3 March before dawn at 2h 13m, Mars being at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 35\u201c Virgo. Forty seconds must be subtracted to reduce the position to the orbit, putting Mars at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 Virgo, with slightly less latitude than before, since the latitude was then decreasing. It was therefore about 4\u00b0 10\u2019, or 4\u00b0 7\u2153\u2019 if the parallax be neglected.\n But because, since Tycho\u2019s death, we have not made frequent observations nor continued them over several days, it would be best, for certainty\u2019s sake, also to make use of those observations which David Fabricius of East Frisia, a sedulous practitioner of astronomy, has communicated to me.\nOn February 16, old style, at 5h in the morning, he took the planet\u2019s distances from the tail of Leo (for the latitude), from the neck of Leo,30 and, on the other hand, from the bright star in the southern wing of Virgo, so as to check its longitude by working it out twice.\nI could make use of Tycho\u2019s line of reasoning, which he routinely adopted in volume I of the Progymnasmata when (as here) the declination of the planet was not known. But because that method extends to ten operations, I prefer for the sake of brevity to proceed as I did before with my own observations. Here there are no hidden dangers.\nFirst, the star in the wing of Virgo, adjusted to our time, is at 4\u00b0 36\u2019 30\u201c Libra with latitude 2\u00b0 50\u2019 north. Fabricius found that Mars is 20\u00b0 18\u2019 westward from it on the zodiac, which puts Mars at about 14\u00b0 18\u2019 30\u201c Virgo. This is a preliminary, approximate figure: the longitude will shortly be corrected. Now the tail of Leo31 is at 16\u00b0 4\u2019 Virgo, with latitude 12\u00b0 18\u2019 North, and Mars was found to be 8\u00b0 17\u2019 distant from the Tail. What is sought is the distance of its parallel from the Tail, since the difference in longitude is 1\u00b0 45\u2019. Dividing the secant of 8\u00b0 17\u2019 by the secant of 1\u00b0 45\u2019 gives the secant of 8\u00b0 6\u2019, the arc sought. This subtracted from the fixed star\u2019s northern latitude of 12\u00b0 18\u2019 leaves Mars\u2019s latitude, 4\u00b0 12\u2019 north. This I now take as determined, and compare it with the latitudes of the fixed stars according to the laws of trigonometry. From the Wing of Virgo, I find Mars\u2019s longitude to be 14\u00b0 19\u2019 Virgo; from the Neck of Leo, 14\u00b0 23\u2019 36\u201c. The mean of these two is 14\u00b0 21\u2019 18\u201c Virgo. And since the sextant gave distances larger than the truth, the latitude would come out at 4\u00b0 14\u2019 north.\nOn the night following February 23, at 12h, he observed Mars in relation to five fixed stars: the Tail of Leo and Arcturus for latitude, and for the longitude, in the first instance, Spica (which followed it), and, in the second, the Neck of Leo and Cor Leonis (which preceded it).\nBy a rough estimate, I foresee that Mars is going to fall at 11\u00bc\u00b0 Virgo. It was found to be 9\u00b0 24\u2019 from the Tail of Leo, and hence, its latitude comes out at 4\u00b0 6\u2019 ^32. And now, through this and the latitudes of the fixed stars, together with their distances (17\u00b0 26\u2019 from Regulus, 17\u00b0 51\u2019 from the Neck of Leo, 37\u00b0 28\u2019 from Spica, 44\u00b0 15\u2019 from Arcturus), Mars\u2019s position comes out at 11\u00b0 21\u2019 23\u201c Virgo (from Regulus), 11\u00b0 20\u2019 52\u201c Virgo (from the Neck of Leo), and 11\u00b0 17\u2019 40\u201c (from Spica). Again (as you see) the distances err in being too great. For from the Heart and the Neck [of Leo], Mars is pushed a little eastward, and from Spica and Arcturus a little westward, and more from Arcturus, owing to its greater northern latitude ^33. The mean (ignoring Arcturus), 11\u00b0 19\u2019 20\u201c Virgo, is very nearly true. Also, the latitude is greater, namely, 4\u00b0 7\u2019 40\u201c north. Now from February 15 at 17h to 23 February at 12h, a period of 7 days 19 hours, Mars moved 3\u00b0 0\u2019: 180 minutes in 187 hours. That is, about one minute per hour. And if you wish to take it into account, the parallax (if any) is subtracted from the longitude on February 16 and a little is added on February 23.\n Because the last observation follows the time of observation found by me by 2 days 21 hours 47 min., add the motion corresponding to this time, 1\u00b0 7\u2019: the position will come out 12\u00b0 26\u2019 Virgo. The agreement is thus very good\u2014it could not be better\u2014given that both of us [that is, Kepler and Fabricius] work independently and do not rely on the facilities used by Tycho Brahe.","1738":"VIII. On 1595 October 30 at 8h 20m, the planet was found at 17\u00b0 47\u2019 15\u201c Taurus,19 not far from the nonagesimal. We may thus be sure of the parallax, although we must take it into account. The latitude was 0\u00b0 5\u2019 10\u201c north. The sun\u2019s position was 16\u00b0 50\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio. The distance between the stars was 56\u2019 45\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 35\u201c; that of Mars, 22\u2019 54\u201c, as appears by comparing the nearby observations. The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 23\u2019 29\u201c. If the distance between the stars be divided by this, it comes out to 40\u2019 47\u201c of a day, or 16 hours 19 min. Therefore, the true opposition was 0h 39m PM on October 31. Mars\u2019s position was 17\u00b0 31\u2019 40\u201c Taurus. This needs no reduction to the orbit, as it is nearly at the node. The latitude was about 0\u00b0 8\u2019 north. But comparison with the preceding and following days shows a latitude of about 5\u2019 north.\nIX. Let, at any rate, Mars\u2019s position on 1597 December 10 at 8h 30m be 3\u00b0 45\u00bd\u2019 Cancer (as above) ^20. The sun\u2019s position was 29\u00b0 4\u2019 53\u201c Sagittarius. The distance between the stars was 4\u00b0 40\u2019 37\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 61\u2019 20\u201c, that of Mars 23\u2019 40\u201c (for in 1580 the diurnal motion in Gemini was 23\u2019, and in 1582, at 17\u00b0 Cancer, it was 24\u2019). Therefore, the sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 25\u2019 0\u201c. These data show that the time of true opposition followed 3 days 7 hours 14 min. later, on December 14 at 3h 44m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 2\u00b0 27\u2153\u2019 Cancer. The reduction to the orbit (quite ridiculous here, since the observation itself has an uncertainty of several minutes) requires the addition of about 52\u201c. Therefore, the corrected position was 2\u00b0 28\u2019 Cancer. The latitude, from the table, was 3\u00b0 33\u2019 north.\nOn the same night, the one following December 10, at 12\u2159h, Fabricius in East Frisia found Mars\u2019s position to be 3\u00b0 40\u00bc\u2019 Cancer with latitude 3\u00b0 23\u2019 N. In this observation the longitude comes out nearly the same. For the motion over 3h 40m is 3\u00bd\u2019, so that in the Brahean observation too, at 12\u2159h Mars could have been at 3\u00b0 42\u2019 Cancer\u2014two minutes beyond the Fabrician position.\nX. On 1600 January 13\/23 at 11h 40m, the time being adjusted to Uraniborg time, the planet was observed at 10\u00b0 38\u2019 46\u201c Leo ^21. The sun\u2019s position was 3\u00b0 26\u2019 30\u201c Aquarius. The stars were 7\u00b0 12\u2019 16\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion for the next few days was 1\u00b0 1\u2019 3\u201c; that of Mars, 23\u2019 44\u201c. The sum: 1\u00b0 24\u2019 47\u201c. The opposition therefore followed 5 days 2h 22m after; that is, on January 19\/29 at 2h 2m in the morning, before dawn. Mars was at 8\u00b0 38\u2019 Leo. There is no need for reduction, since it is near the limit. The latitude, from the table, was 4\u00b0 30\u2019 50\u201c N.\nXI. On the evening of 1602 Febr. 18\/28 at 10h 30m, using the Tychonic  instruments (with the help of the learned Matthias Seiffard,22 bequeathed us by Tycho), I took the distance of Mars from the middle star of the tail of Ursa Major 23 to be 52\u00b0 22\u2019. And since the distance between Cor Leonis and Procyon was 37\u00b0 22\u2019 20\u201c, which should have been 37\u00b0 19\u2019 50\u201c,24 we know that the sextant reads 2\u00bd minutes high. Therefore, the corrected distance of Mars from the tail of Ursa was 52\u00b0 19\u00bd\u2019. And since the latitude of the fixed star is 56\u00b0 22\u2019, the remainder, by subtraction, is 4\u00b0 2\u00bd\u2019\u2014supposing that Mars was at precisely the same longitude as the fixed star. But because there was a difference of 3\u00be degrees between them (as is clear from the following observations), a slight correction is required.\n For let AB be 3\u00b0 43\u2019 30\u201c on a parallel close to the ecliptic, B Mars, C the fixed star, and BC 52\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c. Dividing the secant of BC by the secant of AB gives the  secant of CA, 52\u00b0 14\u2019, which, subtracted from 56\u00b0 22\u2019 (the latitude of the fixed star) leaves 4\u00b0 8\u2019 north as Mars\u2019s observed latitude. At the same time, we found 19\u00b0 23\u2019 between Mars and Cor Leonis (19\u00b0 20\u00bd corrected), and 21\u00b0 20\u2019 between Mars and the bright star in the wing of Virgo25 (21\u00b0 17\u00bd\u2019 corrected). From these two distances (using the latitudes of the stars and Mars), Mars\u2019s longitude is found to be 13\u00b0 19\u2019 6\u201c Virgo, by consensus of all measurements.\nAlternatively, the meridian altitude of Mars was found at 12h 40m, using two quadrants, to be 50\u00b0 19\u2019, while the tail of Leo26 was 56\u00b0 45\u2019. Therefore, from the declinations and right ascensions of the fixed stars and our distances, Mars\u2019s position is determined as 13\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c Virgo, latitude 4\u00b0 7\u2019 55\u201c ^27. This is the Tychonic procedure. I have included the other for the sake of showing a consensus, and also that it might be evident that despite the lack of absolute perfection in the demonstration, short cuts either in computation or in our understanding can under certain circumstances be applied. For in that previous procedure there is less in the actual work than in the reporting of it. At Prague, 5\u00b0 Scorpio was rising ^28. Therefore, the nonagesimal was about 32\u00bd\u00b0 from the zenith. And since Mars\u2019s distance from the earth was rather more than half the sun\u2019s distance, the resulting parallax of about 5\u2019 opposite 32\u00bd\u00b0 in our parallactic table, shows a latitudinal parallax of 2\u2019 41\u201c. Thus the latitude as seen from the middle of the earth would be 4\u00b0 10\u2154\u2019 north. And because the altitude of the nonagesimal was 57\u00bd\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax at the horizon was 4\u2019 13\u201c. But since Mars was 38\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, the longitudinal parallax corresponding to this position is 2\u2019 36\u201c, and if this be eliminated, Mars would be placed at about 13\u00b0 18\u2019 Virgo ^29. At that moment, the sun\u2019s position was 10\u00b0 16\u2019 42\u201c Pisces. The distance between the bodies was 3\u00b0 1\u2019 18\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 4\u201c, and that of Mars, 24\u2019 5\u201c (for it was 24\u2019 18\u201c at 21\u00b0 Leo in 1585, and 24\u2019 at 26 Virgo in 1587). The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 24\u2019 9\u201c. The true opposition therefore followed 2 days 3 hours 43 minutes later, on 21 February\/3 March before dawn at 2h 13m, Mars being at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 35\u201c Virgo. Forty seconds must be subtracted to reduce the position to the orbit, putting Mars at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 Virgo, with slightly less latitude than before, since the latitude was then decreasing. It was therefore about 4\u00b0 10\u2019, or 4\u00b0 7\u2153\u2019 if the parallax be neglected.\n But because, since Tycho\u2019s death, we have not made frequent observations nor continued them over several days, it would be best, for certainty\u2019s sake, also to make use of those observations which David Fabricius of East Frisia, a sedulous practitioner of astronomy, has communicated to me.\nOn February 16, old style, at 5h in the morning, he took the planet\u2019s distances from the tail of Leo (for the latitude), from the neck of Leo,30 and, on the other hand, from the bright star in the southern wing of Virgo, so as to check its longitude by working it out twice.\nI could make use of Tycho\u2019s line of reasoning, which he routinely adopted in volume I of the Progymnasmata when (as here) the declination of the planet was not known. But because that method extends to ten operations, I prefer for the sake of brevity to proceed as I did before with my own observations. Here there are no hidden dangers.\nFirst, the star in the wing of Virgo, adjusted to our time, is at 4\u00b0 36\u2019 30\u201c Libra with latitude 2\u00b0 50\u2019 north. Fabricius found that Mars is 20\u00b0 18\u2019 westward from it on the zodiac, which puts Mars at about 14\u00b0 18\u2019 30\u201c Virgo. This is a preliminary, approximate figure: the longitude will shortly be corrected. Now the tail of Leo31 is at 16\u00b0 4\u2019 Virgo, with latitude 12\u00b0 18\u2019 North, and Mars was found to be 8\u00b0 17\u2019 distant from the Tail. What is sought is the distance of its parallel from the Tail, since the difference in longitude is 1\u00b0 45\u2019. Dividing the secant of 8\u00b0 17\u2019 by the secant of 1\u00b0 45\u2019 gives the secant of 8\u00b0 6\u2019, the arc sought. This subtracted from the fixed star\u2019s northern latitude of 12\u00b0 18\u2019 leaves Mars\u2019s latitude, 4\u00b0 12\u2019 north. This I now take as determined, and compare it with the latitudes of the fixed stars according to the laws of trigonometry. From the Wing of Virgo, I find Mars\u2019s longitude to be 14\u00b0 19\u2019 Virgo; from the Neck of Leo, 14\u00b0 23\u2019 36\u201c. The mean of these two is 14\u00b0 21\u2019 18\u201c Virgo. And since the sextant gave distances larger than the truth, the latitude would come out at 4\u00b0 14\u2019 north.\nOn the night following February 23, at 12h, he observed Mars in relation to five fixed stars: the Tail of Leo and Arcturus for latitude, and for the longitude, in the first instance, Spica (which followed it), and, in the second, the Neck of Leo and Cor Leonis (which preceded it).\nBy a rough estimate, I foresee that Mars is going to fall at 11\u00bc\u00b0 Virgo. It was found to be 9\u00b0 24\u2019 from the Tail of Leo, and hence, its latitude comes out at 4\u00b0 6\u2019 ^32. And now, through this and the latitudes of the fixed stars, together with their distances (17\u00b0 26\u2019 from Regulus, 17\u00b0 51\u2019 from the Neck of Leo, 37\u00b0 28\u2019 from Spica, 44\u00b0 15\u2019 from Arcturus), Mars\u2019s position comes out at 11\u00b0 21\u2019 23\u201c Virgo (from Regulus), 11\u00b0 20\u2019 52\u201c Virgo (from the Neck of Leo), and 11\u00b0 17\u2019 40\u201c (from Spica). Again (as you see) the distances err in being too great. For from the Heart and the Neck [of Leo], Mars is pushed a little eastward, and from Spica and Arcturus a little westward, and more from Arcturus, owing to its greater northern latitude ^33. The mean (ignoring Arcturus), 11\u00b0 19\u2019 20\u201c Virgo, is very nearly true. Also, the latitude is greater, namely, 4\u00b0 7\u2019 40\u201c north. Now from February 15 at 17h to 23 February at 12h, a period of 7 days 19 hours, Mars moved 3\u00b0 0\u2019: 180 minutes in 187 hours. That is, about one minute per hour. And if you wish to take it into account, the parallax (if any) is subtracted from the longitude on February 16 and a little is added on February 23.\n Because the last observation follows the time of observation found by me by 2 days 21 hours 47 min., add the motion corresponding to this time, 1\u00b0 7\u2019: the position will come out 12\u00b0 26\u2019 Virgo. The agreement is thus very good\u2014it could not be better\u2014given that both of us [that is, Kepler and Fabricius] work independently and do not rely on the facilities used by Tycho Brahe.","1739":"VIII. On 1595 October 30 at 8h 20m, the planet was found at 17\u00b0 47\u2019 15\u201c Taurus,19 not far from the nonagesimal. We may thus be sure of the parallax, although we must take it into account. The latitude was 0\u00b0 5\u2019 10\u201c north. The sun\u2019s position was 16\u00b0 50\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio. The distance between the stars was 56\u2019 45\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 35\u201c; that of Mars, 22\u2019 54\u201c, as appears by comparing the nearby observations. The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 23\u2019 29\u201c. If the distance between the stars be divided by this, it comes out to 40\u2019 47\u201c of a day, or 16 hours 19 min. Therefore, the true opposition was 0h 39m PM on October 31. Mars\u2019s position was 17\u00b0 31\u2019 40\u201c Taurus. This needs no reduction to the orbit, as it is nearly at the node. The latitude was about 0\u00b0 8\u2019 north. But comparison with the preceding and following days shows a latitude of about 5\u2019 north.\nIX. Let, at any rate, Mars\u2019s position on 1597 December 10 at 8h 30m be 3\u00b0 45\u00bd\u2019 Cancer (as above) ^20. The sun\u2019s position was 29\u00b0 4\u2019 53\u201c Sagittarius. The distance between the stars was 4\u00b0 40\u2019 37\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 61\u2019 20\u201c, that of Mars 23\u2019 40\u201c (for in 1580 the diurnal motion in Gemini was 23\u2019, and in 1582, at 17\u00b0 Cancer, it was 24\u2019). Therefore, the sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 25\u2019 0\u201c. These data show that the time of true opposition followed 3 days 7 hours 14 min. later, on December 14 at 3h 44m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 2\u00b0 27\u2153\u2019 Cancer. The reduction to the orbit (quite ridiculous here, since the observation itself has an uncertainty of several minutes) requires the addition of about 52\u201c. Therefore, the corrected position was 2\u00b0 28\u2019 Cancer. The latitude, from the table, was 3\u00b0 33\u2019 north.\nOn the same night, the one following December 10, at 12\u2159h, Fabricius in East Frisia found Mars\u2019s position to be 3\u00b0 40\u00bc\u2019 Cancer with latitude 3\u00b0 23\u2019 N. In this observation the longitude comes out nearly the same. For the motion over 3h 40m is 3\u00bd\u2019, so that in the Brahean observation too, at 12\u2159h Mars could have been at 3\u00b0 42\u2019 Cancer\u2014two minutes beyond the Fabrician position.\nX. On 1600 January 13\/23 at 11h 40m, the time being adjusted to Uraniborg time, the planet was observed at 10\u00b0 38\u2019 46\u201c Leo ^21. The sun\u2019s position was 3\u00b0 26\u2019 30\u201c Aquarius. The stars were 7\u00b0 12\u2019 16\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion for the next few days was 1\u00b0 1\u2019 3\u201c; that of Mars, 23\u2019 44\u201c. The sum: 1\u00b0 24\u2019 47\u201c. The opposition therefore followed 5 days 2h 22m after; that is, on January 19\/29 at 2h 2m in the morning, before dawn. Mars was at 8\u00b0 38\u2019 Leo. There is no need for reduction, since it is near the limit. The latitude, from the table, was 4\u00b0 30\u2019 50\u201c N.\nXI. On the evening of 1602 Febr. 18\/28 at 10h 30m, using the Tychonic  instruments (with the help of the learned Matthias Seiffard,22 bequeathed us by Tycho), I took the distance of Mars from the middle star of the tail of Ursa Major 23 to be 52\u00b0 22\u2019. And since the distance between Cor Leonis and Procyon was 37\u00b0 22\u2019 20\u201c, which should have been 37\u00b0 19\u2019 50\u201c,24 we know that the sextant reads 2\u00bd minutes high. Therefore, the corrected distance of Mars from the tail of Ursa was 52\u00b0 19\u00bd\u2019. And since the latitude of the fixed star is 56\u00b0 22\u2019, the remainder, by subtraction, is 4\u00b0 2\u00bd\u2019\u2014supposing that Mars was at precisely the same longitude as the fixed star. But because there was a difference of 3\u00be degrees between them (as is clear from the following observations), a slight correction is required.\n For let AB be 3\u00b0 43\u2019 30\u201c on a parallel close to the ecliptic, B Mars, C the fixed star, and BC 52\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c. Dividing the secant of BC by the secant of AB gives the  secant of CA, 52\u00b0 14\u2019, which, subtracted from 56\u00b0 22\u2019 (the latitude of the fixed star) leaves 4\u00b0 8\u2019 north as Mars\u2019s observed latitude. At the same time, we found 19\u00b0 23\u2019 between Mars and Cor Leonis (19\u00b0 20\u00bd corrected), and 21\u00b0 20\u2019 between Mars and the bright star in the wing of Virgo25 (21\u00b0 17\u00bd\u2019 corrected). From these two distances (using the latitudes of the stars and Mars), Mars\u2019s longitude is found to be 13\u00b0 19\u2019 6\u201c Virgo, by consensus of all measurements.\nAlternatively, the meridian altitude of Mars was found at 12h 40m, using two quadrants, to be 50\u00b0 19\u2019, while the tail of Leo26 was 56\u00b0 45\u2019. Therefore, from the declinations and right ascensions of the fixed stars and our distances, Mars\u2019s position is determined as 13\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c Virgo, latitude 4\u00b0 7\u2019 55\u201c ^27. This is the Tychonic procedure. I have included the other for the sake of showing a consensus, and also that it might be evident that despite the lack of absolute perfection in the demonstration, short cuts either in computation or in our understanding can under certain circumstances be applied. For in that previous procedure there is less in the actual work than in the reporting of it. At Prague, 5\u00b0 Scorpio was rising ^28. Therefore, the nonagesimal was about 32\u00bd\u00b0 from the zenith. And since Mars\u2019s distance from the earth was rather more than half the sun\u2019s distance, the resulting parallax of about 5\u2019 opposite 32\u00bd\u00b0 in our parallactic table, shows a latitudinal parallax of 2\u2019 41\u201c. Thus the latitude as seen from the middle of the earth would be 4\u00b0 10\u2154\u2019 north. And because the altitude of the nonagesimal was 57\u00bd\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax at the horizon was 4\u2019 13\u201c. But since Mars was 38\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, the longitudinal parallax corresponding to this position is 2\u2019 36\u201c, and if this be eliminated, Mars would be placed at about 13\u00b0 18\u2019 Virgo ^29. At that moment, the sun\u2019s position was 10\u00b0 16\u2019 42\u201c Pisces. The distance between the bodies was 3\u00b0 1\u2019 18\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 4\u201c, and that of Mars, 24\u2019 5\u201c (for it was 24\u2019 18\u201c at 21\u00b0 Leo in 1585, and 24\u2019 at 26 Virgo in 1587). The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 24\u2019 9\u201c. The true opposition therefore followed 2 days 3 hours 43 minutes later, on 21 February\/3 March before dawn at 2h 13m, Mars being at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 35\u201c Virgo. Forty seconds must be subtracted to reduce the position to the orbit, putting Mars at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 Virgo, with slightly less latitude than before, since the latitude was then decreasing. It was therefore about 4\u00b0 10\u2019, or 4\u00b0 7\u2153\u2019 if the parallax be neglected.\n But because, since Tycho\u2019s death, we have not made frequent observations nor continued them over several days, it would be best, for certainty\u2019s sake, also to make use of those observations which David Fabricius of East Frisia, a sedulous practitioner of astronomy, has communicated to me.\nOn February 16, old style, at 5h in the morning, he took the planet\u2019s distances from the tail of Leo (for the latitude), from the neck of Leo,30 and, on the other hand, from the bright star in the southern wing of Virgo, so as to check its longitude by working it out twice.\nI could make use of Tycho\u2019s line of reasoning, which he routinely adopted in volume I of the Progymnasmata when (as here) the declination of the planet was not known. But because that method extends to ten operations, I prefer for the sake of brevity to proceed as I did before with my own observations. Here there are no hidden dangers.\nFirst, the star in the wing of Virgo, adjusted to our time, is at 4\u00b0 36\u2019 30\u201c Libra with latitude 2\u00b0 50\u2019 north. Fabricius found that Mars is 20\u00b0 18\u2019 westward from it on the zodiac, which puts Mars at about 14\u00b0 18\u2019 30\u201c Virgo. This is a preliminary, approximate figure: the longitude will shortly be corrected. Now the tail of Leo31 is at 16\u00b0 4\u2019 Virgo, with latitude 12\u00b0 18\u2019 North, and Mars was found to be 8\u00b0 17\u2019 distant from the Tail. What is sought is the distance of its parallel from the Tail, since the difference in longitude is 1\u00b0 45\u2019. Dividing the secant of 8\u00b0 17\u2019 by the secant of 1\u00b0 45\u2019 gives the secant of 8\u00b0 6\u2019, the arc sought. This subtracted from the fixed star\u2019s northern latitude of 12\u00b0 18\u2019 leaves Mars\u2019s latitude, 4\u00b0 12\u2019 north. This I now take as determined, and compare it with the latitudes of the fixed stars according to the laws of trigonometry. From the Wing of Virgo, I find Mars\u2019s longitude to be 14\u00b0 19\u2019 Virgo; from the Neck of Leo, 14\u00b0 23\u2019 36\u201c. The mean of these two is 14\u00b0 21\u2019 18\u201c Virgo. And since the sextant gave distances larger than the truth, the latitude would come out at 4\u00b0 14\u2019 north.\nOn the night following February 23, at 12h, he observed Mars in relation to five fixed stars: the Tail of Leo and Arcturus for latitude, and for the longitude, in the first instance, Spica (which followed it), and, in the second, the Neck of Leo and Cor Leonis (which preceded it).\nBy a rough estimate, I foresee that Mars is going to fall at 11\u00bc\u00b0 Virgo. It was found to be 9\u00b0 24\u2019 from the Tail of Leo, and hence, its latitude comes out at 4\u00b0 6\u2019 ^32. And now, through this and the latitudes of the fixed stars, together with their distances (17\u00b0 26\u2019 from Regulus, 17\u00b0 51\u2019 from the Neck of Leo, 37\u00b0 28\u2019 from Spica, 44\u00b0 15\u2019 from Arcturus), Mars\u2019s position comes out at 11\u00b0 21\u2019 23\u201c Virgo (from Regulus), 11\u00b0 20\u2019 52\u201c Virgo (from the Neck of Leo), and 11\u00b0 17\u2019 40\u201c (from Spica). Again (as you see) the distances err in being too great. For from the Heart and the Neck [of Leo], Mars is pushed a little eastward, and from Spica and Arcturus a little westward, and more from Arcturus, owing to its greater northern latitude ^33. The mean (ignoring Arcturus), 11\u00b0 19\u2019 20\u201c Virgo, is very nearly true. Also, the latitude is greater, namely, 4\u00b0 7\u2019 40\u201c north. Now from February 15 at 17h to 23 February at 12h, a period of 7 days 19 hours, Mars moved 3\u00b0 0\u2019: 180 minutes in 187 hours. That is, about one minute per hour. And if you wish to take it into account, the parallax (if any) is subtracted from the longitude on February 16 and a little is added on February 23.\n Because the last observation follows the time of observation found by me by 2 days 21 hours 47 min., add the motion corresponding to this time, 1\u00b0 7\u2019: the position will come out 12\u00b0 26\u2019 Virgo. The agreement is thus very good\u2014it could not be better\u2014given that both of us [that is, Kepler and Fabricius] work independently and do not rely on the facilities used by Tycho Brahe.","1740":"VIII. On 1595 October 30 at 8h 20m, the planet was found at 17\u00b0 47\u2019 15\u201c Taurus,19 not far from the nonagesimal. We may thus be sure of the parallax, although we must take it into account. The latitude was 0\u00b0 5\u2019 10\u201c north. The sun\u2019s position was 16\u00b0 50\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio. The distance between the stars was 56\u2019 45\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 35\u201c; that of Mars, 22\u2019 54\u201c, as appears by comparing the nearby observations. The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 23\u2019 29\u201c. If the distance between the stars be divided by this, it comes out to 40\u2019 47\u201c of a day, or 16 hours 19 min. Therefore, the true opposition was 0h 39m PM on October 31. Mars\u2019s position was 17\u00b0 31\u2019 40\u201c Taurus. This needs no reduction to the orbit, as it is nearly at the node. The latitude was about 0\u00b0 8\u2019 north. But comparison with the preceding and following days shows a latitude of about 5\u2019 north.\nIX. Let, at any rate, Mars\u2019s position on 1597 December 10 at 8h 30m be 3\u00b0 45\u00bd\u2019 Cancer (as above) ^20. The sun\u2019s position was 29\u00b0 4\u2019 53\u201c Sagittarius. The distance between the stars was 4\u00b0 40\u2019 37\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 61\u2019 20\u201c, that of Mars 23\u2019 40\u201c (for in 1580 the diurnal motion in Gemini was 23\u2019, and in 1582, at 17\u00b0 Cancer, it was 24\u2019). Therefore, the sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 25\u2019 0\u201c. These data show that the time of true opposition followed 3 days 7 hours 14 min. later, on December 14 at 3h 44m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 2\u00b0 27\u2153\u2019 Cancer. The reduction to the orbit (quite ridiculous here, since the observation itself has an uncertainty of several minutes) requires the addition of about 52\u201c. Therefore, the corrected position was 2\u00b0 28\u2019 Cancer. The latitude, from the table, was 3\u00b0 33\u2019 north.\nOn the same night, the one following December 10, at 12\u2159h, Fabricius in East Frisia found Mars\u2019s position to be 3\u00b0 40\u00bc\u2019 Cancer with latitude 3\u00b0 23\u2019 N. In this observation the longitude comes out nearly the same. For the motion over 3h 40m is 3\u00bd\u2019, so that in the Brahean observation too, at 12\u2159h Mars could have been at 3\u00b0 42\u2019 Cancer\u2014two minutes beyond the Fabrician position.\nX. On 1600 January 13\/23 at 11h 40m, the time being adjusted to Uraniborg time, the planet was observed at 10\u00b0 38\u2019 46\u201c Leo ^21. The sun\u2019s position was 3\u00b0 26\u2019 30\u201c Aquarius. The stars were 7\u00b0 12\u2019 16\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion for the next few days was 1\u00b0 1\u2019 3\u201c; that of Mars, 23\u2019 44\u201c. The sum: 1\u00b0 24\u2019 47\u201c. The opposition therefore followed 5 days 2h 22m after; that is, on January 19\/29 at 2h 2m in the morning, before dawn. Mars was at 8\u00b0 38\u2019 Leo. There is no need for reduction, since it is near the limit. The latitude, from the table, was 4\u00b0 30\u2019 50\u201c N.\nXI. On the evening of 1602 Febr. 18\/28 at 10h 30m, using the Tychonic  instruments (with the help of the learned Matthias Seiffard,22 bequeathed us by Tycho), I took the distance of Mars from the middle star of the tail of Ursa Major 23 to be 52\u00b0 22\u2019. And since the distance between Cor Leonis and Procyon was 37\u00b0 22\u2019 20\u201c, which should have been 37\u00b0 19\u2019 50\u201c,24 we know that the sextant reads 2\u00bd minutes high. Therefore, the corrected distance of Mars from the tail of Ursa was 52\u00b0 19\u00bd\u2019. And since the latitude of the fixed star is 56\u00b0 22\u2019, the remainder, by subtraction, is 4\u00b0 2\u00bd\u2019\u2014supposing that Mars was at precisely the same longitude as the fixed star. But because there was a difference of 3\u00be degrees between them (as is clear from the following observations), a slight correction is required.\n For let AB be 3\u00b0 43\u2019 30\u201c on a parallel close to the ecliptic, B Mars, C the fixed star, and BC 52\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c. Dividing the secant of BC by the secant of AB gives the  secant of CA, 52\u00b0 14\u2019, which, subtracted from 56\u00b0 22\u2019 (the latitude of the fixed star) leaves 4\u00b0 8\u2019 north as Mars\u2019s observed latitude. At the same time, we found 19\u00b0 23\u2019 between Mars and Cor Leonis (19\u00b0 20\u00bd corrected), and 21\u00b0 20\u2019 between Mars and the bright star in the wing of Virgo25 (21\u00b0 17\u00bd\u2019 corrected). From these two distances (using the latitudes of the stars and Mars), Mars\u2019s longitude is found to be 13\u00b0 19\u2019 6\u201c Virgo, by consensus of all measurements.\nAlternatively, the meridian altitude of Mars was found at 12h 40m, using two quadrants, to be 50\u00b0 19\u2019, while the tail of Leo26 was 56\u00b0 45\u2019. Therefore, from the declinations and right ascensions of the fixed stars and our distances, Mars\u2019s position is determined as 13\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c Virgo, latitude 4\u00b0 7\u2019 55\u201c ^27. This is the Tychonic procedure. I have included the other for the sake of showing a consensus, and also that it might be evident that despite the lack of absolute perfection in the demonstration, short cuts either in computation or in our understanding can under certain circumstances be applied. For in that previous procedure there is less in the actual work than in the reporting of it. At Prague, 5\u00b0 Scorpio was rising ^28. Therefore, the nonagesimal was about 32\u00bd\u00b0 from the zenith. And since Mars\u2019s distance from the earth was rather more than half the sun\u2019s distance, the resulting parallax of about 5\u2019 opposite 32\u00bd\u00b0 in our parallactic table, shows a latitudinal parallax of 2\u2019 41\u201c. Thus the latitude as seen from the middle of the earth would be 4\u00b0 10\u2154\u2019 north. And because the altitude of the nonagesimal was 57\u00bd\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax at the horizon was 4\u2019 13\u201c. But since Mars was 38\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, the longitudinal parallax corresponding to this position is 2\u2019 36\u201c, and if this be eliminated, Mars would be placed at about 13\u00b0 18\u2019 Virgo ^29. At that moment, the sun\u2019s position was 10\u00b0 16\u2019 42\u201c Pisces. The distance between the bodies was 3\u00b0 1\u2019 18\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 4\u201c, and that of Mars, 24\u2019 5\u201c (for it was 24\u2019 18\u201c at 21\u00b0 Leo in 1585, and 24\u2019 at 26 Virgo in 1587). The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 24\u2019 9\u201c. The true opposition therefore followed 2 days 3 hours 43 minutes later, on 21 February\/3 March before dawn at 2h 13m, Mars being at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 35\u201c Virgo. Forty seconds must be subtracted to reduce the position to the orbit, putting Mars at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 Virgo, with slightly less latitude than before, since the latitude was then decreasing. It was therefore about 4\u00b0 10\u2019, or 4\u00b0 7\u2153\u2019 if the parallax be neglected.\n But because, since Tycho\u2019s death, we have not made frequent observations nor continued them over several days, it would be best, for certainty\u2019s sake, also to make use of those observations which David Fabricius of East Frisia, a sedulous practitioner of astronomy, has communicated to me.\nOn February 16, old style, at 5h in the morning, he took the planet\u2019s distances from the tail of Leo (for the latitude), from the neck of Leo,30 and, on the other hand, from the bright star in the southern wing of Virgo, so as to check its longitude by working it out twice.\nI could make use of Tycho\u2019s line of reasoning, which he routinely adopted in volume I of the Progymnasmata when (as here) the declination of the planet was not known. But because that method extends to ten operations, I prefer for the sake of brevity to proceed as I did before with my own observations. Here there are no hidden dangers.\nFirst, the star in the wing of Virgo, adjusted to our time, is at 4\u00b0 36\u2019 30\u201c Libra with latitude 2\u00b0 50\u2019 north. Fabricius found that Mars is 20\u00b0 18\u2019 westward from it on the zodiac, which puts Mars at about 14\u00b0 18\u2019 30\u201c Virgo. This is a preliminary, approximate figure: the longitude will shortly be corrected. Now the tail of Leo31 is at 16\u00b0 4\u2019 Virgo, with latitude 12\u00b0 18\u2019 North, and Mars was found to be 8\u00b0 17\u2019 distant from the Tail. What is sought is the distance of its parallel from the Tail, since the difference in longitude is 1\u00b0 45\u2019. Dividing the secant of 8\u00b0 17\u2019 by the secant of 1\u00b0 45\u2019 gives the secant of 8\u00b0 6\u2019, the arc sought. This subtracted from the fixed star\u2019s northern latitude of 12\u00b0 18\u2019 leaves Mars\u2019s latitude, 4\u00b0 12\u2019 north. This I now take as determined, and compare it with the latitudes of the fixed stars according to the laws of trigonometry. From the Wing of Virgo, I find Mars\u2019s longitude to be 14\u00b0 19\u2019 Virgo; from the Neck of Leo, 14\u00b0 23\u2019 36\u201c. The mean of these two is 14\u00b0 21\u2019 18\u201c Virgo. And since the sextant gave distances larger than the truth, the latitude would come out at 4\u00b0 14\u2019 north.\nOn the night following February 23, at 12h, he observed Mars in relation to five fixed stars: the Tail of Leo and Arcturus for latitude, and for the longitude, in the first instance, Spica (which followed it), and, in the second, the Neck of Leo and Cor Leonis (which preceded it).\nBy a rough estimate, I foresee that Mars is going to fall at 11\u00bc\u00b0 Virgo. It was found to be 9\u00b0 24\u2019 from the Tail of Leo, and hence, its latitude comes out at 4\u00b0 6\u2019 ^32. And now, through this and the latitudes of the fixed stars, together with their distances (17\u00b0 26\u2019 from Regulus, 17\u00b0 51\u2019 from the Neck of Leo, 37\u00b0 28\u2019 from Spica, 44\u00b0 15\u2019 from Arcturus), Mars\u2019s position comes out at 11\u00b0 21\u2019 23\u201c Virgo (from Regulus), 11\u00b0 20\u2019 52\u201c Virgo (from the Neck of Leo), and 11\u00b0 17\u2019 40\u201c (from Spica). Again (as you see) the distances err in being too great. For from the Heart and the Neck [of Leo], Mars is pushed a little eastward, and from Spica and Arcturus a little westward, and more from Arcturus, owing to its greater northern latitude ^33. The mean (ignoring Arcturus), 11\u00b0 19\u2019 20\u201c Virgo, is very nearly true. Also, the latitude is greater, namely, 4\u00b0 7\u2019 40\u201c north. Now from February 15 at 17h to 23 February at 12h, a period of 7 days 19 hours, Mars moved 3\u00b0 0\u2019: 180 minutes in 187 hours. That is, about one minute per hour. And if you wish to take it into account, the parallax (if any) is subtracted from the longitude on February 16 and a little is added on February 23.\n Because the last observation follows the time of observation found by me by 2 days 21 hours 47 min., add the motion corresponding to this time, 1\u00b0 7\u2019: the position will come out 12\u00b0 26\u2019 Virgo. The agreement is thus very good\u2014it could not be better\u2014given that both of us [that is, Kepler and Fabricius] work independently and do not rely on the facilities used by Tycho Brahe.","1741":"VIII. On 1595 October 30 at 8h 20m, the planet was found at 17\u00b0 47\u2019 15\u201c Taurus,19 not far from the nonagesimal. We may thus be sure of the parallax, although we must take it into account. The latitude was 0\u00b0 5\u2019 10\u201c north. The sun\u2019s position was 16\u00b0 50\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio. The distance between the stars was 56\u2019 45\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 35\u201c; that of Mars, 22\u2019 54\u201c, as appears by comparing the nearby observations. The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 23\u2019 29\u201c. If the distance between the stars be divided by this, it comes out to 40\u2019 47\u201c of a day, or 16 hours 19 min. Therefore, the true opposition was 0h 39m PM on October 31. Mars\u2019s position was 17\u00b0 31\u2019 40\u201c Taurus. This needs no reduction to the orbit, as it is nearly at the node. The latitude was about 0\u00b0 8\u2019 north. But comparison with the preceding and following days shows a latitude of about 5\u2019 north.\nIX. Let, at any rate, Mars\u2019s position on 1597 December 10 at 8h 30m be 3\u00b0 45\u00bd\u2019 Cancer (as above) ^20. The sun\u2019s position was 29\u00b0 4\u2019 53\u201c Sagittarius. The distance between the stars was 4\u00b0 40\u2019 37\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 61\u2019 20\u201c, that of Mars 23\u2019 40\u201c (for in 1580 the diurnal motion in Gemini was 23\u2019, and in 1582, at 17\u00b0 Cancer, it was 24\u2019). Therefore, the sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 25\u2019 0\u201c. These data show that the time of true opposition followed 3 days 7 hours 14 min. later, on December 14 at 3h 44m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 2\u00b0 27\u2153\u2019 Cancer. The reduction to the orbit (quite ridiculous here, since the observation itself has an uncertainty of several minutes) requires the addition of about 52\u201c. Therefore, the corrected position was 2\u00b0 28\u2019 Cancer. The latitude, from the table, was 3\u00b0 33\u2019 north.\nOn the same night, the one following December 10, at 12\u2159h, Fabricius in East Frisia found Mars\u2019s position to be 3\u00b0 40\u00bc\u2019 Cancer with latitude 3\u00b0 23\u2019 N. In this observation the longitude comes out nearly the same. For the motion over 3h 40m is 3\u00bd\u2019, so that in the Brahean observation too, at 12\u2159h Mars could have been at 3\u00b0 42\u2019 Cancer\u2014two minutes beyond the Fabrician position.\nX. On 1600 January 13\/23 at 11h 40m, the time being adjusted to Uraniborg time, the planet was observed at 10\u00b0 38\u2019 46\u201c Leo ^21. The sun\u2019s position was 3\u00b0 26\u2019 30\u201c Aquarius. The stars were 7\u00b0 12\u2019 16\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion for the next few days was 1\u00b0 1\u2019 3\u201c; that of Mars, 23\u2019 44\u201c. The sum: 1\u00b0 24\u2019 47\u201c. The opposition therefore followed 5 days 2h 22m after; that is, on January 19\/29 at 2h 2m in the morning, before dawn. Mars was at 8\u00b0 38\u2019 Leo. There is no need for reduction, since it is near the limit. The latitude, from the table, was 4\u00b0 30\u2019 50\u201c N.\nXI. On the evening of 1602 Febr. 18\/28 at 10h 30m, using the Tychonic  instruments (with the help of the learned Matthias Seiffard,22 bequeathed us by Tycho), I took the distance of Mars from the middle star of the tail of Ursa Major 23 to be 52\u00b0 22\u2019. And since the distance between Cor Leonis and Procyon was 37\u00b0 22\u2019 20\u201c, which should have been 37\u00b0 19\u2019 50\u201c,24 we know that the sextant reads 2\u00bd minutes high. Therefore, the corrected distance of Mars from the tail of Ursa was 52\u00b0 19\u00bd\u2019. And since the latitude of the fixed star is 56\u00b0 22\u2019, the remainder, by subtraction, is 4\u00b0 2\u00bd\u2019\u2014supposing that Mars was at precisely the same longitude as the fixed star. But because there was a difference of 3\u00be degrees between them (as is clear from the following observations), a slight correction is required.\n For let AB be 3\u00b0 43\u2019 30\u201c on a parallel close to the ecliptic, B Mars, C the fixed star, and BC 52\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c. Dividing the secant of BC by the secant of AB gives the  secant of CA, 52\u00b0 14\u2019, which, subtracted from 56\u00b0 22\u2019 (the latitude of the fixed star) leaves 4\u00b0 8\u2019 north as Mars\u2019s observed latitude. At the same time, we found 19\u00b0 23\u2019 between Mars and Cor Leonis (19\u00b0 20\u00bd corrected), and 21\u00b0 20\u2019 between Mars and the bright star in the wing of Virgo25 (21\u00b0 17\u00bd\u2019 corrected). From these two distances (using the latitudes of the stars and Mars), Mars\u2019s longitude is found to be 13\u00b0 19\u2019 6\u201c Virgo, by consensus of all measurements.\nAlternatively, the meridian altitude of Mars was found at 12h 40m, using two quadrants, to be 50\u00b0 19\u2019, while the tail of Leo26 was 56\u00b0 45\u2019. Therefore, from the declinations and right ascensions of the fixed stars and our distances, Mars\u2019s position is determined as 13\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c Virgo, latitude 4\u00b0 7\u2019 55\u201c ^27. This is the Tychonic procedure. I have included the other for the sake of showing a consensus, and also that it might be evident that despite the lack of absolute perfection in the demonstration, short cuts either in computation or in our understanding can under certain circumstances be applied. For in that previous procedure there is less in the actual work than in the reporting of it. At Prague, 5\u00b0 Scorpio was rising ^28. Therefore, the nonagesimal was about 32\u00bd\u00b0 from the zenith. And since Mars\u2019s distance from the earth was rather more than half the sun\u2019s distance, the resulting parallax of about 5\u2019 opposite 32\u00bd\u00b0 in our parallactic table, shows a latitudinal parallax of 2\u2019 41\u201c. Thus the latitude as seen from the middle of the earth would be 4\u00b0 10\u2154\u2019 north. And because the altitude of the nonagesimal was 57\u00bd\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax at the horizon was 4\u2019 13\u201c. But since Mars was 38\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, the longitudinal parallax corresponding to this position is 2\u2019 36\u201c, and if this be eliminated, Mars would be placed at about 13\u00b0 18\u2019 Virgo ^29. At that moment, the sun\u2019s position was 10\u00b0 16\u2019 42\u201c Pisces. The distance between the bodies was 3\u00b0 1\u2019 18\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 4\u201c, and that of Mars, 24\u2019 5\u201c (for it was 24\u2019 18\u201c at 21\u00b0 Leo in 1585, and 24\u2019 at 26 Virgo in 1587). The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 24\u2019 9\u201c. The true opposition therefore followed 2 days 3 hours 43 minutes later, on 21 February\/3 March before dawn at 2h 13m, Mars being at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 35\u201c Virgo. Forty seconds must be subtracted to reduce the position to the orbit, putting Mars at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 Virgo, with slightly less latitude than before, since the latitude was then decreasing. It was therefore about 4\u00b0 10\u2019, or 4\u00b0 7\u2153\u2019 if the parallax be neglected.\n But because, since Tycho\u2019s death, we have not made frequent observations nor continued them over several days, it would be best, for certainty\u2019s sake, also to make use of those observations which David Fabricius of East Frisia, a sedulous practitioner of astronomy, has communicated to me.\nOn February 16, old style, at 5h in the morning, he took the planet\u2019s distances from the tail of Leo (for the latitude), from the neck of Leo,30 and, on the other hand, from the bright star in the southern wing of Virgo, so as to check its longitude by working it out twice.\nI could make use of Tycho\u2019s line of reasoning, which he routinely adopted in volume I of the Progymnasmata when (as here) the declination of the planet was not known. But because that method extends to ten operations, I prefer for the sake of brevity to proceed as I did before with my own observations. Here there are no hidden dangers.\nFirst, the star in the wing of Virgo, adjusted to our time, is at 4\u00b0 36\u2019 30\u201c Libra with latitude 2\u00b0 50\u2019 north. Fabricius found that Mars is 20\u00b0 18\u2019 westward from it on the zodiac, which puts Mars at about 14\u00b0 18\u2019 30\u201c Virgo. This is a preliminary, approximate figure: the longitude will shortly be corrected. Now the tail of Leo31 is at 16\u00b0 4\u2019 Virgo, with latitude 12\u00b0 18\u2019 North, and Mars was found to be 8\u00b0 17\u2019 distant from the Tail. What is sought is the distance of its parallel from the Tail, since the difference in longitude is 1\u00b0 45\u2019. Dividing the secant of 8\u00b0 17\u2019 by the secant of 1\u00b0 45\u2019 gives the secant of 8\u00b0 6\u2019, the arc sought. This subtracted from the fixed star\u2019s northern latitude of 12\u00b0 18\u2019 leaves Mars\u2019s latitude, 4\u00b0 12\u2019 north. This I now take as determined, and compare it with the latitudes of the fixed stars according to the laws of trigonometry. From the Wing of Virgo, I find Mars\u2019s longitude to be 14\u00b0 19\u2019 Virgo; from the Neck of Leo, 14\u00b0 23\u2019 36\u201c. The mean of these two is 14\u00b0 21\u2019 18\u201c Virgo. And since the sextant gave distances larger than the truth, the latitude would come out at 4\u00b0 14\u2019 north.\nOn the night following February 23, at 12h, he observed Mars in relation to five fixed stars: the Tail of Leo and Arcturus for latitude, and for the longitude, in the first instance, Spica (which followed it), and, in the second, the Neck of Leo and Cor Leonis (which preceded it).\nBy a rough estimate, I foresee that Mars is going to fall at 11\u00bc\u00b0 Virgo. It was found to be 9\u00b0 24\u2019 from the Tail of Leo, and hence, its latitude comes out at 4\u00b0 6\u2019 ^32. And now, through this and the latitudes of the fixed stars, together with their distances (17\u00b0 26\u2019 from Regulus, 17\u00b0 51\u2019 from the Neck of Leo, 37\u00b0 28\u2019 from Spica, 44\u00b0 15\u2019 from Arcturus), Mars\u2019s position comes out at 11\u00b0 21\u2019 23\u201c Virgo (from Regulus), 11\u00b0 20\u2019 52\u201c Virgo (from the Neck of Leo), and 11\u00b0 17\u2019 40\u201c (from Spica). Again (as you see) the distances err in being too great. For from the Heart and the Neck [of Leo], Mars is pushed a little eastward, and from Spica and Arcturus a little westward, and more from Arcturus, owing to its greater northern latitude ^33. The mean (ignoring Arcturus), 11\u00b0 19\u2019 20\u201c Virgo, is very nearly true. Also, the latitude is greater, namely, 4\u00b0 7\u2019 40\u201c north. Now from February 15 at 17h to 23 February at 12h, a period of 7 days 19 hours, Mars moved 3\u00b0 0\u2019: 180 minutes in 187 hours. That is, about one minute per hour. And if you wish to take it into account, the parallax (if any) is subtracted from the longitude on February 16 and a little is added on February 23.\n Because the last observation follows the time of observation found by me by 2 days 21 hours 47 min., add the motion corresponding to this time, 1\u00b0 7\u2019: the position will come out 12\u00b0 26\u2019 Virgo. The agreement is thus very good\u2014it could not be better\u2014given that both of us [that is, Kepler and Fabricius] work independently and do not rely on the facilities used by Tycho Brahe.","1742":"VIII. On 1595 October 30 at 8h 20m, the planet was found at 17\u00b0 47\u2019 15\u201c Taurus,19 not far from the nonagesimal. We may thus be sure of the parallax, although we must take it into account. The latitude was 0\u00b0 5\u2019 10\u201c north. The sun\u2019s position was 16\u00b0 50\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio. The distance between the stars was 56\u2019 45\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 35\u201c; that of Mars, 22\u2019 54\u201c, as appears by comparing the nearby observations. The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 23\u2019 29\u201c. If the distance between the stars be divided by this, it comes out to 40\u2019 47\u201c of a day, or 16 hours 19 min. Therefore, the true opposition was 0h 39m PM on October 31. Mars\u2019s position was 17\u00b0 31\u2019 40\u201c Taurus. This needs no reduction to the orbit, as it is nearly at the node. The latitude was about 0\u00b0 8\u2019 north. But comparison with the preceding and following days shows a latitude of about 5\u2019 north.\nIX. Let, at any rate, Mars\u2019s position on 1597 December 10 at 8h 30m be 3\u00b0 45\u00bd\u2019 Cancer (as above) ^20. The sun\u2019s position was 29\u00b0 4\u2019 53\u201c Sagittarius. The distance between the stars was 4\u00b0 40\u2019 37\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 61\u2019 20\u201c, that of Mars 23\u2019 40\u201c (for in 1580 the diurnal motion in Gemini was 23\u2019, and in 1582, at 17\u00b0 Cancer, it was 24\u2019). Therefore, the sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 25\u2019 0\u201c. These data show that the time of true opposition followed 3 days 7 hours 14 min. later, on December 14 at 3h 44m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 2\u00b0 27\u2153\u2019 Cancer. The reduction to the orbit (quite ridiculous here, since the observation itself has an uncertainty of several minutes) requires the addition of about 52\u201c. Therefore, the corrected position was 2\u00b0 28\u2019 Cancer. The latitude, from the table, was 3\u00b0 33\u2019 north.\nOn the same night, the one following December 10, at 12\u2159h, Fabricius in East Frisia found Mars\u2019s position to be 3\u00b0 40\u00bc\u2019 Cancer with latitude 3\u00b0 23\u2019 N. In this observation the longitude comes out nearly the same. For the motion over 3h 40m is 3\u00bd\u2019, so that in the Brahean observation too, at 12\u2159h Mars could have been at 3\u00b0 42\u2019 Cancer\u2014two minutes beyond the Fabrician position.\nX. On 1600 January 13\/23 at 11h 40m, the time being adjusted to Uraniborg time, the planet was observed at 10\u00b0 38\u2019 46\u201c Leo ^21. The sun\u2019s position was 3\u00b0 26\u2019 30\u201c Aquarius. The stars were 7\u00b0 12\u2019 16\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion for the next few days was 1\u00b0 1\u2019 3\u201c; that of Mars, 23\u2019 44\u201c. The sum: 1\u00b0 24\u2019 47\u201c. The opposition therefore followed 5 days 2h 22m after; that is, on January 19\/29 at 2h 2m in the morning, before dawn. Mars was at 8\u00b0 38\u2019 Leo. There is no need for reduction, since it is near the limit. The latitude, from the table, was 4\u00b0 30\u2019 50\u201c N.\nXI. On the evening of 1602 Febr. 18\/28 at 10h 30m, using the Tychonic  instruments (with the help of the learned Matthias Seiffard,22 bequeathed us by Tycho), I took the distance of Mars from the middle star of the tail of Ursa Major 23 to be 52\u00b0 22\u2019. And since the distance between Cor Leonis and Procyon was 37\u00b0 22\u2019 20\u201c, which should have been 37\u00b0 19\u2019 50\u201c,24 we know that the sextant reads 2\u00bd minutes high. Therefore, the corrected distance of Mars from the tail of Ursa was 52\u00b0 19\u00bd\u2019. And since the latitude of the fixed star is 56\u00b0 22\u2019, the remainder, by subtraction, is 4\u00b0 2\u00bd\u2019\u2014supposing that Mars was at precisely the same longitude as the fixed star. But because there was a difference of 3\u00be degrees between them (as is clear from the following observations), a slight correction is required.\n For let AB be 3\u00b0 43\u2019 30\u201c on a parallel close to the ecliptic, B Mars, C the fixed star, and BC 52\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c. Dividing the secant of BC by the secant of AB gives the  secant of CA, 52\u00b0 14\u2019, which, subtracted from 56\u00b0 22\u2019 (the latitude of the fixed star) leaves 4\u00b0 8\u2019 north as Mars\u2019s observed latitude. At the same time, we found 19\u00b0 23\u2019 between Mars and Cor Leonis (19\u00b0 20\u00bd corrected), and 21\u00b0 20\u2019 between Mars and the bright star in the wing of Virgo25 (21\u00b0 17\u00bd\u2019 corrected). From these two distances (using the latitudes of the stars and Mars), Mars\u2019s longitude is found to be 13\u00b0 19\u2019 6\u201c Virgo, by consensus of all measurements.\nAlternatively, the meridian altitude of Mars was found at 12h 40m, using two quadrants, to be 50\u00b0 19\u2019, while the tail of Leo26 was 56\u00b0 45\u2019. Therefore, from the declinations and right ascensions of the fixed stars and our distances, Mars\u2019s position is determined as 13\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c Virgo, latitude 4\u00b0 7\u2019 55\u201c ^27. This is the Tychonic procedure. I have included the other for the sake of showing a consensus, and also that it might be evident that despite the lack of absolute perfection in the demonstration, short cuts either in computation or in our understanding can under certain circumstances be applied. For in that previous procedure there is less in the actual work than in the reporting of it. At Prague, 5\u00b0 Scorpio was rising ^28. Therefore, the nonagesimal was about 32\u00bd\u00b0 from the zenith. And since Mars\u2019s distance from the earth was rather more than half the sun\u2019s distance, the resulting parallax of about 5\u2019 opposite 32\u00bd\u00b0 in our parallactic table, shows a latitudinal parallax of 2\u2019 41\u201c. Thus the latitude as seen from the middle of the earth would be 4\u00b0 10\u2154\u2019 north. And because the altitude of the nonagesimal was 57\u00bd\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax at the horizon was 4\u2019 13\u201c. But since Mars was 38\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, the longitudinal parallax corresponding to this position is 2\u2019 36\u201c, and if this be eliminated, Mars would be placed at about 13\u00b0 18\u2019 Virgo ^29. At that moment, the sun\u2019s position was 10\u00b0 16\u2019 42\u201c Pisces. The distance between the bodies was 3\u00b0 1\u2019 18\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 4\u201c, and that of Mars, 24\u2019 5\u201c (for it was 24\u2019 18\u201c at 21\u00b0 Leo in 1585, and 24\u2019 at 26 Virgo in 1587). The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 24\u2019 9\u201c. The true opposition therefore followed 2 days 3 hours 43 minutes later, on 21 February\/3 March before dawn at 2h 13m, Mars being at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 35\u201c Virgo. Forty seconds must be subtracted to reduce the position to the orbit, putting Mars at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 Virgo, with slightly less latitude than before, since the latitude was then decreasing. It was therefore about 4\u00b0 10\u2019, or 4\u00b0 7\u2153\u2019 if the parallax be neglected.\n But because, since Tycho\u2019s death, we have not made frequent observations nor continued them over several days, it would be best, for certainty\u2019s sake, also to make use of those observations which David Fabricius of East Frisia, a sedulous practitioner of astronomy, has communicated to me.\nOn February 16, old style, at 5h in the morning, he took the planet\u2019s distances from the tail of Leo (for the latitude), from the neck of Leo,30 and, on the other hand, from the bright star in the southern wing of Virgo, so as to check its longitude by working it out twice.\nI could make use of Tycho\u2019s line of reasoning, which he routinely adopted in volume I of the Progymnasmata when (as here) the declination of the planet was not known. But because that method extends to ten operations, I prefer for the sake of brevity to proceed as I did before with my own observations. Here there are no hidden dangers.\nFirst, the star in the wing of Virgo, adjusted to our time, is at 4\u00b0 36\u2019 30\u201c Libra with latitude 2\u00b0 50\u2019 north. Fabricius found that Mars is 20\u00b0 18\u2019 westward from it on the zodiac, which puts Mars at about 14\u00b0 18\u2019 30\u201c Virgo. This is a preliminary, approximate figure: the longitude will shortly be corrected. Now the tail of Leo31 is at 16\u00b0 4\u2019 Virgo, with latitude 12\u00b0 18\u2019 North, and Mars was found to be 8\u00b0 17\u2019 distant from the Tail. What is sought is the distance of its parallel from the Tail, since the difference in longitude is 1\u00b0 45\u2019. Dividing the secant of 8\u00b0 17\u2019 by the secant of 1\u00b0 45\u2019 gives the secant of 8\u00b0 6\u2019, the arc sought. This subtracted from the fixed star\u2019s northern latitude of 12\u00b0 18\u2019 leaves Mars\u2019s latitude, 4\u00b0 12\u2019 north. This I now take as determined, and compare it with the latitudes of the fixed stars according to the laws of trigonometry. From the Wing of Virgo, I find Mars\u2019s longitude to be 14\u00b0 19\u2019 Virgo; from the Neck of Leo, 14\u00b0 23\u2019 36\u201c. The mean of these two is 14\u00b0 21\u2019 18\u201c Virgo. And since the sextant gave distances larger than the truth, the latitude would come out at 4\u00b0 14\u2019 north.\nOn the night following February 23, at 12h, he observed Mars in relation to five fixed stars: the Tail of Leo and Arcturus for latitude, and for the longitude, in the first instance, Spica (which followed it), and, in the second, the Neck of Leo and Cor Leonis (which preceded it).\nBy a rough estimate, I foresee that Mars is going to fall at 11\u00bc\u00b0 Virgo. It was found to be 9\u00b0 24\u2019 from the Tail of Leo, and hence, its latitude comes out at 4\u00b0 6\u2019 ^32. And now, through this and the latitudes of the fixed stars, together with their distances (17\u00b0 26\u2019 from Regulus, 17\u00b0 51\u2019 from the Neck of Leo, 37\u00b0 28\u2019 from Spica, 44\u00b0 15\u2019 from Arcturus), Mars\u2019s position comes out at 11\u00b0 21\u2019 23\u201c Virgo (from Regulus), 11\u00b0 20\u2019 52\u201c Virgo (from the Neck of Leo), and 11\u00b0 17\u2019 40\u201c (from Spica). Again (as you see) the distances err in being too great. For from the Heart and the Neck [of Leo], Mars is pushed a little eastward, and from Spica and Arcturus a little westward, and more from Arcturus, owing to its greater northern latitude ^33. The mean (ignoring Arcturus), 11\u00b0 19\u2019 20\u201c Virgo, is very nearly true. Also, the latitude is greater, namely, 4\u00b0 7\u2019 40\u201c north. Now from February 15 at 17h to 23 February at 12h, a period of 7 days 19 hours, Mars moved 3\u00b0 0\u2019: 180 minutes in 187 hours. That is, about one minute per hour. And if you wish to take it into account, the parallax (if any) is subtracted from the longitude on February 16 and a little is added on February 23.\n Because the last observation follows the time of observation found by me by 2 days 21 hours 47 min., add the motion corresponding to this time, 1\u00b0 7\u2019: the position will come out 12\u00b0 26\u2019 Virgo. The agreement is thus very good\u2014it could not be better\u2014given that both of us [that is, Kepler and Fabricius] work independently and do not rely on the facilities used by Tycho Brahe.","1743":"VIII. On 1595 October 30 at 8h 20m, the planet was found at 17\u00b0 47\u2019 15\u201c Taurus,19 not far from the nonagesimal. We may thus be sure of the parallax, although we must take it into account. The latitude was 0\u00b0 5\u2019 10\u201c north. The sun\u2019s position was 16\u00b0 50\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio. The distance between the stars was 56\u2019 45\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 35\u201c; that of Mars, 22\u2019 54\u201c, as appears by comparing the nearby observations. The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 23\u2019 29\u201c. If the distance between the stars be divided by this, it comes out to 40\u2019 47\u201c of a day, or 16 hours 19 min. Therefore, the true opposition was 0h 39m PM on October 31. Mars\u2019s position was 17\u00b0 31\u2019 40\u201c Taurus. This needs no reduction to the orbit, as it is nearly at the node. The latitude was about 0\u00b0 8\u2019 north. But comparison with the preceding and following days shows a latitude of about 5\u2019 north.\nIX. Let, at any rate, Mars\u2019s position on 1597 December 10 at 8h 30m be 3\u00b0 45\u00bd\u2019 Cancer (as above) ^20. The sun\u2019s position was 29\u00b0 4\u2019 53\u201c Sagittarius. The distance between the stars was 4\u00b0 40\u2019 37\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 61\u2019 20\u201c, that of Mars 23\u2019 40\u201c (for in 1580 the diurnal motion in Gemini was 23\u2019, and in 1582, at 17\u00b0 Cancer, it was 24\u2019). Therefore, the sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 25\u2019 0\u201c. These data show that the time of true opposition followed 3 days 7 hours 14 min. later, on December 14 at 3h 44m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 2\u00b0 27\u2153\u2019 Cancer. The reduction to the orbit (quite ridiculous here, since the observation itself has an uncertainty of several minutes) requires the addition of about 52\u201c. Therefore, the corrected position was 2\u00b0 28\u2019 Cancer. The latitude, from the table, was 3\u00b0 33\u2019 north.\nOn the same night, the one following December 10, at 12\u2159h, Fabricius in East Frisia found Mars\u2019s position to be 3\u00b0 40\u00bc\u2019 Cancer with latitude 3\u00b0 23\u2019 N. In this observation the longitude comes out nearly the same. For the motion over 3h 40m is 3\u00bd\u2019, so that in the Brahean observation too, at 12\u2159h Mars could have been at 3\u00b0 42\u2019 Cancer\u2014two minutes beyond the Fabrician position.\nX. On 1600 January 13\/23 at 11h 40m, the time being adjusted to Uraniborg time, the planet was observed at 10\u00b0 38\u2019 46\u201c Leo ^21. The sun\u2019s position was 3\u00b0 26\u2019 30\u201c Aquarius. The stars were 7\u00b0 12\u2019 16\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion for the next few days was 1\u00b0 1\u2019 3\u201c; that of Mars, 23\u2019 44\u201c. The sum: 1\u00b0 24\u2019 47\u201c. The opposition therefore followed 5 days 2h 22m after; that is, on January 19\/29 at 2h 2m in the morning, before dawn. Mars was at 8\u00b0 38\u2019 Leo. There is no need for reduction, since it is near the limit. The latitude, from the table, was 4\u00b0 30\u2019 50\u201c N.\nXI. On the evening of 1602 Febr. 18\/28 at 10h 30m, using the Tychonic  instruments (with the help of the learned Matthias Seiffard,22 bequeathed us by Tycho), I took the distance of Mars from the middle star of the tail of Ursa Major 23 to be 52\u00b0 22\u2019. And since the distance between Cor Leonis and Procyon was 37\u00b0 22\u2019 20\u201c, which should have been 37\u00b0 19\u2019 50\u201c,24 we know that the sextant reads 2\u00bd minutes high. Therefore, the corrected distance of Mars from the tail of Ursa was 52\u00b0 19\u00bd\u2019. And since the latitude of the fixed star is 56\u00b0 22\u2019, the remainder, by subtraction, is 4\u00b0 2\u00bd\u2019\u2014supposing that Mars was at precisely the same longitude as the fixed star. But because there was a difference of 3\u00be degrees between them (as is clear from the following observations), a slight correction is required.\n For let AB be 3\u00b0 43\u2019 30\u201c on a parallel close to the ecliptic, B Mars, C the fixed star, and BC 52\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c. Dividing the secant of BC by the secant of AB gives the  secant of CA, 52\u00b0 14\u2019, which, subtracted from 56\u00b0 22\u2019 (the latitude of the fixed star) leaves 4\u00b0 8\u2019 north as Mars\u2019s observed latitude. At the same time, we found 19\u00b0 23\u2019 between Mars and Cor Leonis (19\u00b0 20\u00bd corrected), and 21\u00b0 20\u2019 between Mars and the bright star in the wing of Virgo25 (21\u00b0 17\u00bd\u2019 corrected). From these two distances (using the latitudes of the stars and Mars), Mars\u2019s longitude is found to be 13\u00b0 19\u2019 6\u201c Virgo, by consensus of all measurements.\nAlternatively, the meridian altitude of Mars was found at 12h 40m, using two quadrants, to be 50\u00b0 19\u2019, while the tail of Leo26 was 56\u00b0 45\u2019. Therefore, from the declinations and right ascensions of the fixed stars and our distances, Mars\u2019s position is determined as 13\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c Virgo, latitude 4\u00b0 7\u2019 55\u201c ^27. This is the Tychonic procedure. I have included the other for the sake of showing a consensus, and also that it might be evident that despite the lack of absolute perfection in the demonstration, short cuts either in computation or in our understanding can under certain circumstances be applied. For in that previous procedure there is less in the actual work than in the reporting of it. At Prague, 5\u00b0 Scorpio was rising ^28. Therefore, the nonagesimal was about 32\u00bd\u00b0 from the zenith. And since Mars\u2019s distance from the earth was rather more than half the sun\u2019s distance, the resulting parallax of about 5\u2019 opposite 32\u00bd\u00b0 in our parallactic table, shows a latitudinal parallax of 2\u2019 41\u201c. Thus the latitude as seen from the middle of the earth would be 4\u00b0 10\u2154\u2019 north. And because the altitude of the nonagesimal was 57\u00bd\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax at the horizon was 4\u2019 13\u201c. But since Mars was 38\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, the longitudinal parallax corresponding to this position is 2\u2019 36\u201c, and if this be eliminated, Mars would be placed at about 13\u00b0 18\u2019 Virgo ^29. At that moment, the sun\u2019s position was 10\u00b0 16\u2019 42\u201c Pisces. The distance between the bodies was 3\u00b0 1\u2019 18\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 4\u201c, and that of Mars, 24\u2019 5\u201c (for it was 24\u2019 18\u201c at 21\u00b0 Leo in 1585, and 24\u2019 at 26 Virgo in 1587). The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 24\u2019 9\u201c. The true opposition therefore followed 2 days 3 hours 43 minutes later, on 21 February\/3 March before dawn at 2h 13m, Mars being at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 35\u201c Virgo. Forty seconds must be subtracted to reduce the position to the orbit, putting Mars at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 Virgo, with slightly less latitude than before, since the latitude was then decreasing. It was therefore about 4\u00b0 10\u2019, or 4\u00b0 7\u2153\u2019 if the parallax be neglected.\n But because, since Tycho\u2019s death, we have not made frequent observations nor continued them over several days, it would be best, for certainty\u2019s sake, also to make use of those observations which David Fabricius of East Frisia, a sedulous practitioner of astronomy, has communicated to me.\nOn February 16, old style, at 5h in the morning, he took the planet\u2019s distances from the tail of Leo (for the latitude), from the neck of Leo,30 and, on the other hand, from the bright star in the southern wing of Virgo, so as to check its longitude by working it out twice.\nI could make use of Tycho\u2019s line of reasoning, which he routinely adopted in volume I of the Progymnasmata when (as here) the declination of the planet was not known. But because that method extends to ten operations, I prefer for the sake of brevity to proceed as I did before with my own observations. Here there are no hidden dangers.\nFirst, the star in the wing of Virgo, adjusted to our time, is at 4\u00b0 36\u2019 30\u201c Libra with latitude 2\u00b0 50\u2019 north. Fabricius found that Mars is 20\u00b0 18\u2019 westward from it on the zodiac, which puts Mars at about 14\u00b0 18\u2019 30\u201c Virgo. This is a preliminary, approximate figure: the longitude will shortly be corrected. Now the tail of Leo31 is at 16\u00b0 4\u2019 Virgo, with latitude 12\u00b0 18\u2019 North, and Mars was found to be 8\u00b0 17\u2019 distant from the Tail. What is sought is the distance of its parallel from the Tail, since the difference in longitude is 1\u00b0 45\u2019. Dividing the secant of 8\u00b0 17\u2019 by the secant of 1\u00b0 45\u2019 gives the secant of 8\u00b0 6\u2019, the arc sought. This subtracted from the fixed star\u2019s northern latitude of 12\u00b0 18\u2019 leaves Mars\u2019s latitude, 4\u00b0 12\u2019 north. This I now take as determined, and compare it with the latitudes of the fixed stars according to the laws of trigonometry. From the Wing of Virgo, I find Mars\u2019s longitude to be 14\u00b0 19\u2019 Virgo; from the Neck of Leo, 14\u00b0 23\u2019 36\u201c. The mean of these two is 14\u00b0 21\u2019 18\u201c Virgo. And since the sextant gave distances larger than the truth, the latitude would come out at 4\u00b0 14\u2019 north.\nOn the night following February 23, at 12h, he observed Mars in relation to five fixed stars: the Tail of Leo and Arcturus for latitude, and for the longitude, in the first instance, Spica (which followed it), and, in the second, the Neck of Leo and Cor Leonis (which preceded it).\nBy a rough estimate, I foresee that Mars is going to fall at 11\u00bc\u00b0 Virgo. It was found to be 9\u00b0 24\u2019 from the Tail of Leo, and hence, its latitude comes out at 4\u00b0 6\u2019 ^32. And now, through this and the latitudes of the fixed stars, together with their distances (17\u00b0 26\u2019 from Regulus, 17\u00b0 51\u2019 from the Neck of Leo, 37\u00b0 28\u2019 from Spica, 44\u00b0 15\u2019 from Arcturus), Mars\u2019s position comes out at 11\u00b0 21\u2019 23\u201c Virgo (from Regulus), 11\u00b0 20\u2019 52\u201c Virgo (from the Neck of Leo), and 11\u00b0 17\u2019 40\u201c (from Spica). Again (as you see) the distances err in being too great. For from the Heart and the Neck [of Leo], Mars is pushed a little eastward, and from Spica and Arcturus a little westward, and more from Arcturus, owing to its greater northern latitude ^33. The mean (ignoring Arcturus), 11\u00b0 19\u2019 20\u201c Virgo, is very nearly true. Also, the latitude is greater, namely, 4\u00b0 7\u2019 40\u201c north. Now from February 15 at 17h to 23 February at 12h, a period of 7 days 19 hours, Mars moved 3\u00b0 0\u2019: 180 minutes in 187 hours. That is, about one minute per hour. And if you wish to take it into account, the parallax (if any) is subtracted from the longitude on February 16 and a little is added on February 23.\n Because the last observation follows the time of observation found by me by 2 days 21 hours 47 min., add the motion corresponding to this time, 1\u00b0 7\u2019: the position will come out 12\u00b0 26\u2019 Virgo. The agreement is thus very good\u2014it could not be better\u2014given that both of us [that is, Kepler and Fabricius] work independently and do not rely on the facilities used by Tycho Brahe.","1744":"VIII. On 1595 October 30 at 8h 20m, the planet was found at 17\u00b0 47\u2019 15\u201c Taurus,19 not far from the nonagesimal. We may thus be sure of the parallax, although we must take it into account. The latitude was 0\u00b0 5\u2019 10\u201c north. The sun\u2019s position was 16\u00b0 50\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio. The distance between the stars was 56\u2019 45\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 35\u201c; that of Mars, 22\u2019 54\u201c, as appears by comparing the nearby observations. The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 23\u2019 29\u201c. If the distance between the stars be divided by this, it comes out to 40\u2019 47\u201c of a day, or 16 hours 19 min. Therefore, the true opposition was 0h 39m PM on October 31. Mars\u2019s position was 17\u00b0 31\u2019 40\u201c Taurus. This needs no reduction to the orbit, as it is nearly at the node. The latitude was about 0\u00b0 8\u2019 north. But comparison with the preceding and following days shows a latitude of about 5\u2019 north.\nIX. Let, at any rate, Mars\u2019s position on 1597 December 10 at 8h 30m be 3\u00b0 45\u00bd\u2019 Cancer (as above) ^20. The sun\u2019s position was 29\u00b0 4\u2019 53\u201c Sagittarius. The distance between the stars was 4\u00b0 40\u2019 37\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 61\u2019 20\u201c, that of Mars 23\u2019 40\u201c (for in 1580 the diurnal motion in Gemini was 23\u2019, and in 1582, at 17\u00b0 Cancer, it was 24\u2019). Therefore, the sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 25\u2019 0\u201c. These data show that the time of true opposition followed 3 days 7 hours 14 min. later, on December 14 at 3h 44m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 2\u00b0 27\u2153\u2019 Cancer. The reduction to the orbit (quite ridiculous here, since the observation itself has an uncertainty of several minutes) requires the addition of about 52\u201c. Therefore, the corrected position was 2\u00b0 28\u2019 Cancer. The latitude, from the table, was 3\u00b0 33\u2019 north.\nOn the same night, the one following December 10, at 12\u2159h, Fabricius in East Frisia found Mars\u2019s position to be 3\u00b0 40\u00bc\u2019 Cancer with latitude 3\u00b0 23\u2019 N. In this observation the longitude comes out nearly the same. For the motion over 3h 40m is 3\u00bd\u2019, so that in the Brahean observation too, at 12\u2159h Mars could have been at 3\u00b0 42\u2019 Cancer\u2014two minutes beyond the Fabrician position.\nX. On 1600 January 13\/23 at 11h 40m, the time being adjusted to Uraniborg time, the planet was observed at 10\u00b0 38\u2019 46\u201c Leo ^21. The sun\u2019s position was 3\u00b0 26\u2019 30\u201c Aquarius. The stars were 7\u00b0 12\u2019 16\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion for the next few days was 1\u00b0 1\u2019 3\u201c; that of Mars, 23\u2019 44\u201c. The sum: 1\u00b0 24\u2019 47\u201c. The opposition therefore followed 5 days 2h 22m after; that is, on January 19\/29 at 2h 2m in the morning, before dawn. Mars was at 8\u00b0 38\u2019 Leo. There is no need for reduction, since it is near the limit. The latitude, from the table, was 4\u00b0 30\u2019 50\u201c N.\nXI. On the evening of 1602 Febr. 18\/28 at 10h 30m, using the Tychonic  instruments (with the help of the learned Matthias Seiffard,22 bequeathed us by Tycho), I took the distance of Mars from the middle star of the tail of Ursa Major 23 to be 52\u00b0 22\u2019. And since the distance between Cor Leonis and Procyon was 37\u00b0 22\u2019 20\u201c, which should have been 37\u00b0 19\u2019 50\u201c,24 we know that the sextant reads 2\u00bd minutes high. Therefore, the corrected distance of Mars from the tail of Ursa was 52\u00b0 19\u00bd\u2019. And since the latitude of the fixed star is 56\u00b0 22\u2019, the remainder, by subtraction, is 4\u00b0 2\u00bd\u2019\u2014supposing that Mars was at precisely the same longitude as the fixed star. But because there was a difference of 3\u00be degrees between them (as is clear from the following observations), a slight correction is required.\n For let AB be 3\u00b0 43\u2019 30\u201c on a parallel close to the ecliptic, B Mars, C the fixed star, and BC 52\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c. Dividing the secant of BC by the secant of AB gives the  secant of CA, 52\u00b0 14\u2019, which, subtracted from 56\u00b0 22\u2019 (the latitude of the fixed star) leaves 4\u00b0 8\u2019 north as Mars\u2019s observed latitude. At the same time, we found 19\u00b0 23\u2019 between Mars and Cor Leonis (19\u00b0 20\u00bd corrected), and 21\u00b0 20\u2019 between Mars and the bright star in the wing of Virgo25 (21\u00b0 17\u00bd\u2019 corrected). From these two distances (using the latitudes of the stars and Mars), Mars\u2019s longitude is found to be 13\u00b0 19\u2019 6\u201c Virgo, by consensus of all measurements.\nAlternatively, the meridian altitude of Mars was found at 12h 40m, using two quadrants, to be 50\u00b0 19\u2019, while the tail of Leo26 was 56\u00b0 45\u2019. Therefore, from the declinations and right ascensions of the fixed stars and our distances, Mars\u2019s position is determined as 13\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c Virgo, latitude 4\u00b0 7\u2019 55\u201c ^27. This is the Tychonic procedure. I have included the other for the sake of showing a consensus, and also that it might be evident that despite the lack of absolute perfection in the demonstration, short cuts either in computation or in our understanding can under certain circumstances be applied. For in that previous procedure there is less in the actual work than in the reporting of it. At Prague, 5\u00b0 Scorpio was rising ^28. Therefore, the nonagesimal was about 32\u00bd\u00b0 from the zenith. And since Mars\u2019s distance from the earth was rather more than half the sun\u2019s distance, the resulting parallax of about 5\u2019 opposite 32\u00bd\u00b0 in our parallactic table, shows a latitudinal parallax of 2\u2019 41\u201c. Thus the latitude as seen from the middle of the earth would be 4\u00b0 10\u2154\u2019 north. And because the altitude of the nonagesimal was 57\u00bd\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax at the horizon was 4\u2019 13\u201c. But since Mars was 38\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, the longitudinal parallax corresponding to this position is 2\u2019 36\u201c, and if this be eliminated, Mars would be placed at about 13\u00b0 18\u2019 Virgo ^29. At that moment, the sun\u2019s position was 10\u00b0 16\u2019 42\u201c Pisces. The distance between the bodies was 3\u00b0 1\u2019 18\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 4\u201c, and that of Mars, 24\u2019 5\u201c (for it was 24\u2019 18\u201c at 21\u00b0 Leo in 1585, and 24\u2019 at 26 Virgo in 1587). The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 24\u2019 9\u201c. The true opposition therefore followed 2 days 3 hours 43 minutes later, on 21 February\/3 March before dawn at 2h 13m, Mars being at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 35\u201c Virgo. Forty seconds must be subtracted to reduce the position to the orbit, putting Mars at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 Virgo, with slightly less latitude than before, since the latitude was then decreasing. It was therefore about 4\u00b0 10\u2019, or 4\u00b0 7\u2153\u2019 if the parallax be neglected.\n But because, since Tycho\u2019s death, we have not made frequent observations nor continued them over several days, it would be best, for certainty\u2019s sake, also to make use of those observations which David Fabricius of East Frisia, a sedulous practitioner of astronomy, has communicated to me.\nOn February 16, old style, at 5h in the morning, he took the planet\u2019s distances from the tail of Leo (for the latitude), from the neck of Leo,30 and, on the other hand, from the bright star in the southern wing of Virgo, so as to check its longitude by working it out twice.\nI could make use of Tycho\u2019s line of reasoning, which he routinely adopted in volume I of the Progymnasmata when (as here) the declination of the planet was not known. But because that method extends to ten operations, I prefer for the sake of brevity to proceed as I did before with my own observations. Here there are no hidden dangers.\nFirst, the star in the wing of Virgo, adjusted to our time, is at 4\u00b0 36\u2019 30\u201c Libra with latitude 2\u00b0 50\u2019 north. Fabricius found that Mars is 20\u00b0 18\u2019 westward from it on the zodiac, which puts Mars at about 14\u00b0 18\u2019 30\u201c Virgo. This is a preliminary, approximate figure: the longitude will shortly be corrected. Now the tail of Leo31 is at 16\u00b0 4\u2019 Virgo, with latitude 12\u00b0 18\u2019 North, and Mars was found to be 8\u00b0 17\u2019 distant from the Tail. What is sought is the distance of its parallel from the Tail, since the difference in longitude is 1\u00b0 45\u2019. Dividing the secant of 8\u00b0 17\u2019 by the secant of 1\u00b0 45\u2019 gives the secant of 8\u00b0 6\u2019, the arc sought. This subtracted from the fixed star\u2019s northern latitude of 12\u00b0 18\u2019 leaves Mars\u2019s latitude, 4\u00b0 12\u2019 north. This I now take as determined, and compare it with the latitudes of the fixed stars according to the laws of trigonometry. From the Wing of Virgo, I find Mars\u2019s longitude to be 14\u00b0 19\u2019 Virgo; from the Neck of Leo, 14\u00b0 23\u2019 36\u201c. The mean of these two is 14\u00b0 21\u2019 18\u201c Virgo. And since the sextant gave distances larger than the truth, the latitude would come out at 4\u00b0 14\u2019 north.\nOn the night following February 23, at 12h, he observed Mars in relation to five fixed stars: the Tail of Leo and Arcturus for latitude, and for the longitude, in the first instance, Spica (which followed it), and, in the second, the Neck of Leo and Cor Leonis (which preceded it).\nBy a rough estimate, I foresee that Mars is going to fall at 11\u00bc\u00b0 Virgo. It was found to be 9\u00b0 24\u2019 from the Tail of Leo, and hence, its latitude comes out at 4\u00b0 6\u2019 ^32. And now, through this and the latitudes of the fixed stars, together with their distances (17\u00b0 26\u2019 from Regulus, 17\u00b0 51\u2019 from the Neck of Leo, 37\u00b0 28\u2019 from Spica, 44\u00b0 15\u2019 from Arcturus), Mars\u2019s position comes out at 11\u00b0 21\u2019 23\u201c Virgo (from Regulus), 11\u00b0 20\u2019 52\u201c Virgo (from the Neck of Leo), and 11\u00b0 17\u2019 40\u201c (from Spica). Again (as you see) the distances err in being too great. For from the Heart and the Neck [of Leo], Mars is pushed a little eastward, and from Spica and Arcturus a little westward, and more from Arcturus, owing to its greater northern latitude ^33. The mean (ignoring Arcturus), 11\u00b0 19\u2019 20\u201c Virgo, is very nearly true. Also, the latitude is greater, namely, 4\u00b0 7\u2019 40\u201c north. Now from February 15 at 17h to 23 February at 12h, a period of 7 days 19 hours, Mars moved 3\u00b0 0\u2019: 180 minutes in 187 hours. That is, about one minute per hour. And if you wish to take it into account, the parallax (if any) is subtracted from the longitude on February 16 and a little is added on February 23.\n Because the last observation follows the time of observation found by me by 2 days 21 hours 47 min., add the motion corresponding to this time, 1\u00b0 7\u2019: the position will come out 12\u00b0 26\u2019 Virgo. The agreement is thus very good\u2014it could not be better\u2014given that both of us [that is, Kepler and Fabricius] work independently and do not rely on the facilities used by Tycho Brahe.","1745":"VIII. On 1595 October 30 at 8h 20m, the planet was found at 17\u00b0 47\u2019 15\u201c Taurus,19 not far from the nonagesimal. We may thus be sure of the parallax, although we must take it into account. The latitude was 0\u00b0 5\u2019 10\u201c north. The sun\u2019s position was 16\u00b0 50\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio. The distance between the stars was 56\u2019 45\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 35\u201c; that of Mars, 22\u2019 54\u201c, as appears by comparing the nearby observations. The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 23\u2019 29\u201c. If the distance between the stars be divided by this, it comes out to 40\u2019 47\u201c of a day, or 16 hours 19 min. Therefore, the true opposition was 0h 39m PM on October 31. Mars\u2019s position was 17\u00b0 31\u2019 40\u201c Taurus. This needs no reduction to the orbit, as it is nearly at the node. The latitude was about 0\u00b0 8\u2019 north. But comparison with the preceding and following days shows a latitude of about 5\u2019 north.\nIX. Let, at any rate, Mars\u2019s position on 1597 December 10 at 8h 30m be 3\u00b0 45\u00bd\u2019 Cancer (as above) ^20. The sun\u2019s position was 29\u00b0 4\u2019 53\u201c Sagittarius. The distance between the stars was 4\u00b0 40\u2019 37\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 61\u2019 20\u201c, that of Mars 23\u2019 40\u201c (for in 1580 the diurnal motion in Gemini was 23\u2019, and in 1582, at 17\u00b0 Cancer, it was 24\u2019). Therefore, the sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 25\u2019 0\u201c. These data show that the time of true opposition followed 3 days 7 hours 14 min. later, on December 14 at 3h 44m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 2\u00b0 27\u2153\u2019 Cancer. The reduction to the orbit (quite ridiculous here, since the observation itself has an uncertainty of several minutes) requires the addition of about 52\u201c. Therefore, the corrected position was 2\u00b0 28\u2019 Cancer. The latitude, from the table, was 3\u00b0 33\u2019 north.\nOn the same night, the one following December 10, at 12\u2159h, Fabricius in East Frisia found Mars\u2019s position to be 3\u00b0 40\u00bc\u2019 Cancer with latitude 3\u00b0 23\u2019 N. In this observation the longitude comes out nearly the same. For the motion over 3h 40m is 3\u00bd\u2019, so that in the Brahean observation too, at 12\u2159h Mars could have been at 3\u00b0 42\u2019 Cancer\u2014two minutes beyond the Fabrician position.\nX. On 1600 January 13\/23 at 11h 40m, the time being adjusted to Uraniborg time, the planet was observed at 10\u00b0 38\u2019 46\u201c Leo ^21. The sun\u2019s position was 3\u00b0 26\u2019 30\u201c Aquarius. The stars were 7\u00b0 12\u2019 16\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion for the next few days was 1\u00b0 1\u2019 3\u201c; that of Mars, 23\u2019 44\u201c. The sum: 1\u00b0 24\u2019 47\u201c. The opposition therefore followed 5 days 2h 22m after; that is, on January 19\/29 at 2h 2m in the morning, before dawn. Mars was at 8\u00b0 38\u2019 Leo. There is no need for reduction, since it is near the limit. The latitude, from the table, was 4\u00b0 30\u2019 50\u201c N.\nXI. On the evening of 1602 Febr. 18\/28 at 10h 30m, using the Tychonic  instruments (with the help of the learned Matthias Seiffard,22 bequeathed us by Tycho), I took the distance of Mars from the middle star of the tail of Ursa Major 23 to be 52\u00b0 22\u2019. And since the distance between Cor Leonis and Procyon was 37\u00b0 22\u2019 20\u201c, which should have been 37\u00b0 19\u2019 50\u201c,24 we know that the sextant reads 2\u00bd minutes high. Therefore, the corrected distance of Mars from the tail of Ursa was 52\u00b0 19\u00bd\u2019. And since the latitude of the fixed star is 56\u00b0 22\u2019, the remainder, by subtraction, is 4\u00b0 2\u00bd\u2019\u2014supposing that Mars was at precisely the same longitude as the fixed star. But because there was a difference of 3\u00be degrees between them (as is clear from the following observations), a slight correction is required.\n For let AB be 3\u00b0 43\u2019 30\u201c on a parallel close to the ecliptic, B Mars, C the fixed star, and BC 52\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c. Dividing the secant of BC by the secant of AB gives the  secant of CA, 52\u00b0 14\u2019, which, subtracted from 56\u00b0 22\u2019 (the latitude of the fixed star) leaves 4\u00b0 8\u2019 north as Mars\u2019s observed latitude. At the same time, we found 19\u00b0 23\u2019 between Mars and Cor Leonis (19\u00b0 20\u00bd corrected), and 21\u00b0 20\u2019 between Mars and the bright star in the wing of Virgo25 (21\u00b0 17\u00bd\u2019 corrected). From these two distances (using the latitudes of the stars and Mars), Mars\u2019s longitude is found to be 13\u00b0 19\u2019 6\u201c Virgo, by consensus of all measurements.\nAlternatively, the meridian altitude of Mars was found at 12h 40m, using two quadrants, to be 50\u00b0 19\u2019, while the tail of Leo26 was 56\u00b0 45\u2019. Therefore, from the declinations and right ascensions of the fixed stars and our distances, Mars\u2019s position is determined as 13\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c Virgo, latitude 4\u00b0 7\u2019 55\u201c ^27. This is the Tychonic procedure. I have included the other for the sake of showing a consensus, and also that it might be evident that despite the lack of absolute perfection in the demonstration, short cuts either in computation or in our understanding can under certain circumstances be applied. For in that previous procedure there is less in the actual work than in the reporting of it. At Prague, 5\u00b0 Scorpio was rising ^28. Therefore, the nonagesimal was about 32\u00bd\u00b0 from the zenith. And since Mars\u2019s distance from the earth was rather more than half the sun\u2019s distance, the resulting parallax of about 5\u2019 opposite 32\u00bd\u00b0 in our parallactic table, shows a latitudinal parallax of 2\u2019 41\u201c. Thus the latitude as seen from the middle of the earth would be 4\u00b0 10\u2154\u2019 north. And because the altitude of the nonagesimal was 57\u00bd\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax at the horizon was 4\u2019 13\u201c. But since Mars was 38\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, the longitudinal parallax corresponding to this position is 2\u2019 36\u201c, and if this be eliminated, Mars would be placed at about 13\u00b0 18\u2019 Virgo ^29. At that moment, the sun\u2019s position was 10\u00b0 16\u2019 42\u201c Pisces. The distance between the bodies was 3\u00b0 1\u2019 18\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 4\u201c, and that of Mars, 24\u2019 5\u201c (for it was 24\u2019 18\u201c at 21\u00b0 Leo in 1585, and 24\u2019 at 26 Virgo in 1587). The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 24\u2019 9\u201c. The true opposition therefore followed 2 days 3 hours 43 minutes later, on 21 February\/3 March before dawn at 2h 13m, Mars being at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 35\u201c Virgo. Forty seconds must be subtracted to reduce the position to the orbit, putting Mars at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 Virgo, with slightly less latitude than before, since the latitude was then decreasing. It was therefore about 4\u00b0 10\u2019, or 4\u00b0 7\u2153\u2019 if the parallax be neglected.\n But because, since Tycho\u2019s death, we have not made frequent observations nor continued them over several days, it would be best, for certainty\u2019s sake, also to make use of those observations which David Fabricius of East Frisia, a sedulous practitioner of astronomy, has communicated to me.\nOn February 16, old style, at 5h in the morning, he took the planet\u2019s distances from the tail of Leo (for the latitude), from the neck of Leo,30 and, on the other hand, from the bright star in the southern wing of Virgo, so as to check its longitude by working it out twice.\nI could make use of Tycho\u2019s line of reasoning, which he routinely adopted in volume I of the Progymnasmata when (as here) the declination of the planet was not known. But because that method extends to ten operations, I prefer for the sake of brevity to proceed as I did before with my own observations. Here there are no hidden dangers.\nFirst, the star in the wing of Virgo, adjusted to our time, is at 4\u00b0 36\u2019 30\u201c Libra with latitude 2\u00b0 50\u2019 north. Fabricius found that Mars is 20\u00b0 18\u2019 westward from it on the zodiac, which puts Mars at about 14\u00b0 18\u2019 30\u201c Virgo. This is a preliminary, approximate figure: the longitude will shortly be corrected. Now the tail of Leo31 is at 16\u00b0 4\u2019 Virgo, with latitude 12\u00b0 18\u2019 North, and Mars was found to be 8\u00b0 17\u2019 distant from the Tail. What is sought is the distance of its parallel from the Tail, since the difference in longitude is 1\u00b0 45\u2019. Dividing the secant of 8\u00b0 17\u2019 by the secant of 1\u00b0 45\u2019 gives the secant of 8\u00b0 6\u2019, the arc sought. This subtracted from the fixed star\u2019s northern latitude of 12\u00b0 18\u2019 leaves Mars\u2019s latitude, 4\u00b0 12\u2019 north. This I now take as determined, and compare it with the latitudes of the fixed stars according to the laws of trigonometry. From the Wing of Virgo, I find Mars\u2019s longitude to be 14\u00b0 19\u2019 Virgo; from the Neck of Leo, 14\u00b0 23\u2019 36\u201c. The mean of these two is 14\u00b0 21\u2019 18\u201c Virgo. And since the sextant gave distances larger than the truth, the latitude would come out at 4\u00b0 14\u2019 north.\nOn the night following February 23, at 12h, he observed Mars in relation to five fixed stars: the Tail of Leo and Arcturus for latitude, and for the longitude, in the first instance, Spica (which followed it), and, in the second, the Neck of Leo and Cor Leonis (which preceded it).\nBy a rough estimate, I foresee that Mars is going to fall at 11\u00bc\u00b0 Virgo. It was found to be 9\u00b0 24\u2019 from the Tail of Leo, and hence, its latitude comes out at 4\u00b0 6\u2019 ^32. And now, through this and the latitudes of the fixed stars, together with their distances (17\u00b0 26\u2019 from Regulus, 17\u00b0 51\u2019 from the Neck of Leo, 37\u00b0 28\u2019 from Spica, 44\u00b0 15\u2019 from Arcturus), Mars\u2019s position comes out at 11\u00b0 21\u2019 23\u201c Virgo (from Regulus), 11\u00b0 20\u2019 52\u201c Virgo (from the Neck of Leo), and 11\u00b0 17\u2019 40\u201c (from Spica). Again (as you see) the distances err in being too great. For from the Heart and the Neck [of Leo], Mars is pushed a little eastward, and from Spica and Arcturus a little westward, and more from Arcturus, owing to its greater northern latitude ^33. The mean (ignoring Arcturus), 11\u00b0 19\u2019 20\u201c Virgo, is very nearly true. Also, the latitude is greater, namely, 4\u00b0 7\u2019 40\u201c north. Now from February 15 at 17h to 23 February at 12h, a period of 7 days 19 hours, Mars moved 3\u00b0 0\u2019: 180 minutes in 187 hours. That is, about one minute per hour. And if you wish to take it into account, the parallax (if any) is subtracted from the longitude on February 16 and a little is added on February 23.\n Because the last observation follows the time of observation found by me by 2 days 21 hours 47 min., add the motion corresponding to this time, 1\u00b0 7\u2019: the position will come out 12\u00b0 26\u2019 Virgo. The agreement is thus very good\u2014it could not be better\u2014given that both of us [that is, Kepler and Fabricius] work independently and do not rely on the facilities used by Tycho Brahe.","1746":"VIII. On 1595 October 30 at 8h 20m, the planet was found at 17\u00b0 47\u2019 15\u201c Taurus,19 not far from the nonagesimal. We may thus be sure of the parallax, although we must take it into account. The latitude was 0\u00b0 5\u2019 10\u201c north. The sun\u2019s position was 16\u00b0 50\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio. The distance between the stars was 56\u2019 45\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 35\u201c; that of Mars, 22\u2019 54\u201c, as appears by comparing the nearby observations. The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 23\u2019 29\u201c. If the distance between the stars be divided by this, it comes out to 40\u2019 47\u201c of a day, or 16 hours 19 min. Therefore, the true opposition was 0h 39m PM on October 31. Mars\u2019s position was 17\u00b0 31\u2019 40\u201c Taurus. This needs no reduction to the orbit, as it is nearly at the node. The latitude was about 0\u00b0 8\u2019 north. But comparison with the preceding and following days shows a latitude of about 5\u2019 north.\nIX. Let, at any rate, Mars\u2019s position on 1597 December 10 at 8h 30m be 3\u00b0 45\u00bd\u2019 Cancer (as above) ^20. The sun\u2019s position was 29\u00b0 4\u2019 53\u201c Sagittarius. The distance between the stars was 4\u00b0 40\u2019 37\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 61\u2019 20\u201c, that of Mars 23\u2019 40\u201c (for in 1580 the diurnal motion in Gemini was 23\u2019, and in 1582, at 17\u00b0 Cancer, it was 24\u2019). Therefore, the sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 25\u2019 0\u201c. These data show that the time of true opposition followed 3 days 7 hours 14 min. later, on December 14 at 3h 44m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 2\u00b0 27\u2153\u2019 Cancer. The reduction to the orbit (quite ridiculous here, since the observation itself has an uncertainty of several minutes) requires the addition of about 52\u201c. Therefore, the corrected position was 2\u00b0 28\u2019 Cancer. The latitude, from the table, was 3\u00b0 33\u2019 north.\nOn the same night, the one following December 10, at 12\u2159h, Fabricius in East Frisia found Mars\u2019s position to be 3\u00b0 40\u00bc\u2019 Cancer with latitude 3\u00b0 23\u2019 N. In this observation the longitude comes out nearly the same. For the motion over 3h 40m is 3\u00bd\u2019, so that in the Brahean observation too, at 12\u2159h Mars could have been at 3\u00b0 42\u2019 Cancer\u2014two minutes beyond the Fabrician position.\nX. On 1600 January 13\/23 at 11h 40m, the time being adjusted to Uraniborg time, the planet was observed at 10\u00b0 38\u2019 46\u201c Leo ^21. The sun\u2019s position was 3\u00b0 26\u2019 30\u201c Aquarius. The stars were 7\u00b0 12\u2019 16\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion for the next few days was 1\u00b0 1\u2019 3\u201c; that of Mars, 23\u2019 44\u201c. The sum: 1\u00b0 24\u2019 47\u201c. The opposition therefore followed 5 days 2h 22m after; that is, on January 19\/29 at 2h 2m in the morning, before dawn. Mars was at 8\u00b0 38\u2019 Leo. There is no need for reduction, since it is near the limit. The latitude, from the table, was 4\u00b0 30\u2019 50\u201c N.\nXI. On the evening of 1602 Febr. 18\/28 at 10h 30m, using the Tychonic  instruments (with the help of the learned Matthias Seiffard,22 bequeathed us by Tycho), I took the distance of Mars from the middle star of the tail of Ursa Major 23 to be 52\u00b0 22\u2019. And since the distance between Cor Leonis and Procyon was 37\u00b0 22\u2019 20\u201c, which should have been 37\u00b0 19\u2019 50\u201c,24 we know that the sextant reads 2\u00bd minutes high. Therefore, the corrected distance of Mars from the tail of Ursa was 52\u00b0 19\u00bd\u2019. And since the latitude of the fixed star is 56\u00b0 22\u2019, the remainder, by subtraction, is 4\u00b0 2\u00bd\u2019\u2014supposing that Mars was at precisely the same longitude as the fixed star. But because there was a difference of 3\u00be degrees between them (as is clear from the following observations), a slight correction is required.\n For let AB be 3\u00b0 43\u2019 30\u201c on a parallel close to the ecliptic, B Mars, C the fixed star, and BC 52\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c. Dividing the secant of BC by the secant of AB gives the  secant of CA, 52\u00b0 14\u2019, which, subtracted from 56\u00b0 22\u2019 (the latitude of the fixed star) leaves 4\u00b0 8\u2019 north as Mars\u2019s observed latitude. At the same time, we found 19\u00b0 23\u2019 between Mars and Cor Leonis (19\u00b0 20\u00bd corrected), and 21\u00b0 20\u2019 between Mars and the bright star in the wing of Virgo25 (21\u00b0 17\u00bd\u2019 corrected). From these two distances (using the latitudes of the stars and Mars), Mars\u2019s longitude is found to be 13\u00b0 19\u2019 6\u201c Virgo, by consensus of all measurements.\nAlternatively, the meridian altitude of Mars was found at 12h 40m, using two quadrants, to be 50\u00b0 19\u2019, while the tail of Leo26 was 56\u00b0 45\u2019. Therefore, from the declinations and right ascensions of the fixed stars and our distances, Mars\u2019s position is determined as 13\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c Virgo, latitude 4\u00b0 7\u2019 55\u201c ^27. This is the Tychonic procedure. I have included the other for the sake of showing a consensus, and also that it might be evident that despite the lack of absolute perfection in the demonstration, short cuts either in computation or in our understanding can under certain circumstances be applied. For in that previous procedure there is less in the actual work than in the reporting of it. At Prague, 5\u00b0 Scorpio was rising ^28. Therefore, the nonagesimal was about 32\u00bd\u00b0 from the zenith. And since Mars\u2019s distance from the earth was rather more than half the sun\u2019s distance, the resulting parallax of about 5\u2019 opposite 32\u00bd\u00b0 in our parallactic table, shows a latitudinal parallax of 2\u2019 41\u201c. Thus the latitude as seen from the middle of the earth would be 4\u00b0 10\u2154\u2019 north. And because the altitude of the nonagesimal was 57\u00bd\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax at the horizon was 4\u2019 13\u201c. But since Mars was 38\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, the longitudinal parallax corresponding to this position is 2\u2019 36\u201c, and if this be eliminated, Mars would be placed at about 13\u00b0 18\u2019 Virgo ^29. At that moment, the sun\u2019s position was 10\u00b0 16\u2019 42\u201c Pisces. The distance between the bodies was 3\u00b0 1\u2019 18\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 4\u201c, and that of Mars, 24\u2019 5\u201c (for it was 24\u2019 18\u201c at 21\u00b0 Leo in 1585, and 24\u2019 at 26 Virgo in 1587). The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 24\u2019 9\u201c. The true opposition therefore followed 2 days 3 hours 43 minutes later, on 21 February\/3 March before dawn at 2h 13m, Mars being at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 35\u201c Virgo. Forty seconds must be subtracted to reduce the position to the orbit, putting Mars at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 Virgo, with slightly less latitude than before, since the latitude was then decreasing. It was therefore about 4\u00b0 10\u2019, or 4\u00b0 7\u2153\u2019 if the parallax be neglected.\n But because, since Tycho\u2019s death, we have not made frequent observations nor continued them over several days, it would be best, for certainty\u2019s sake, also to make use of those observations which David Fabricius of East Frisia, a sedulous practitioner of astronomy, has communicated to me.\nOn February 16, old style, at 5h in the morning, he took the planet\u2019s distances from the tail of Leo (for the latitude), from the neck of Leo,30 and, on the other hand, from the bright star in the southern wing of Virgo, so as to check its longitude by working it out twice.\nI could make use of Tycho\u2019s line of reasoning, which he routinely adopted in volume I of the Progymnasmata when (as here) the declination of the planet was not known. But because that method extends to ten operations, I prefer for the sake of brevity to proceed as I did before with my own observations. Here there are no hidden dangers.\nFirst, the star in the wing of Virgo, adjusted to our time, is at 4\u00b0 36\u2019 30\u201c Libra with latitude 2\u00b0 50\u2019 north. Fabricius found that Mars is 20\u00b0 18\u2019 westward from it on the zodiac, which puts Mars at about 14\u00b0 18\u2019 30\u201c Virgo. This is a preliminary, approximate figure: the longitude will shortly be corrected. Now the tail of Leo31 is at 16\u00b0 4\u2019 Virgo, with latitude 12\u00b0 18\u2019 North, and Mars was found to be 8\u00b0 17\u2019 distant from the Tail. What is sought is the distance of its parallel from the Tail, since the difference in longitude is 1\u00b0 45\u2019. Dividing the secant of 8\u00b0 17\u2019 by the secant of 1\u00b0 45\u2019 gives the secant of 8\u00b0 6\u2019, the arc sought. This subtracted from the fixed star\u2019s northern latitude of 12\u00b0 18\u2019 leaves Mars\u2019s latitude, 4\u00b0 12\u2019 north. This I now take as determined, and compare it with the latitudes of the fixed stars according to the laws of trigonometry. From the Wing of Virgo, I find Mars\u2019s longitude to be 14\u00b0 19\u2019 Virgo; from the Neck of Leo, 14\u00b0 23\u2019 36\u201c. The mean of these two is 14\u00b0 21\u2019 18\u201c Virgo. And since the sextant gave distances larger than the truth, the latitude would come out at 4\u00b0 14\u2019 north.\nOn the night following February 23, at 12h, he observed Mars in relation to five fixed stars: the Tail of Leo and Arcturus for latitude, and for the longitude, in the first instance, Spica (which followed it), and, in the second, the Neck of Leo and Cor Leonis (which preceded it).\nBy a rough estimate, I foresee that Mars is going to fall at 11\u00bc\u00b0 Virgo. It was found to be 9\u00b0 24\u2019 from the Tail of Leo, and hence, its latitude comes out at 4\u00b0 6\u2019 ^32. And now, through this and the latitudes of the fixed stars, together with their distances (17\u00b0 26\u2019 from Regulus, 17\u00b0 51\u2019 from the Neck of Leo, 37\u00b0 28\u2019 from Spica, 44\u00b0 15\u2019 from Arcturus), Mars\u2019s position comes out at 11\u00b0 21\u2019 23\u201c Virgo (from Regulus), 11\u00b0 20\u2019 52\u201c Virgo (from the Neck of Leo), and 11\u00b0 17\u2019 40\u201c (from Spica). Again (as you see) the distances err in being too great. For from the Heart and the Neck [of Leo], Mars is pushed a little eastward, and from Spica and Arcturus a little westward, and more from Arcturus, owing to its greater northern latitude ^33. The mean (ignoring Arcturus), 11\u00b0 19\u2019 20\u201c Virgo, is very nearly true. Also, the latitude is greater, namely, 4\u00b0 7\u2019 40\u201c north. Now from February 15 at 17h to 23 February at 12h, a period of 7 days 19 hours, Mars moved 3\u00b0 0\u2019: 180 minutes in 187 hours. That is, about one minute per hour. And if you wish to take it into account, the parallax (if any) is subtracted from the longitude on February 16 and a little is added on February 23.\n Because the last observation follows the time of observation found by me by 2 days 21 hours 47 min., add the motion corresponding to this time, 1\u00b0 7\u2019: the position will come out 12\u00b0 26\u2019 Virgo. The agreement is thus very good\u2014it could not be better\u2014given that both of us [that is, Kepler and Fabricius] work independently and do not rely on the facilities used by Tycho Brahe.","1747":"VIII. On 1595 October 30 at 8h 20m, the planet was found at 17\u00b0 47\u2019 15\u201c Taurus,19 not far from the nonagesimal. We may thus be sure of the parallax, although we must take it into account. The latitude was 0\u00b0 5\u2019 10\u201c north. The sun\u2019s position was 16\u00b0 50\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio. The distance between the stars was 56\u2019 45\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 35\u201c; that of Mars, 22\u2019 54\u201c, as appears by comparing the nearby observations. The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 23\u2019 29\u201c. If the distance between the stars be divided by this, it comes out to 40\u2019 47\u201c of a day, or 16 hours 19 min. Therefore, the true opposition was 0h 39m PM on October 31. Mars\u2019s position was 17\u00b0 31\u2019 40\u201c Taurus. This needs no reduction to the orbit, as it is nearly at the node. The latitude was about 0\u00b0 8\u2019 north. But comparison with the preceding and following days shows a latitude of about 5\u2019 north.\nIX. Let, at any rate, Mars\u2019s position on 1597 December 10 at 8h 30m be 3\u00b0 45\u00bd\u2019 Cancer (as above) ^20. The sun\u2019s position was 29\u00b0 4\u2019 53\u201c Sagittarius. The distance between the stars was 4\u00b0 40\u2019 37\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 61\u2019 20\u201c, that of Mars 23\u2019 40\u201c (for in 1580 the diurnal motion in Gemini was 23\u2019, and in 1582, at 17\u00b0 Cancer, it was 24\u2019). Therefore, the sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 25\u2019 0\u201c. These data show that the time of true opposition followed 3 days 7 hours 14 min. later, on December 14 at 3h 44m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 2\u00b0 27\u2153\u2019 Cancer. The reduction to the orbit (quite ridiculous here, since the observation itself has an uncertainty of several minutes) requires the addition of about 52\u201c. Therefore, the corrected position was 2\u00b0 28\u2019 Cancer. The latitude, from the table, was 3\u00b0 33\u2019 north.\nOn the same night, the one following December 10, at 12\u2159h, Fabricius in East Frisia found Mars\u2019s position to be 3\u00b0 40\u00bc\u2019 Cancer with latitude 3\u00b0 23\u2019 N. In this observation the longitude comes out nearly the same. For the motion over 3h 40m is 3\u00bd\u2019, so that in the Brahean observation too, at 12\u2159h Mars could have been at 3\u00b0 42\u2019 Cancer\u2014two minutes beyond the Fabrician position.\nX. On 1600 January 13\/23 at 11h 40m, the time being adjusted to Uraniborg time, the planet was observed at 10\u00b0 38\u2019 46\u201c Leo ^21. The sun\u2019s position was 3\u00b0 26\u2019 30\u201c Aquarius. The stars were 7\u00b0 12\u2019 16\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion for the next few days was 1\u00b0 1\u2019 3\u201c; that of Mars, 23\u2019 44\u201c. The sum: 1\u00b0 24\u2019 47\u201c. The opposition therefore followed 5 days 2h 22m after; that is, on January 19\/29 at 2h 2m in the morning, before dawn. Mars was at 8\u00b0 38\u2019 Leo. There is no need for reduction, since it is near the limit. The latitude, from the table, was 4\u00b0 30\u2019 50\u201c N.\nXI. On the evening of 1602 Febr. 18\/28 at 10h 30m, using the Tychonic  instruments (with the help of the learned Matthias Seiffard,22 bequeathed us by Tycho), I took the distance of Mars from the middle star of the tail of Ursa Major 23 to be 52\u00b0 22\u2019. And since the distance between Cor Leonis and Procyon was 37\u00b0 22\u2019 20\u201c, which should have been 37\u00b0 19\u2019 50\u201c,24 we know that the sextant reads 2\u00bd minutes high. Therefore, the corrected distance of Mars from the tail of Ursa was 52\u00b0 19\u00bd\u2019. And since the latitude of the fixed star is 56\u00b0 22\u2019, the remainder, by subtraction, is 4\u00b0 2\u00bd\u2019\u2014supposing that Mars was at precisely the same longitude as the fixed star. But because there was a difference of 3\u00be degrees between them (as is clear from the following observations), a slight correction is required.\n For let AB be 3\u00b0 43\u2019 30\u201c on a parallel close to the ecliptic, B Mars, C the fixed star, and BC 52\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c. Dividing the secant of BC by the secant of AB gives the  secant of CA, 52\u00b0 14\u2019, which, subtracted from 56\u00b0 22\u2019 (the latitude of the fixed star) leaves 4\u00b0 8\u2019 north as Mars\u2019s observed latitude. At the same time, we found 19\u00b0 23\u2019 between Mars and Cor Leonis (19\u00b0 20\u00bd corrected), and 21\u00b0 20\u2019 between Mars and the bright star in the wing of Virgo25 (21\u00b0 17\u00bd\u2019 corrected). From these two distances (using the latitudes of the stars and Mars), Mars\u2019s longitude is found to be 13\u00b0 19\u2019 6\u201c Virgo, by consensus of all measurements.\nAlternatively, the meridian altitude of Mars was found at 12h 40m, using two quadrants, to be 50\u00b0 19\u2019, while the tail of Leo26 was 56\u00b0 45\u2019. Therefore, from the declinations and right ascensions of the fixed stars and our distances, Mars\u2019s position is determined as 13\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c Virgo, latitude 4\u00b0 7\u2019 55\u201c ^27. This is the Tychonic procedure. I have included the other for the sake of showing a consensus, and also that it might be evident that despite the lack of absolute perfection in the demonstration, short cuts either in computation or in our understanding can under certain circumstances be applied. For in that previous procedure there is less in the actual work than in the reporting of it. At Prague, 5\u00b0 Scorpio was rising ^28. Therefore, the nonagesimal was about 32\u00bd\u00b0 from the zenith. And since Mars\u2019s distance from the earth was rather more than half the sun\u2019s distance, the resulting parallax of about 5\u2019 opposite 32\u00bd\u00b0 in our parallactic table, shows a latitudinal parallax of 2\u2019 41\u201c. Thus the latitude as seen from the middle of the earth would be 4\u00b0 10\u2154\u2019 north. And because the altitude of the nonagesimal was 57\u00bd\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax at the horizon was 4\u2019 13\u201c. But since Mars was 38\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, the longitudinal parallax corresponding to this position is 2\u2019 36\u201c, and if this be eliminated, Mars would be placed at about 13\u00b0 18\u2019 Virgo ^29. At that moment, the sun\u2019s position was 10\u00b0 16\u2019 42\u201c Pisces. The distance between the bodies was 3\u00b0 1\u2019 18\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 4\u201c, and that of Mars, 24\u2019 5\u201c (for it was 24\u2019 18\u201c at 21\u00b0 Leo in 1585, and 24\u2019 at 26 Virgo in 1587). The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 24\u2019 9\u201c. The true opposition therefore followed 2 days 3 hours 43 minutes later, on 21 February\/3 March before dawn at 2h 13m, Mars being at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 35\u201c Virgo. Forty seconds must be subtracted to reduce the position to the orbit, putting Mars at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 Virgo, with slightly less latitude than before, since the latitude was then decreasing. It was therefore about 4\u00b0 10\u2019, or 4\u00b0 7\u2153\u2019 if the parallax be neglected.\n But because, since Tycho\u2019s death, we have not made frequent observations nor continued them over several days, it would be best, for certainty\u2019s sake, also to make use of those observations which David Fabricius of East Frisia, a sedulous practitioner of astronomy, has communicated to me.\nOn February 16, old style, at 5h in the morning, he took the planet\u2019s distances from the tail of Leo (for the latitude), from the neck of Leo,30 and, on the other hand, from the bright star in the southern wing of Virgo, so as to check its longitude by working it out twice.\nI could make use of Tycho\u2019s line of reasoning, which he routinely adopted in volume I of the Progymnasmata when (as here) the declination of the planet was not known. But because that method extends to ten operations, I prefer for the sake of brevity to proceed as I did before with my own observations. Here there are no hidden dangers.\nFirst, the star in the wing of Virgo, adjusted to our time, is at 4\u00b0 36\u2019 30\u201c Libra with latitude 2\u00b0 50\u2019 north. Fabricius found that Mars is 20\u00b0 18\u2019 westward from it on the zodiac, which puts Mars at about 14\u00b0 18\u2019 30\u201c Virgo. This is a preliminary, approximate figure: the longitude will shortly be corrected. Now the tail of Leo31 is at 16\u00b0 4\u2019 Virgo, with latitude 12\u00b0 18\u2019 North, and Mars was found to be 8\u00b0 17\u2019 distant from the Tail. What is sought is the distance of its parallel from the Tail, since the difference in longitude is 1\u00b0 45\u2019. Dividing the secant of 8\u00b0 17\u2019 by the secant of 1\u00b0 45\u2019 gives the secant of 8\u00b0 6\u2019, the arc sought. This subtracted from the fixed star\u2019s northern latitude of 12\u00b0 18\u2019 leaves Mars\u2019s latitude, 4\u00b0 12\u2019 north. This I now take as determined, and compare it with the latitudes of the fixed stars according to the laws of trigonometry. From the Wing of Virgo, I find Mars\u2019s longitude to be 14\u00b0 19\u2019 Virgo; from the Neck of Leo, 14\u00b0 23\u2019 36\u201c. The mean of these two is 14\u00b0 21\u2019 18\u201c Virgo. And since the sextant gave distances larger than the truth, the latitude would come out at 4\u00b0 14\u2019 north.\nOn the night following February 23, at 12h, he observed Mars in relation to five fixed stars: the Tail of Leo and Arcturus for latitude, and for the longitude, in the first instance, Spica (which followed it), and, in the second, the Neck of Leo and Cor Leonis (which preceded it).\nBy a rough estimate, I foresee that Mars is going to fall at 11\u00bc\u00b0 Virgo. It was found to be 9\u00b0 24\u2019 from the Tail of Leo, and hence, its latitude comes out at 4\u00b0 6\u2019 ^32. And now, through this and the latitudes of the fixed stars, together with their distances (17\u00b0 26\u2019 from Regulus, 17\u00b0 51\u2019 from the Neck of Leo, 37\u00b0 28\u2019 from Spica, 44\u00b0 15\u2019 from Arcturus), Mars\u2019s position comes out at 11\u00b0 21\u2019 23\u201c Virgo (from Regulus), 11\u00b0 20\u2019 52\u201c Virgo (from the Neck of Leo), and 11\u00b0 17\u2019 40\u201c (from Spica). Again (as you see) the distances err in being too great. For from the Heart and the Neck [of Leo], Mars is pushed a little eastward, and from Spica and Arcturus a little westward, and more from Arcturus, owing to its greater northern latitude ^33. The mean (ignoring Arcturus), 11\u00b0 19\u2019 20\u201c Virgo, is very nearly true. Also, the latitude is greater, namely, 4\u00b0 7\u2019 40\u201c north. Now from February 15 at 17h to 23 February at 12h, a period of 7 days 19 hours, Mars moved 3\u00b0 0\u2019: 180 minutes in 187 hours. That is, about one minute per hour. And if you wish to take it into account, the parallax (if any) is subtracted from the longitude on February 16 and a little is added on February 23.\n Because the last observation follows the time of observation found by me by 2 days 21 hours 47 min., add the motion corresponding to this time, 1\u00b0 7\u2019: the position will come out 12\u00b0 26\u2019 Virgo. The agreement is thus very good\u2014it could not be better\u2014given that both of us [that is, Kepler and Fabricius] work independently and do not rely on the facilities used by Tycho Brahe.","1748":"VIII. On 1595 October 30 at 8h 20m, the planet was found at 17\u00b0 47\u2019 15\u201c Taurus,19 not far from the nonagesimal. We may thus be sure of the parallax, although we must take it into account. The latitude was 0\u00b0 5\u2019 10\u201c north. The sun\u2019s position was 16\u00b0 50\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio. The distance between the stars was 56\u2019 45\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 35\u201c; that of Mars, 22\u2019 54\u201c, as appears by comparing the nearby observations. The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 23\u2019 29\u201c. If the distance between the stars be divided by this, it comes out to 40\u2019 47\u201c of a day, or 16 hours 19 min. Therefore, the true opposition was 0h 39m PM on October 31. Mars\u2019s position was 17\u00b0 31\u2019 40\u201c Taurus. This needs no reduction to the orbit, as it is nearly at the node. The latitude was about 0\u00b0 8\u2019 north. But comparison with the preceding and following days shows a latitude of about 5\u2019 north.\nIX. Let, at any rate, Mars\u2019s position on 1597 December 10 at 8h 30m be 3\u00b0 45\u00bd\u2019 Cancer (as above) ^20. The sun\u2019s position was 29\u00b0 4\u2019 53\u201c Sagittarius. The distance between the stars was 4\u00b0 40\u2019 37\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 61\u2019 20\u201c, that of Mars 23\u2019 40\u201c (for in 1580 the diurnal motion in Gemini was 23\u2019, and in 1582, at 17\u00b0 Cancer, it was 24\u2019). Therefore, the sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 25\u2019 0\u201c. These data show that the time of true opposition followed 3 days 7 hours 14 min. later, on December 14 at 3h 44m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 2\u00b0 27\u2153\u2019 Cancer. The reduction to the orbit (quite ridiculous here, since the observation itself has an uncertainty of several minutes) requires the addition of about 52\u201c. Therefore, the corrected position was 2\u00b0 28\u2019 Cancer. The latitude, from the table, was 3\u00b0 33\u2019 north.\nOn the same night, the one following December 10, at 12\u2159h, Fabricius in East Frisia found Mars\u2019s position to be 3\u00b0 40\u00bc\u2019 Cancer with latitude 3\u00b0 23\u2019 N. In this observation the longitude comes out nearly the same. For the motion over 3h 40m is 3\u00bd\u2019, so that in the Brahean observation too, at 12\u2159h Mars could have been at 3\u00b0 42\u2019 Cancer\u2014two minutes beyond the Fabrician position.\nX. On 1600 January 13\/23 at 11h 40m, the time being adjusted to Uraniborg time, the planet was observed at 10\u00b0 38\u2019 46\u201c Leo ^21. The sun\u2019s position was 3\u00b0 26\u2019 30\u201c Aquarius. The stars were 7\u00b0 12\u2019 16\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion for the next few days was 1\u00b0 1\u2019 3\u201c; that of Mars, 23\u2019 44\u201c. The sum: 1\u00b0 24\u2019 47\u201c. The opposition therefore followed 5 days 2h 22m after; that is, on January 19\/29 at 2h 2m in the morning, before dawn. Mars was at 8\u00b0 38\u2019 Leo. There is no need for reduction, since it is near the limit. The latitude, from the table, was 4\u00b0 30\u2019 50\u201c N.\nXI. On the evening of 1602 Febr. 18\/28 at 10h 30m, using the Tychonic  instruments (with the help of the learned Matthias Seiffard,22 bequeathed us by Tycho), I took the distance of Mars from the middle star of the tail of Ursa Major 23 to be 52\u00b0 22\u2019. And since the distance between Cor Leonis and Procyon was 37\u00b0 22\u2019 20\u201c, which should have been 37\u00b0 19\u2019 50\u201c,24 we know that the sextant reads 2\u00bd minutes high. Therefore, the corrected distance of Mars from the tail of Ursa was 52\u00b0 19\u00bd\u2019. And since the latitude of the fixed star is 56\u00b0 22\u2019, the remainder, by subtraction, is 4\u00b0 2\u00bd\u2019\u2014supposing that Mars was at precisely the same longitude as the fixed star. But because there was a difference of 3\u00be degrees between them (as is clear from the following observations), a slight correction is required.\n For let AB be 3\u00b0 43\u2019 30\u201c on a parallel close to the ecliptic, B Mars, C the fixed star, and BC 52\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c. Dividing the secant of BC by the secant of AB gives the  secant of CA, 52\u00b0 14\u2019, which, subtracted from 56\u00b0 22\u2019 (the latitude of the fixed star) leaves 4\u00b0 8\u2019 north as Mars\u2019s observed latitude. At the same time, we found 19\u00b0 23\u2019 between Mars and Cor Leonis (19\u00b0 20\u00bd corrected), and 21\u00b0 20\u2019 between Mars and the bright star in the wing of Virgo25 (21\u00b0 17\u00bd\u2019 corrected). From these two distances (using the latitudes of the stars and Mars), Mars\u2019s longitude is found to be 13\u00b0 19\u2019 6\u201c Virgo, by consensus of all measurements.\nAlternatively, the meridian altitude of Mars was found at 12h 40m, using two quadrants, to be 50\u00b0 19\u2019, while the tail of Leo26 was 56\u00b0 45\u2019. Therefore, from the declinations and right ascensions of the fixed stars and our distances, Mars\u2019s position is determined as 13\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c Virgo, latitude 4\u00b0 7\u2019 55\u201c ^27. This is the Tychonic procedure. I have included the other for the sake of showing a consensus, and also that it might be evident that despite the lack of absolute perfection in the demonstration, short cuts either in computation or in our understanding can under certain circumstances be applied. For in that previous procedure there is less in the actual work than in the reporting of it. At Prague, 5\u00b0 Scorpio was rising ^28. Therefore, the nonagesimal was about 32\u00bd\u00b0 from the zenith. And since Mars\u2019s distance from the earth was rather more than half the sun\u2019s distance, the resulting parallax of about 5\u2019 opposite 32\u00bd\u00b0 in our parallactic table, shows a latitudinal parallax of 2\u2019 41\u201c. Thus the latitude as seen from the middle of the earth would be 4\u00b0 10\u2154\u2019 north. And because the altitude of the nonagesimal was 57\u00bd\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax at the horizon was 4\u2019 13\u201c. But since Mars was 38\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, the longitudinal parallax corresponding to this position is 2\u2019 36\u201c, and if this be eliminated, Mars would be placed at about 13\u00b0 18\u2019 Virgo ^29. At that moment, the sun\u2019s position was 10\u00b0 16\u2019 42\u201c Pisces. The distance between the bodies was 3\u00b0 1\u2019 18\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 4\u201c, and that of Mars, 24\u2019 5\u201c (for it was 24\u2019 18\u201c at 21\u00b0 Leo in 1585, and 24\u2019 at 26 Virgo in 1587). The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 24\u2019 9\u201c. The true opposition therefore followed 2 days 3 hours 43 minutes later, on 21 February\/3 March before dawn at 2h 13m, Mars being at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 35\u201c Virgo. Forty seconds must be subtracted to reduce the position to the orbit, putting Mars at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 Virgo, with slightly less latitude than before, since the latitude was then decreasing. It was therefore about 4\u00b0 10\u2019, or 4\u00b0 7\u2153\u2019 if the parallax be neglected.\n But because, since Tycho\u2019s death, we have not made frequent observations nor continued them over several days, it would be best, for certainty\u2019s sake, also to make use of those observations which David Fabricius of East Frisia, a sedulous practitioner of astronomy, has communicated to me.\nOn February 16, old style, at 5h in the morning, he took the planet\u2019s distances from the tail of Leo (for the latitude), from the neck of Leo,30 and, on the other hand, from the bright star in the southern wing of Virgo, so as to check its longitude by working it out twice.\nI could make use of Tycho\u2019s line of reasoning, which he routinely adopted in volume I of the Progymnasmata when (as here) the declination of the planet was not known. But because that method extends to ten operations, I prefer for the sake of brevity to proceed as I did before with my own observations. Here there are no hidden dangers.\nFirst, the star in the wing of Virgo, adjusted to our time, is at 4\u00b0 36\u2019 30\u201c Libra with latitude 2\u00b0 50\u2019 north. Fabricius found that Mars is 20\u00b0 18\u2019 westward from it on the zodiac, which puts Mars at about 14\u00b0 18\u2019 30\u201c Virgo. This is a preliminary, approximate figure: the longitude will shortly be corrected. Now the tail of Leo31 is at 16\u00b0 4\u2019 Virgo, with latitude 12\u00b0 18\u2019 North, and Mars was found to be 8\u00b0 17\u2019 distant from the Tail. What is sought is the distance of its parallel from the Tail, since the difference in longitude is 1\u00b0 45\u2019. Dividing the secant of 8\u00b0 17\u2019 by the secant of 1\u00b0 45\u2019 gives the secant of 8\u00b0 6\u2019, the arc sought. This subtracted from the fixed star\u2019s northern latitude of 12\u00b0 18\u2019 leaves Mars\u2019s latitude, 4\u00b0 12\u2019 north. This I now take as determined, and compare it with the latitudes of the fixed stars according to the laws of trigonometry. From the Wing of Virgo, I find Mars\u2019s longitude to be 14\u00b0 19\u2019 Virgo; from the Neck of Leo, 14\u00b0 23\u2019 36\u201c. The mean of these two is 14\u00b0 21\u2019 18\u201c Virgo. And since the sextant gave distances larger than the truth, the latitude would come out at 4\u00b0 14\u2019 north.\nOn the night following February 23, at 12h, he observed Mars in relation to five fixed stars: the Tail of Leo and Arcturus for latitude, and for the longitude, in the first instance, Spica (which followed it), and, in the second, the Neck of Leo and Cor Leonis (which preceded it).\nBy a rough estimate, I foresee that Mars is going to fall at 11\u00bc\u00b0 Virgo. It was found to be 9\u00b0 24\u2019 from the Tail of Leo, and hence, its latitude comes out at 4\u00b0 6\u2019 ^32. And now, through this and the latitudes of the fixed stars, together with their distances (17\u00b0 26\u2019 from Regulus, 17\u00b0 51\u2019 from the Neck of Leo, 37\u00b0 28\u2019 from Spica, 44\u00b0 15\u2019 from Arcturus), Mars\u2019s position comes out at 11\u00b0 21\u2019 23\u201c Virgo (from Regulus), 11\u00b0 20\u2019 52\u201c Virgo (from the Neck of Leo), and 11\u00b0 17\u2019 40\u201c (from Spica). Again (as you see) the distances err in being too great. For from the Heart and the Neck [of Leo], Mars is pushed a little eastward, and from Spica and Arcturus a little westward, and more from Arcturus, owing to its greater northern latitude ^33. The mean (ignoring Arcturus), 11\u00b0 19\u2019 20\u201c Virgo, is very nearly true. Also, the latitude is greater, namely, 4\u00b0 7\u2019 40\u201c north. Now from February 15 at 17h to 23 February at 12h, a period of 7 days 19 hours, Mars moved 3\u00b0 0\u2019: 180 minutes in 187 hours. That is, about one minute per hour. And if you wish to take it into account, the parallax (if any) is subtracted from the longitude on February 16 and a little is added on February 23.\n Because the last observation follows the time of observation found by me by 2 days 21 hours 47 min., add the motion corresponding to this time, 1\u00b0 7\u2019: the position will come out 12\u00b0 26\u2019 Virgo. The agreement is thus very good\u2014it could not be better\u2014given that both of us [that is, Kepler and Fabricius] work independently and do not rely on the facilities used by Tycho Brahe.","1749":"VIII. On 1595 October 30 at 8h 20m, the planet was found at 17\u00b0 47\u2019 15\u201c Taurus,19 not far from the nonagesimal. We may thus be sure of the parallax, although we must take it into account. The latitude was 0\u00b0 5\u2019 10\u201c north. The sun\u2019s position was 16\u00b0 50\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio. The distance between the stars was 56\u2019 45\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 35\u201c; that of Mars, 22\u2019 54\u201c, as appears by comparing the nearby observations. The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 23\u2019 29\u201c. If the distance between the stars be divided by this, it comes out to 40\u2019 47\u201c of a day, or 16 hours 19 min. Therefore, the true opposition was 0h 39m PM on October 31. Mars\u2019s position was 17\u00b0 31\u2019 40\u201c Taurus. This needs no reduction to the orbit, as it is nearly at the node. The latitude was about 0\u00b0 8\u2019 north. But comparison with the preceding and following days shows a latitude of about 5\u2019 north.\nIX. Let, at any rate, Mars\u2019s position on 1597 December 10 at 8h 30m be 3\u00b0 45\u00bd\u2019 Cancer (as above) ^20. The sun\u2019s position was 29\u00b0 4\u2019 53\u201c Sagittarius. The distance between the stars was 4\u00b0 40\u2019 37\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 61\u2019 20\u201c, that of Mars 23\u2019 40\u201c (for in 1580 the diurnal motion in Gemini was 23\u2019, and in 1582, at 17\u00b0 Cancer, it was 24\u2019). Therefore, the sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 25\u2019 0\u201c. These data show that the time of true opposition followed 3 days 7 hours 14 min. later, on December 14 at 3h 44m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 2\u00b0 27\u2153\u2019 Cancer. The reduction to the orbit (quite ridiculous here, since the observation itself has an uncertainty of several minutes) requires the addition of about 52\u201c. Therefore, the corrected position was 2\u00b0 28\u2019 Cancer. The latitude, from the table, was 3\u00b0 33\u2019 north.\nOn the same night, the one following December 10, at 12\u2159h, Fabricius in East Frisia found Mars\u2019s position to be 3\u00b0 40\u00bc\u2019 Cancer with latitude 3\u00b0 23\u2019 N. In this observation the longitude comes out nearly the same. For the motion over 3h 40m is 3\u00bd\u2019, so that in the Brahean observation too, at 12\u2159h Mars could have been at 3\u00b0 42\u2019 Cancer\u2014two minutes beyond the Fabrician position.\nX. On 1600 January 13\/23 at 11h 40m, the time being adjusted to Uraniborg time, the planet was observed at 10\u00b0 38\u2019 46\u201c Leo ^21. The sun\u2019s position was 3\u00b0 26\u2019 30\u201c Aquarius. The stars were 7\u00b0 12\u2019 16\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion for the next few days was 1\u00b0 1\u2019 3\u201c; that of Mars, 23\u2019 44\u201c. The sum: 1\u00b0 24\u2019 47\u201c. The opposition therefore followed 5 days 2h 22m after; that is, on January 19\/29 at 2h 2m in the morning, before dawn. Mars was at 8\u00b0 38\u2019 Leo. There is no need for reduction, since it is near the limit. The latitude, from the table, was 4\u00b0 30\u2019 50\u201c N.\nXI. On the evening of 1602 Febr. 18\/28 at 10h 30m, using the Tychonic  instruments (with the help of the learned Matthias Seiffard,22 bequeathed us by Tycho), I took the distance of Mars from the middle star of the tail of Ursa Major 23 to be 52\u00b0 22\u2019. And since the distance between Cor Leonis and Procyon was 37\u00b0 22\u2019 20\u201c, which should have been 37\u00b0 19\u2019 50\u201c,24 we know that the sextant reads 2\u00bd minutes high. Therefore, the corrected distance of Mars from the tail of Ursa was 52\u00b0 19\u00bd\u2019. And since the latitude of the fixed star is 56\u00b0 22\u2019, the remainder, by subtraction, is 4\u00b0 2\u00bd\u2019\u2014supposing that Mars was at precisely the same longitude as the fixed star. But because there was a difference of 3\u00be degrees between them (as is clear from the following observations), a slight correction is required.\n For let AB be 3\u00b0 43\u2019 30\u201c on a parallel close to the ecliptic, B Mars, C the fixed star, and BC 52\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c. Dividing the secant of BC by the secant of AB gives the  secant of CA, 52\u00b0 14\u2019, which, subtracted from 56\u00b0 22\u2019 (the latitude of the fixed star) leaves 4\u00b0 8\u2019 north as Mars\u2019s observed latitude. At the same time, we found 19\u00b0 23\u2019 between Mars and Cor Leonis (19\u00b0 20\u00bd corrected), and 21\u00b0 20\u2019 between Mars and the bright star in the wing of Virgo25 (21\u00b0 17\u00bd\u2019 corrected). From these two distances (using the latitudes of the stars and Mars), Mars\u2019s longitude is found to be 13\u00b0 19\u2019 6\u201c Virgo, by consensus of all measurements.\nAlternatively, the meridian altitude of Mars was found at 12h 40m, using two quadrants, to be 50\u00b0 19\u2019, while the tail of Leo26 was 56\u00b0 45\u2019. Therefore, from the declinations and right ascensions of the fixed stars and our distances, Mars\u2019s position is determined as 13\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c Virgo, latitude 4\u00b0 7\u2019 55\u201c ^27. This is the Tychonic procedure. I have included the other for the sake of showing a consensus, and also that it might be evident that despite the lack of absolute perfection in the demonstration, short cuts either in computation or in our understanding can under certain circumstances be applied. For in that previous procedure there is less in the actual work than in the reporting of it. At Prague, 5\u00b0 Scorpio was rising ^28. Therefore, the nonagesimal was about 32\u00bd\u00b0 from the zenith. And since Mars\u2019s distance from the earth was rather more than half the sun\u2019s distance, the resulting parallax of about 5\u2019 opposite 32\u00bd\u00b0 in our parallactic table, shows a latitudinal parallax of 2\u2019 41\u201c. Thus the latitude as seen from the middle of the earth would be 4\u00b0 10\u2154\u2019 north. And because the altitude of the nonagesimal was 57\u00bd\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax at the horizon was 4\u2019 13\u201c. But since Mars was 38\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, the longitudinal parallax corresponding to this position is 2\u2019 36\u201c, and if this be eliminated, Mars would be placed at about 13\u00b0 18\u2019 Virgo ^29. At that moment, the sun\u2019s position was 10\u00b0 16\u2019 42\u201c Pisces. The distance between the bodies was 3\u00b0 1\u2019 18\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 4\u201c, and that of Mars, 24\u2019 5\u201c (for it was 24\u2019 18\u201c at 21\u00b0 Leo in 1585, and 24\u2019 at 26 Virgo in 1587). The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 24\u2019 9\u201c. The true opposition therefore followed 2 days 3 hours 43 minutes later, on 21 February\/3 March before dawn at 2h 13m, Mars being at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 35\u201c Virgo. Forty seconds must be subtracted to reduce the position to the orbit, putting Mars at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 Virgo, with slightly less latitude than before, since the latitude was then decreasing. It was therefore about 4\u00b0 10\u2019, or 4\u00b0 7\u2153\u2019 if the parallax be neglected.\n But because, since Tycho\u2019s death, we have not made frequent observations nor continued them over several days, it would be best, for certainty\u2019s sake, also to make use of those observations which David Fabricius of East Frisia, a sedulous practitioner of astronomy, has communicated to me.\nOn February 16, old style, at 5h in the morning, he took the planet\u2019s distances from the tail of Leo (for the latitude), from the neck of Leo,30 and, on the other hand, from the bright star in the southern wing of Virgo, so as to check its longitude by working it out twice.\nI could make use of Tycho\u2019s line of reasoning, which he routinely adopted in volume I of the Progymnasmata when (as here) the declination of the planet was not known. But because that method extends to ten operations, I prefer for the sake of brevity to proceed as I did before with my own observations. Here there are no hidden dangers.\nFirst, the star in the wing of Virgo, adjusted to our time, is at 4\u00b0 36\u2019 30\u201c Libra with latitude 2\u00b0 50\u2019 north. Fabricius found that Mars is 20\u00b0 18\u2019 westward from it on the zodiac, which puts Mars at about 14\u00b0 18\u2019 30\u201c Virgo. This is a preliminary, approximate figure: the longitude will shortly be corrected. Now the tail of Leo31 is at 16\u00b0 4\u2019 Virgo, with latitude 12\u00b0 18\u2019 North, and Mars was found to be 8\u00b0 17\u2019 distant from the Tail. What is sought is the distance of its parallel from the Tail, since the difference in longitude is 1\u00b0 45\u2019. Dividing the secant of 8\u00b0 17\u2019 by the secant of 1\u00b0 45\u2019 gives the secant of 8\u00b0 6\u2019, the arc sought. This subtracted from the fixed star\u2019s northern latitude of 12\u00b0 18\u2019 leaves Mars\u2019s latitude, 4\u00b0 12\u2019 north. This I now take as determined, and compare it with the latitudes of the fixed stars according to the laws of trigonometry. From the Wing of Virgo, I find Mars\u2019s longitude to be 14\u00b0 19\u2019 Virgo; from the Neck of Leo, 14\u00b0 23\u2019 36\u201c. The mean of these two is 14\u00b0 21\u2019 18\u201c Virgo. And since the sextant gave distances larger than the truth, the latitude would come out at 4\u00b0 14\u2019 north.\nOn the night following February 23, at 12h, he observed Mars in relation to five fixed stars: the Tail of Leo and Arcturus for latitude, and for the longitude, in the first instance, Spica (which followed it), and, in the second, the Neck of Leo and Cor Leonis (which preceded it).\nBy a rough estimate, I foresee that Mars is going to fall at 11\u00bc\u00b0 Virgo. It was found to be 9\u00b0 24\u2019 from the Tail of Leo, and hence, its latitude comes out at 4\u00b0 6\u2019 ^32. And now, through this and the latitudes of the fixed stars, together with their distances (17\u00b0 26\u2019 from Regulus, 17\u00b0 51\u2019 from the Neck of Leo, 37\u00b0 28\u2019 from Spica, 44\u00b0 15\u2019 from Arcturus), Mars\u2019s position comes out at 11\u00b0 21\u2019 23\u201c Virgo (from Regulus), 11\u00b0 20\u2019 52\u201c Virgo (from the Neck of Leo), and 11\u00b0 17\u2019 40\u201c (from Spica). Again (as you see) the distances err in being too great. For from the Heart and the Neck [of Leo], Mars is pushed a little eastward, and from Spica and Arcturus a little westward, and more from Arcturus, owing to its greater northern latitude ^33. The mean (ignoring Arcturus), 11\u00b0 19\u2019 20\u201c Virgo, is very nearly true. Also, the latitude is greater, namely, 4\u00b0 7\u2019 40\u201c north. Now from February 15 at 17h to 23 February at 12h, a period of 7 days 19 hours, Mars moved 3\u00b0 0\u2019: 180 minutes in 187 hours. That is, about one minute per hour. And if you wish to take it into account, the parallax (if any) is subtracted from the longitude on February 16 and a little is added on February 23.\n Because the last observation follows the time of observation found by me by 2 days 21 hours 47 min., add the motion corresponding to this time, 1\u00b0 7\u2019: the position will come out 12\u00b0 26\u2019 Virgo. The agreement is thus very good\u2014it could not be better\u2014given that both of us [that is, Kepler and Fabricius] work independently and do not rely on the facilities used by Tycho Brahe.","1750":"VIII. On 1595 October 30 at 8h 20m, the planet was found at 17\u00b0 47\u2019 15\u201c Taurus,19 not far from the nonagesimal. We may thus be sure of the parallax, although we must take it into account. The latitude was 0\u00b0 5\u2019 10\u201c north. The sun\u2019s position was 16\u00b0 50\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio. The distance between the stars was 56\u2019 45\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 35\u201c; that of Mars, 22\u2019 54\u201c, as appears by comparing the nearby observations. The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 23\u2019 29\u201c. If the distance between the stars be divided by this, it comes out to 40\u2019 47\u201c of a day, or 16 hours 19 min. Therefore, the true opposition was 0h 39m PM on October 31. Mars\u2019s position was 17\u00b0 31\u2019 40\u201c Taurus. This needs no reduction to the orbit, as it is nearly at the node. The latitude was about 0\u00b0 8\u2019 north. But comparison with the preceding and following days shows a latitude of about 5\u2019 north.\nIX. Let, at any rate, Mars\u2019s position on 1597 December 10 at 8h 30m be 3\u00b0 45\u00bd\u2019 Cancer (as above) ^20. The sun\u2019s position was 29\u00b0 4\u2019 53\u201c Sagittarius. The distance between the stars was 4\u00b0 40\u2019 37\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 61\u2019 20\u201c, that of Mars 23\u2019 40\u201c (for in 1580 the diurnal motion in Gemini was 23\u2019, and in 1582, at 17\u00b0 Cancer, it was 24\u2019). Therefore, the sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 25\u2019 0\u201c. These data show that the time of true opposition followed 3 days 7 hours 14 min. later, on December 14 at 3h 44m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 2\u00b0 27\u2153\u2019 Cancer. The reduction to the orbit (quite ridiculous here, since the observation itself has an uncertainty of several minutes) requires the addition of about 52\u201c. Therefore, the corrected position was 2\u00b0 28\u2019 Cancer. The latitude, from the table, was 3\u00b0 33\u2019 north.\nOn the same night, the one following December 10, at 12\u2159h, Fabricius in East Frisia found Mars\u2019s position to be 3\u00b0 40\u00bc\u2019 Cancer with latitude 3\u00b0 23\u2019 N. In this observation the longitude comes out nearly the same. For the motion over 3h 40m is 3\u00bd\u2019, so that in the Brahean observation too, at 12\u2159h Mars could have been at 3\u00b0 42\u2019 Cancer\u2014two minutes beyond the Fabrician position.\nX. On 1600 January 13\/23 at 11h 40m, the time being adjusted to Uraniborg time, the planet was observed at 10\u00b0 38\u2019 46\u201c Leo ^21. The sun\u2019s position was 3\u00b0 26\u2019 30\u201c Aquarius. The stars were 7\u00b0 12\u2019 16\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion for the next few days was 1\u00b0 1\u2019 3\u201c; that of Mars, 23\u2019 44\u201c. The sum: 1\u00b0 24\u2019 47\u201c. The opposition therefore followed 5 days 2h 22m after; that is, on January 19\/29 at 2h 2m in the morning, before dawn. Mars was at 8\u00b0 38\u2019 Leo. There is no need for reduction, since it is near the limit. The latitude, from the table, was 4\u00b0 30\u2019 50\u201c N.\nXI. On the evening of 1602 Febr. 18\/28 at 10h 30m, using the Tychonic  instruments (with the help of the learned Matthias Seiffard,22 bequeathed us by Tycho), I took the distance of Mars from the middle star of the tail of Ursa Major 23 to be 52\u00b0 22\u2019. And since the distance between Cor Leonis and Procyon was 37\u00b0 22\u2019 20\u201c, which should have been 37\u00b0 19\u2019 50\u201c,24 we know that the sextant reads 2\u00bd minutes high. Therefore, the corrected distance of Mars from the tail of Ursa was 52\u00b0 19\u00bd\u2019. And since the latitude of the fixed star is 56\u00b0 22\u2019, the remainder, by subtraction, is 4\u00b0 2\u00bd\u2019\u2014supposing that Mars was at precisely the same longitude as the fixed star. But because there was a difference of 3\u00be degrees between them (as is clear from the following observations), a slight correction is required.\n For let AB be 3\u00b0 43\u2019 30\u201c on a parallel close to the ecliptic, B Mars, C the fixed star, and BC 52\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c. Dividing the secant of BC by the secant of AB gives the  secant of CA, 52\u00b0 14\u2019, which, subtracted from 56\u00b0 22\u2019 (the latitude of the fixed star) leaves 4\u00b0 8\u2019 north as Mars\u2019s observed latitude. At the same time, we found 19\u00b0 23\u2019 between Mars and Cor Leonis (19\u00b0 20\u00bd corrected), and 21\u00b0 20\u2019 between Mars and the bright star in the wing of Virgo25 (21\u00b0 17\u00bd\u2019 corrected). From these two distances (using the latitudes of the stars and Mars), Mars\u2019s longitude is found to be 13\u00b0 19\u2019 6\u201c Virgo, by consensus of all measurements.\nAlternatively, the meridian altitude of Mars was found at 12h 40m, using two quadrants, to be 50\u00b0 19\u2019, while the tail of Leo26 was 56\u00b0 45\u2019. Therefore, from the declinations and right ascensions of the fixed stars and our distances, Mars\u2019s position is determined as 13\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c Virgo, latitude 4\u00b0 7\u2019 55\u201c ^27. This is the Tychonic procedure. I have included the other for the sake of showing a consensus, and also that it might be evident that despite the lack of absolute perfection in the demonstration, short cuts either in computation or in our understanding can under certain circumstances be applied. For in that previous procedure there is less in the actual work than in the reporting of it. At Prague, 5\u00b0 Scorpio was rising ^28. Therefore, the nonagesimal was about 32\u00bd\u00b0 from the zenith. And since Mars\u2019s distance from the earth was rather more than half the sun\u2019s distance, the resulting parallax of about 5\u2019 opposite 32\u00bd\u00b0 in our parallactic table, shows a latitudinal parallax of 2\u2019 41\u201c. Thus the latitude as seen from the middle of the earth would be 4\u00b0 10\u2154\u2019 north. And because the altitude of the nonagesimal was 57\u00bd\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax at the horizon was 4\u2019 13\u201c. But since Mars was 38\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, the longitudinal parallax corresponding to this position is 2\u2019 36\u201c, and if this be eliminated, Mars would be placed at about 13\u00b0 18\u2019 Virgo ^29. At that moment, the sun\u2019s position was 10\u00b0 16\u2019 42\u201c Pisces. The distance between the bodies was 3\u00b0 1\u2019 18\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 4\u201c, and that of Mars, 24\u2019 5\u201c (for it was 24\u2019 18\u201c at 21\u00b0 Leo in 1585, and 24\u2019 at 26 Virgo in 1587). The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 24\u2019 9\u201c. The true opposition therefore followed 2 days 3 hours 43 minutes later, on 21 February\/3 March before dawn at 2h 13m, Mars being at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 35\u201c Virgo. Forty seconds must be subtracted to reduce the position to the orbit, putting Mars at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 Virgo, with slightly less latitude than before, since the latitude was then decreasing. It was therefore about 4\u00b0 10\u2019, or 4\u00b0 7\u2153\u2019 if the parallax be neglected.\n But because, since Tycho\u2019s death, we have not made frequent observations nor continued them over several days, it would be best, for certainty\u2019s sake, also to make use of those observations which David Fabricius of East Frisia, a sedulous practitioner of astronomy, has communicated to me.\nOn February 16, old style, at 5h in the morning, he took the planet\u2019s distances from the tail of Leo (for the latitude), from the neck of Leo,30 and, on the other hand, from the bright star in the southern wing of Virgo, so as to check its longitude by working it out twice.\nI could make use of Tycho\u2019s line of reasoning, which he routinely adopted in volume I of the Progymnasmata when (as here) the declination of the planet was not known. But because that method extends to ten operations, I prefer for the sake of brevity to proceed as I did before with my own observations. Here there are no hidden dangers.\nFirst, the star in the wing of Virgo, adjusted to our time, is at 4\u00b0 36\u2019 30\u201c Libra with latitude 2\u00b0 50\u2019 north. Fabricius found that Mars is 20\u00b0 18\u2019 westward from it on the zodiac, which puts Mars at about 14\u00b0 18\u2019 30\u201c Virgo. This is a preliminary, approximate figure: the longitude will shortly be corrected. Now the tail of Leo31 is at 16\u00b0 4\u2019 Virgo, with latitude 12\u00b0 18\u2019 North, and Mars was found to be 8\u00b0 17\u2019 distant from the Tail. What is sought is the distance of its parallel from the Tail, since the difference in longitude is 1\u00b0 45\u2019. Dividing the secant of 8\u00b0 17\u2019 by the secant of 1\u00b0 45\u2019 gives the secant of 8\u00b0 6\u2019, the arc sought. This subtracted from the fixed star\u2019s northern latitude of 12\u00b0 18\u2019 leaves Mars\u2019s latitude, 4\u00b0 12\u2019 north. This I now take as determined, and compare it with the latitudes of the fixed stars according to the laws of trigonometry. From the Wing of Virgo, I find Mars\u2019s longitude to be 14\u00b0 19\u2019 Virgo; from the Neck of Leo, 14\u00b0 23\u2019 36\u201c. The mean of these two is 14\u00b0 21\u2019 18\u201c Virgo. And since the sextant gave distances larger than the truth, the latitude would come out at 4\u00b0 14\u2019 north.\nOn the night following February 23, at 12h, he observed Mars in relation to five fixed stars: the Tail of Leo and Arcturus for latitude, and for the longitude, in the first instance, Spica (which followed it), and, in the second, the Neck of Leo and Cor Leonis (which preceded it).\nBy a rough estimate, I foresee that Mars is going to fall at 11\u00bc\u00b0 Virgo. It was found to be 9\u00b0 24\u2019 from the Tail of Leo, and hence, its latitude comes out at 4\u00b0 6\u2019 ^32. And now, through this and the latitudes of the fixed stars, together with their distances (17\u00b0 26\u2019 from Regulus, 17\u00b0 51\u2019 from the Neck of Leo, 37\u00b0 28\u2019 from Spica, 44\u00b0 15\u2019 from Arcturus), Mars\u2019s position comes out at 11\u00b0 21\u2019 23\u201c Virgo (from Regulus), 11\u00b0 20\u2019 52\u201c Virgo (from the Neck of Leo), and 11\u00b0 17\u2019 40\u201c (from Spica). Again (as you see) the distances err in being too great. For from the Heart and the Neck [of Leo], Mars is pushed a little eastward, and from Spica and Arcturus a little westward, and more from Arcturus, owing to its greater northern latitude ^33. The mean (ignoring Arcturus), 11\u00b0 19\u2019 20\u201c Virgo, is very nearly true. Also, the latitude is greater, namely, 4\u00b0 7\u2019 40\u201c north. Now from February 15 at 17h to 23 February at 12h, a period of 7 days 19 hours, Mars moved 3\u00b0 0\u2019: 180 minutes in 187 hours. That is, about one minute per hour. And if you wish to take it into account, the parallax (if any) is subtracted from the longitude on February 16 and a little is added on February 23.\n Because the last observation follows the time of observation found by me by 2 days 21 hours 47 min., add the motion corresponding to this time, 1\u00b0 7\u2019: the position will come out 12\u00b0 26\u2019 Virgo. The agreement is thus very good\u2014it could not be better\u2014given that both of us [that is, Kepler and Fabricius] work independently and do not rely on the facilities used by Tycho Brahe.","1751":"VIII. On 1595 October 30 at 8h 20m, the planet was found at 17\u00b0 47\u2019 15\u201c Taurus,19 not far from the nonagesimal. We may thus be sure of the parallax, although we must take it into account. The latitude was 0\u00b0 5\u2019 10\u201c north. The sun\u2019s position was 16\u00b0 50\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio. The distance between the stars was 56\u2019 45\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 35\u201c; that of Mars, 22\u2019 54\u201c, as appears by comparing the nearby observations. The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 23\u2019 29\u201c. If the distance between the stars be divided by this, it comes out to 40\u2019 47\u201c of a day, or 16 hours 19 min. Therefore, the true opposition was 0h 39m PM on October 31. Mars\u2019s position was 17\u00b0 31\u2019 40\u201c Taurus. This needs no reduction to the orbit, as it is nearly at the node. The latitude was about 0\u00b0 8\u2019 north. But comparison with the preceding and following days shows a latitude of about 5\u2019 north.\nIX. Let, at any rate, Mars\u2019s position on 1597 December 10 at 8h 30m be 3\u00b0 45\u00bd\u2019 Cancer (as above) ^20. The sun\u2019s position was 29\u00b0 4\u2019 53\u201c Sagittarius. The distance between the stars was 4\u00b0 40\u2019 37\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 61\u2019 20\u201c, that of Mars 23\u2019 40\u201c (for in 1580 the diurnal motion in Gemini was 23\u2019, and in 1582, at 17\u00b0 Cancer, it was 24\u2019). Therefore, the sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 25\u2019 0\u201c. These data show that the time of true opposition followed 3 days 7 hours 14 min. later, on December 14 at 3h 44m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 2\u00b0 27\u2153\u2019 Cancer. The reduction to the orbit (quite ridiculous here, since the observation itself has an uncertainty of several minutes) requires the addition of about 52\u201c. Therefore, the corrected position was 2\u00b0 28\u2019 Cancer. The latitude, from the table, was 3\u00b0 33\u2019 north.\nOn the same night, the one following December 10, at 12\u2159h, Fabricius in East Frisia found Mars\u2019s position to be 3\u00b0 40\u00bc\u2019 Cancer with latitude 3\u00b0 23\u2019 N. In this observation the longitude comes out nearly the same. For the motion over 3h 40m is 3\u00bd\u2019, so that in the Brahean observation too, at 12\u2159h Mars could have been at 3\u00b0 42\u2019 Cancer\u2014two minutes beyond the Fabrician position.\nX. On 1600 January 13\/23 at 11h 40m, the time being adjusted to Uraniborg time, the planet was observed at 10\u00b0 38\u2019 46\u201c Leo ^21. The sun\u2019s position was 3\u00b0 26\u2019 30\u201c Aquarius. The stars were 7\u00b0 12\u2019 16\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion for the next few days was 1\u00b0 1\u2019 3\u201c; that of Mars, 23\u2019 44\u201c. The sum: 1\u00b0 24\u2019 47\u201c. The opposition therefore followed 5 days 2h 22m after; that is, on January 19\/29 at 2h 2m in the morning, before dawn. Mars was at 8\u00b0 38\u2019 Leo. There is no need for reduction, since it is near the limit. The latitude, from the table, was 4\u00b0 30\u2019 50\u201c N.\nXI. On the evening of 1602 Febr. 18\/28 at 10h 30m, using the Tychonic  instruments (with the help of the learned Matthias Seiffard,22 bequeathed us by Tycho), I took the distance of Mars from the middle star of the tail of Ursa Major 23 to be 52\u00b0 22\u2019. And since the distance between Cor Leonis and Procyon was 37\u00b0 22\u2019 20\u201c, which should have been 37\u00b0 19\u2019 50\u201c,24 we know that the sextant reads 2\u00bd minutes high. Therefore, the corrected distance of Mars from the tail of Ursa was 52\u00b0 19\u00bd\u2019. And since the latitude of the fixed star is 56\u00b0 22\u2019, the remainder, by subtraction, is 4\u00b0 2\u00bd\u2019\u2014supposing that Mars was at precisely the same longitude as the fixed star. But because there was a difference of 3\u00be degrees between them (as is clear from the following observations), a slight correction is required.\n For let AB be 3\u00b0 43\u2019 30\u201c on a parallel close to the ecliptic, B Mars, C the fixed star, and BC 52\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c. Dividing the secant of BC by the secant of AB gives the  secant of CA, 52\u00b0 14\u2019, which, subtracted from 56\u00b0 22\u2019 (the latitude of the fixed star) leaves 4\u00b0 8\u2019 north as Mars\u2019s observed latitude. At the same time, we found 19\u00b0 23\u2019 between Mars and Cor Leonis (19\u00b0 20\u00bd corrected), and 21\u00b0 20\u2019 between Mars and the bright star in the wing of Virgo25 (21\u00b0 17\u00bd\u2019 corrected). From these two distances (using the latitudes of the stars and Mars), Mars\u2019s longitude is found to be 13\u00b0 19\u2019 6\u201c Virgo, by consensus of all measurements.\nAlternatively, the meridian altitude of Mars was found at 12h 40m, using two quadrants, to be 50\u00b0 19\u2019, while the tail of Leo26 was 56\u00b0 45\u2019. Therefore, from the declinations and right ascensions of the fixed stars and our distances, Mars\u2019s position is determined as 13\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c Virgo, latitude 4\u00b0 7\u2019 55\u201c ^27. This is the Tychonic procedure. I have included the other for the sake of showing a consensus, and also that it might be evident that despite the lack of absolute perfection in the demonstration, short cuts either in computation or in our understanding can under certain circumstances be applied. For in that previous procedure there is less in the actual work than in the reporting of it. At Prague, 5\u00b0 Scorpio was rising ^28. Therefore, the nonagesimal was about 32\u00bd\u00b0 from the zenith. And since Mars\u2019s distance from the earth was rather more than half the sun\u2019s distance, the resulting parallax of about 5\u2019 opposite 32\u00bd\u00b0 in our parallactic table, shows a latitudinal parallax of 2\u2019 41\u201c. Thus the latitude as seen from the middle of the earth would be 4\u00b0 10\u2154\u2019 north. And because the altitude of the nonagesimal was 57\u00bd\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax at the horizon was 4\u2019 13\u201c. But since Mars was 38\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, the longitudinal parallax corresponding to this position is 2\u2019 36\u201c, and if this be eliminated, Mars would be placed at about 13\u00b0 18\u2019 Virgo ^29. At that moment, the sun\u2019s position was 10\u00b0 16\u2019 42\u201c Pisces. The distance between the bodies was 3\u00b0 1\u2019 18\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 4\u201c, and that of Mars, 24\u2019 5\u201c (for it was 24\u2019 18\u201c at 21\u00b0 Leo in 1585, and 24\u2019 at 26 Virgo in 1587). The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 24\u2019 9\u201c. The true opposition therefore followed 2 days 3 hours 43 minutes later, on 21 February\/3 March before dawn at 2h 13m, Mars being at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 35\u201c Virgo. Forty seconds must be subtracted to reduce the position to the orbit, putting Mars at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 Virgo, with slightly less latitude than before, since the latitude was then decreasing. It was therefore about 4\u00b0 10\u2019, or 4\u00b0 7\u2153\u2019 if the parallax be neglected.\n But because, since Tycho\u2019s death, we have not made frequent observations nor continued them over several days, it would be best, for certainty\u2019s sake, also to make use of those observations which David Fabricius of East Frisia, a sedulous practitioner of astronomy, has communicated to me.\nOn February 16, old style, at 5h in the morning, he took the planet\u2019s distances from the tail of Leo (for the latitude), from the neck of Leo,30 and, on the other hand, from the bright star in the southern wing of Virgo, so as to check its longitude by working it out twice.\nI could make use of Tycho\u2019s line of reasoning, which he routinely adopted in volume I of the Progymnasmata when (as here) the declination of the planet was not known. But because that method extends to ten operations, I prefer for the sake of brevity to proceed as I did before with my own observations. Here there are no hidden dangers.\nFirst, the star in the wing of Virgo, adjusted to our time, is at 4\u00b0 36\u2019 30\u201c Libra with latitude 2\u00b0 50\u2019 north. Fabricius found that Mars is 20\u00b0 18\u2019 westward from it on the zodiac, which puts Mars at about 14\u00b0 18\u2019 30\u201c Virgo. This is a preliminary, approximate figure: the longitude will shortly be corrected. Now the tail of Leo31 is at 16\u00b0 4\u2019 Virgo, with latitude 12\u00b0 18\u2019 North, and Mars was found to be 8\u00b0 17\u2019 distant from the Tail. What is sought is the distance of its parallel from the Tail, since the difference in longitude is 1\u00b0 45\u2019. Dividing the secant of 8\u00b0 17\u2019 by the secant of 1\u00b0 45\u2019 gives the secant of 8\u00b0 6\u2019, the arc sought. This subtracted from the fixed star\u2019s northern latitude of 12\u00b0 18\u2019 leaves Mars\u2019s latitude, 4\u00b0 12\u2019 north. This I now take as determined, and compare it with the latitudes of the fixed stars according to the laws of trigonometry. From the Wing of Virgo, I find Mars\u2019s longitude to be 14\u00b0 19\u2019 Virgo; from the Neck of Leo, 14\u00b0 23\u2019 36\u201c. The mean of these two is 14\u00b0 21\u2019 18\u201c Virgo. And since the sextant gave distances larger than the truth, the latitude would come out at 4\u00b0 14\u2019 north.\nOn the night following February 23, at 12h, he observed Mars in relation to five fixed stars: the Tail of Leo and Arcturus for latitude, and for the longitude, in the first instance, Spica (which followed it), and, in the second, the Neck of Leo and Cor Leonis (which preceded it).\nBy a rough estimate, I foresee that Mars is going to fall at 11\u00bc\u00b0 Virgo. It was found to be 9\u00b0 24\u2019 from the Tail of Leo, and hence, its latitude comes out at 4\u00b0 6\u2019 ^32. And now, through this and the latitudes of the fixed stars, together with their distances (17\u00b0 26\u2019 from Regulus, 17\u00b0 51\u2019 from the Neck of Leo, 37\u00b0 28\u2019 from Spica, 44\u00b0 15\u2019 from Arcturus), Mars\u2019s position comes out at 11\u00b0 21\u2019 23\u201c Virgo (from Regulus), 11\u00b0 20\u2019 52\u201c Virgo (from the Neck of Leo), and 11\u00b0 17\u2019 40\u201c (from Spica). Again (as you see) the distances err in being too great. For from the Heart and the Neck [of Leo], Mars is pushed a little eastward, and from Spica and Arcturus a little westward, and more from Arcturus, owing to its greater northern latitude ^33. The mean (ignoring Arcturus), 11\u00b0 19\u2019 20\u201c Virgo, is very nearly true. Also, the latitude is greater, namely, 4\u00b0 7\u2019 40\u201c north. Now from February 15 at 17h to 23 February at 12h, a period of 7 days 19 hours, Mars moved 3\u00b0 0\u2019: 180 minutes in 187 hours. That is, about one minute per hour. And if you wish to take it into account, the parallax (if any) is subtracted from the longitude on February 16 and a little is added on February 23.\n Because the last observation follows the time of observation found by me by 2 days 21 hours 47 min., add the motion corresponding to this time, 1\u00b0 7\u2019: the position will come out 12\u00b0 26\u2019 Virgo. The agreement is thus very good\u2014it could not be better\u2014given that both of us [that is, Kepler and Fabricius] work independently and do not rely on the facilities used by Tycho Brahe.","1752":"VIII. On 1595 October 30 at 8h 20m, the planet was found at 17\u00b0 47\u2019 15\u201c Taurus,19 not far from the nonagesimal. We may thus be sure of the parallax, although we must take it into account. The latitude was 0\u00b0 5\u2019 10\u201c north. The sun\u2019s position was 16\u00b0 50\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio. The distance between the stars was 56\u2019 45\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 35\u201c; that of Mars, 22\u2019 54\u201c, as appears by comparing the nearby observations. The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 23\u2019 29\u201c. If the distance between the stars be divided by this, it comes out to 40\u2019 47\u201c of a day, or 16 hours 19 min. Therefore, the true opposition was 0h 39m PM on October 31. Mars\u2019s position was 17\u00b0 31\u2019 40\u201c Taurus. This needs no reduction to the orbit, as it is nearly at the node. The latitude was about 0\u00b0 8\u2019 north. But comparison with the preceding and following days shows a latitude of about 5\u2019 north.\nIX. Let, at any rate, Mars\u2019s position on 1597 December 10 at 8h 30m be 3\u00b0 45\u00bd\u2019 Cancer (as above) ^20. The sun\u2019s position was 29\u00b0 4\u2019 53\u201c Sagittarius. The distance between the stars was 4\u00b0 40\u2019 37\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 61\u2019 20\u201c, that of Mars 23\u2019 40\u201c (for in 1580 the diurnal motion in Gemini was 23\u2019, and in 1582, at 17\u00b0 Cancer, it was 24\u2019). Therefore, the sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 25\u2019 0\u201c. These data show that the time of true opposition followed 3 days 7 hours 14 min. later, on December 14 at 3h 44m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 2\u00b0 27\u2153\u2019 Cancer. The reduction to the orbit (quite ridiculous here, since the observation itself has an uncertainty of several minutes) requires the addition of about 52\u201c. Therefore, the corrected position was 2\u00b0 28\u2019 Cancer. The latitude, from the table, was 3\u00b0 33\u2019 north.\nOn the same night, the one following December 10, at 12\u2159h, Fabricius in East Frisia found Mars\u2019s position to be 3\u00b0 40\u00bc\u2019 Cancer with latitude 3\u00b0 23\u2019 N. In this observation the longitude comes out nearly the same. For the motion over 3h 40m is 3\u00bd\u2019, so that in the Brahean observation too, at 12\u2159h Mars could have been at 3\u00b0 42\u2019 Cancer\u2014two minutes beyond the Fabrician position.\nX. On 1600 January 13\/23 at 11h 40m, the time being adjusted to Uraniborg time, the planet was observed at 10\u00b0 38\u2019 46\u201c Leo ^21. The sun\u2019s position was 3\u00b0 26\u2019 30\u201c Aquarius. The stars were 7\u00b0 12\u2019 16\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion for the next few days was 1\u00b0 1\u2019 3\u201c; that of Mars, 23\u2019 44\u201c. The sum: 1\u00b0 24\u2019 47\u201c. The opposition therefore followed 5 days 2h 22m after; that is, on January 19\/29 at 2h 2m in the morning, before dawn. Mars was at 8\u00b0 38\u2019 Leo. There is no need for reduction, since it is near the limit. The latitude, from the table, was 4\u00b0 30\u2019 50\u201c N.\nXI. On the evening of 1602 Febr. 18\/28 at 10h 30m, using the Tychonic  instruments (with the help of the learned Matthias Seiffard,22 bequeathed us by Tycho), I took the distance of Mars from the middle star of the tail of Ursa Major 23 to be 52\u00b0 22\u2019. And since the distance between Cor Leonis and Procyon was 37\u00b0 22\u2019 20\u201c, which should have been 37\u00b0 19\u2019 50\u201c,24 we know that the sextant reads 2\u00bd minutes high. Therefore, the corrected distance of Mars from the tail of Ursa was 52\u00b0 19\u00bd\u2019. And since the latitude of the fixed star is 56\u00b0 22\u2019, the remainder, by subtraction, is 4\u00b0 2\u00bd\u2019\u2014supposing that Mars was at precisely the same longitude as the fixed star. But because there was a difference of 3\u00be degrees between them (as is clear from the following observations), a slight correction is required.\n For let AB be 3\u00b0 43\u2019 30\u201c on a parallel close to the ecliptic, B Mars, C the fixed star, and BC 52\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c. Dividing the secant of BC by the secant of AB gives the  secant of CA, 52\u00b0 14\u2019, which, subtracted from 56\u00b0 22\u2019 (the latitude of the fixed star) leaves 4\u00b0 8\u2019 north as Mars\u2019s observed latitude. At the same time, we found 19\u00b0 23\u2019 between Mars and Cor Leonis (19\u00b0 20\u00bd corrected), and 21\u00b0 20\u2019 between Mars and the bright star in the wing of Virgo25 (21\u00b0 17\u00bd\u2019 corrected). From these two distances (using the latitudes of the stars and Mars), Mars\u2019s longitude is found to be 13\u00b0 19\u2019 6\u201c Virgo, by consensus of all measurements.\nAlternatively, the meridian altitude of Mars was found at 12h 40m, using two quadrants, to be 50\u00b0 19\u2019, while the tail of Leo26 was 56\u00b0 45\u2019. Therefore, from the declinations and right ascensions of the fixed stars and our distances, Mars\u2019s position is determined as 13\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c Virgo, latitude 4\u00b0 7\u2019 55\u201c ^27. This is the Tychonic procedure. I have included the other for the sake of showing a consensus, and also that it might be evident that despite the lack of absolute perfection in the demonstration, short cuts either in computation or in our understanding can under certain circumstances be applied. For in that previous procedure there is less in the actual work than in the reporting of it. At Prague, 5\u00b0 Scorpio was rising ^28. Therefore, the nonagesimal was about 32\u00bd\u00b0 from the zenith. And since Mars\u2019s distance from the earth was rather more than half the sun\u2019s distance, the resulting parallax of about 5\u2019 opposite 32\u00bd\u00b0 in our parallactic table, shows a latitudinal parallax of 2\u2019 41\u201c. Thus the latitude as seen from the middle of the earth would be 4\u00b0 10\u2154\u2019 north. And because the altitude of the nonagesimal was 57\u00bd\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax at the horizon was 4\u2019 13\u201c. But since Mars was 38\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, the longitudinal parallax corresponding to this position is 2\u2019 36\u201c, and if this be eliminated, Mars would be placed at about 13\u00b0 18\u2019 Virgo ^29. At that moment, the sun\u2019s position was 10\u00b0 16\u2019 42\u201c Pisces. The distance between the bodies was 3\u00b0 1\u2019 18\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 4\u201c, and that of Mars, 24\u2019 5\u201c (for it was 24\u2019 18\u201c at 21\u00b0 Leo in 1585, and 24\u2019 at 26 Virgo in 1587). The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 24\u2019 9\u201c. The true opposition therefore followed 2 days 3 hours 43 minutes later, on 21 February\/3 March before dawn at 2h 13m, Mars being at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 35\u201c Virgo. Forty seconds must be subtracted to reduce the position to the orbit, putting Mars at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 Virgo, with slightly less latitude than before, since the latitude was then decreasing. It was therefore about 4\u00b0 10\u2019, or 4\u00b0 7\u2153\u2019 if the parallax be neglected.\n But because, since Tycho\u2019s death, we have not made frequent observations nor continued them over several days, it would be best, for certainty\u2019s sake, also to make use of those observations which David Fabricius of East Frisia, a sedulous practitioner of astronomy, has communicated to me.\nOn February 16, old style, at 5h in the morning, he took the planet\u2019s distances from the tail of Leo (for the latitude), from the neck of Leo,30 and, on the other hand, from the bright star in the southern wing of Virgo, so as to check its longitude by working it out twice.\nI could make use of Tycho\u2019s line of reasoning, which he routinely adopted in volume I of the Progymnasmata when (as here) the declination of the planet was not known. But because that method extends to ten operations, I prefer for the sake of brevity to proceed as I did before with my own observations. Here there are no hidden dangers.\nFirst, the star in the wing of Virgo, adjusted to our time, is at 4\u00b0 36\u2019 30\u201c Libra with latitude 2\u00b0 50\u2019 north. Fabricius found that Mars is 20\u00b0 18\u2019 westward from it on the zodiac, which puts Mars at about 14\u00b0 18\u2019 30\u201c Virgo. This is a preliminary, approximate figure: the longitude will shortly be corrected. Now the tail of Leo31 is at 16\u00b0 4\u2019 Virgo, with latitude 12\u00b0 18\u2019 North, and Mars was found to be 8\u00b0 17\u2019 distant from the Tail. What is sought is the distance of its parallel from the Tail, since the difference in longitude is 1\u00b0 45\u2019. Dividing the secant of 8\u00b0 17\u2019 by the secant of 1\u00b0 45\u2019 gives the secant of 8\u00b0 6\u2019, the arc sought. This subtracted from the fixed star\u2019s northern latitude of 12\u00b0 18\u2019 leaves Mars\u2019s latitude, 4\u00b0 12\u2019 north. This I now take as determined, and compare it with the latitudes of the fixed stars according to the laws of trigonometry. From the Wing of Virgo, I find Mars\u2019s longitude to be 14\u00b0 19\u2019 Virgo; from the Neck of Leo, 14\u00b0 23\u2019 36\u201c. The mean of these two is 14\u00b0 21\u2019 18\u201c Virgo. And since the sextant gave distances larger than the truth, the latitude would come out at 4\u00b0 14\u2019 north.\nOn the night following February 23, at 12h, he observed Mars in relation to five fixed stars: the Tail of Leo and Arcturus for latitude, and for the longitude, in the first instance, Spica (which followed it), and, in the second, the Neck of Leo and Cor Leonis (which preceded it).\nBy a rough estimate, I foresee that Mars is going to fall at 11\u00bc\u00b0 Virgo. It was found to be 9\u00b0 24\u2019 from the Tail of Leo, and hence, its latitude comes out at 4\u00b0 6\u2019 ^32. And now, through this and the latitudes of the fixed stars, together with their distances (17\u00b0 26\u2019 from Regulus, 17\u00b0 51\u2019 from the Neck of Leo, 37\u00b0 28\u2019 from Spica, 44\u00b0 15\u2019 from Arcturus), Mars\u2019s position comes out at 11\u00b0 21\u2019 23\u201c Virgo (from Regulus), 11\u00b0 20\u2019 52\u201c Virgo (from the Neck of Leo), and 11\u00b0 17\u2019 40\u201c (from Spica). Again (as you see) the distances err in being too great. For from the Heart and the Neck [of Leo], Mars is pushed a little eastward, and from Spica and Arcturus a little westward, and more from Arcturus, owing to its greater northern latitude ^33. The mean (ignoring Arcturus), 11\u00b0 19\u2019 20\u201c Virgo, is very nearly true. Also, the latitude is greater, namely, 4\u00b0 7\u2019 40\u201c north. Now from February 15 at 17h to 23 February at 12h, a period of 7 days 19 hours, Mars moved 3\u00b0 0\u2019: 180 minutes in 187 hours. That is, about one minute per hour. And if you wish to take it into account, the parallax (if any) is subtracted from the longitude on February 16 and a little is added on February 23.\n Because the last observation follows the time of observation found by me by 2 days 21 hours 47 min., add the motion corresponding to this time, 1\u00b0 7\u2019: the position will come out 12\u00b0 26\u2019 Virgo. The agreement is thus very good\u2014it could not be better\u2014given that both of us [that is, Kepler and Fabricius] work independently and do not rely on the facilities used by Tycho Brahe.","1753":"VIII. On 1595 October 30 at 8h 20m, the planet was found at 17\u00b0 47\u2019 15\u201c Taurus,19 not far from the nonagesimal. We may thus be sure of the parallax, although we must take it into account. The latitude was 0\u00b0 5\u2019 10\u201c north. The sun\u2019s position was 16\u00b0 50\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio. The distance between the stars was 56\u2019 45\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 35\u201c; that of Mars, 22\u2019 54\u201c, as appears by comparing the nearby observations. The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 23\u2019 29\u201c. If the distance between the stars be divided by this, it comes out to 40\u2019 47\u201c of a day, or 16 hours 19 min. Therefore, the true opposition was 0h 39m PM on October 31. Mars\u2019s position was 17\u00b0 31\u2019 40\u201c Taurus. This needs no reduction to the orbit, as it is nearly at the node. The latitude was about 0\u00b0 8\u2019 north. But comparison with the preceding and following days shows a latitude of about 5\u2019 north.\nIX. Let, at any rate, Mars\u2019s position on 1597 December 10 at 8h 30m be 3\u00b0 45\u00bd\u2019 Cancer (as above) ^20. The sun\u2019s position was 29\u00b0 4\u2019 53\u201c Sagittarius. The distance between the stars was 4\u00b0 40\u2019 37\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 61\u2019 20\u201c, that of Mars 23\u2019 40\u201c (for in 1580 the diurnal motion in Gemini was 23\u2019, and in 1582, at 17\u00b0 Cancer, it was 24\u2019). Therefore, the sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 25\u2019 0\u201c. These data show that the time of true opposition followed 3 days 7 hours 14 min. later, on December 14 at 3h 44m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 2\u00b0 27\u2153\u2019 Cancer. The reduction to the orbit (quite ridiculous here, since the observation itself has an uncertainty of several minutes) requires the addition of about 52\u201c. Therefore, the corrected position was 2\u00b0 28\u2019 Cancer. The latitude, from the table, was 3\u00b0 33\u2019 north.\nOn the same night, the one following December 10, at 12\u2159h, Fabricius in East Frisia found Mars\u2019s position to be 3\u00b0 40\u00bc\u2019 Cancer with latitude 3\u00b0 23\u2019 N. In this observation the longitude comes out nearly the same. For the motion over 3h 40m is 3\u00bd\u2019, so that in the Brahean observation too, at 12\u2159h Mars could have been at 3\u00b0 42\u2019 Cancer\u2014two minutes beyond the Fabrician position.\nX. On 1600 January 13\/23 at 11h 40m, the time being adjusted to Uraniborg time, the planet was observed at 10\u00b0 38\u2019 46\u201c Leo ^21. The sun\u2019s position was 3\u00b0 26\u2019 30\u201c Aquarius. The stars were 7\u00b0 12\u2019 16\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion for the next few days was 1\u00b0 1\u2019 3\u201c; that of Mars, 23\u2019 44\u201c. The sum: 1\u00b0 24\u2019 47\u201c. The opposition therefore followed 5 days 2h 22m after; that is, on January 19\/29 at 2h 2m in the morning, before dawn. Mars was at 8\u00b0 38\u2019 Leo. There is no need for reduction, since it is near the limit. The latitude, from the table, was 4\u00b0 30\u2019 50\u201c N.\nXI. On the evening of 1602 Febr. 18\/28 at 10h 30m, using the Tychonic  instruments (with the help of the learned Matthias Seiffard,22 bequeathed us by Tycho), I took the distance of Mars from the middle star of the tail of Ursa Major 23 to be 52\u00b0 22\u2019. And since the distance between Cor Leonis and Procyon was 37\u00b0 22\u2019 20\u201c, which should have been 37\u00b0 19\u2019 50\u201c,24 we know that the sextant reads 2\u00bd minutes high. Therefore, the corrected distance of Mars from the tail of Ursa was 52\u00b0 19\u00bd\u2019. And since the latitude of the fixed star is 56\u00b0 22\u2019, the remainder, by subtraction, is 4\u00b0 2\u00bd\u2019\u2014supposing that Mars was at precisely the same longitude as the fixed star. But because there was a difference of 3\u00be degrees between them (as is clear from the following observations), a slight correction is required.\n For let AB be 3\u00b0 43\u2019 30\u201c on a parallel close to the ecliptic, B Mars, C the fixed star, and BC 52\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c. Dividing the secant of BC by the secant of AB gives the  secant of CA, 52\u00b0 14\u2019, which, subtracted from 56\u00b0 22\u2019 (the latitude of the fixed star) leaves 4\u00b0 8\u2019 north as Mars\u2019s observed latitude. At the same time, we found 19\u00b0 23\u2019 between Mars and Cor Leonis (19\u00b0 20\u00bd corrected), and 21\u00b0 20\u2019 between Mars and the bright star in the wing of Virgo25 (21\u00b0 17\u00bd\u2019 corrected). From these two distances (using the latitudes of the stars and Mars), Mars\u2019s longitude is found to be 13\u00b0 19\u2019 6\u201c Virgo, by consensus of all measurements.\nAlternatively, the meridian altitude of Mars was found at 12h 40m, using two quadrants, to be 50\u00b0 19\u2019, while the tail of Leo26 was 56\u00b0 45\u2019. Therefore, from the declinations and right ascensions of the fixed stars and our distances, Mars\u2019s position is determined as 13\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c Virgo, latitude 4\u00b0 7\u2019 55\u201c ^27. This is the Tychonic procedure. I have included the other for the sake of showing a consensus, and also that it might be evident that despite the lack of absolute perfection in the demonstration, short cuts either in computation or in our understanding can under certain circumstances be applied. For in that previous procedure there is less in the actual work than in the reporting of it. At Prague, 5\u00b0 Scorpio was rising ^28. Therefore, the nonagesimal was about 32\u00bd\u00b0 from the zenith. And since Mars\u2019s distance from the earth was rather more than half the sun\u2019s distance, the resulting parallax of about 5\u2019 opposite 32\u00bd\u00b0 in our parallactic table, shows a latitudinal parallax of 2\u2019 41\u201c. Thus the latitude as seen from the middle of the earth would be 4\u00b0 10\u2154\u2019 north. And because the altitude of the nonagesimal was 57\u00bd\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax at the horizon was 4\u2019 13\u201c. But since Mars was 38\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, the longitudinal parallax corresponding to this position is 2\u2019 36\u201c, and if this be eliminated, Mars would be placed at about 13\u00b0 18\u2019 Virgo ^29. At that moment, the sun\u2019s position was 10\u00b0 16\u2019 42\u201c Pisces. The distance between the bodies was 3\u00b0 1\u2019 18\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 4\u201c, and that of Mars, 24\u2019 5\u201c (for it was 24\u2019 18\u201c at 21\u00b0 Leo in 1585, and 24\u2019 at 26 Virgo in 1587). The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 24\u2019 9\u201c. The true opposition therefore followed 2 days 3 hours 43 minutes later, on 21 February\/3 March before dawn at 2h 13m, Mars being at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 35\u201c Virgo. Forty seconds must be subtracted to reduce the position to the orbit, putting Mars at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 Virgo, with slightly less latitude than before, since the latitude was then decreasing. It was therefore about 4\u00b0 10\u2019, or 4\u00b0 7\u2153\u2019 if the parallax be neglected.\n But because, since Tycho\u2019s death, we have not made frequent observations nor continued them over several days, it would be best, for certainty\u2019s sake, also to make use of those observations which David Fabricius of East Frisia, a sedulous practitioner of astronomy, has communicated to me.\nOn February 16, old style, at 5h in the morning, he took the planet\u2019s distances from the tail of Leo (for the latitude), from the neck of Leo,30 and, on the other hand, from the bright star in the southern wing of Virgo, so as to check its longitude by working it out twice.\nI could make use of Tycho\u2019s line of reasoning, which he routinely adopted in volume I of the Progymnasmata when (as here) the declination of the planet was not known. But because that method extends to ten operations, I prefer for the sake of brevity to proceed as I did before with my own observations. Here there are no hidden dangers.\nFirst, the star in the wing of Virgo, adjusted to our time, is at 4\u00b0 36\u2019 30\u201c Libra with latitude 2\u00b0 50\u2019 north. Fabricius found that Mars is 20\u00b0 18\u2019 westward from it on the zodiac, which puts Mars at about 14\u00b0 18\u2019 30\u201c Virgo. This is a preliminary, approximate figure: the longitude will shortly be corrected. Now the tail of Leo31 is at 16\u00b0 4\u2019 Virgo, with latitude 12\u00b0 18\u2019 North, and Mars was found to be 8\u00b0 17\u2019 distant from the Tail. What is sought is the distance of its parallel from the Tail, since the difference in longitude is 1\u00b0 45\u2019. Dividing the secant of 8\u00b0 17\u2019 by the secant of 1\u00b0 45\u2019 gives the secant of 8\u00b0 6\u2019, the arc sought. This subtracted from the fixed star\u2019s northern latitude of 12\u00b0 18\u2019 leaves Mars\u2019s latitude, 4\u00b0 12\u2019 north. This I now take as determined, and compare it with the latitudes of the fixed stars according to the laws of trigonometry. From the Wing of Virgo, I find Mars\u2019s longitude to be 14\u00b0 19\u2019 Virgo; from the Neck of Leo, 14\u00b0 23\u2019 36\u201c. The mean of these two is 14\u00b0 21\u2019 18\u201c Virgo. And since the sextant gave distances larger than the truth, the latitude would come out at 4\u00b0 14\u2019 north.\nOn the night following February 23, at 12h, he observed Mars in relation to five fixed stars: the Tail of Leo and Arcturus for latitude, and for the longitude, in the first instance, Spica (which followed it), and, in the second, the Neck of Leo and Cor Leonis (which preceded it).\nBy a rough estimate, I foresee that Mars is going to fall at 11\u00bc\u00b0 Virgo. It was found to be 9\u00b0 24\u2019 from the Tail of Leo, and hence, its latitude comes out at 4\u00b0 6\u2019 ^32. And now, through this and the latitudes of the fixed stars, together with their distances (17\u00b0 26\u2019 from Regulus, 17\u00b0 51\u2019 from the Neck of Leo, 37\u00b0 28\u2019 from Spica, 44\u00b0 15\u2019 from Arcturus), Mars\u2019s position comes out at 11\u00b0 21\u2019 23\u201c Virgo (from Regulus), 11\u00b0 20\u2019 52\u201c Virgo (from the Neck of Leo), and 11\u00b0 17\u2019 40\u201c (from Spica). Again (as you see) the distances err in being too great. For from the Heart and the Neck [of Leo], Mars is pushed a little eastward, and from Spica and Arcturus a little westward, and more from Arcturus, owing to its greater northern latitude ^33. The mean (ignoring Arcturus), 11\u00b0 19\u2019 20\u201c Virgo, is very nearly true. Also, the latitude is greater, namely, 4\u00b0 7\u2019 40\u201c north. Now from February 15 at 17h to 23 February at 12h, a period of 7 days 19 hours, Mars moved 3\u00b0 0\u2019: 180 minutes in 187 hours. That is, about one minute per hour. And if you wish to take it into account, the parallax (if any) is subtracted from the longitude on February 16 and a little is added on February 23.\n Because the last observation follows the time of observation found by me by 2 days 21 hours 47 min., add the motion corresponding to this time, 1\u00b0 7\u2019: the position will come out 12\u00b0 26\u2019 Virgo. The agreement is thus very good\u2014it could not be better\u2014given that both of us [that is, Kepler and Fabricius] work independently and do not rely on the facilities used by Tycho Brahe.","1754":"VIII. On 1595 October 30 at 8h 20m, the planet was found at 17\u00b0 47\u2019 15\u201c Taurus,19 not far from the nonagesimal. We may thus be sure of the parallax, although we must take it into account. The latitude was 0\u00b0 5\u2019 10\u201c north. The sun\u2019s position was 16\u00b0 50\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio. The distance between the stars was 56\u2019 45\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 35\u201c; that of Mars, 22\u2019 54\u201c, as appears by comparing the nearby observations. The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 23\u2019 29\u201c. If the distance between the stars be divided by this, it comes out to 40\u2019 47\u201c of a day, or 16 hours 19 min. Therefore, the true opposition was 0h 39m PM on October 31. Mars\u2019s position was 17\u00b0 31\u2019 40\u201c Taurus. This needs no reduction to the orbit, as it is nearly at the node. The latitude was about 0\u00b0 8\u2019 north. But comparison with the preceding and following days shows a latitude of about 5\u2019 north.\nIX. Let, at any rate, Mars\u2019s position on 1597 December 10 at 8h 30m be 3\u00b0 45\u00bd\u2019 Cancer (as above) ^20. The sun\u2019s position was 29\u00b0 4\u2019 53\u201c Sagittarius. The distance between the stars was 4\u00b0 40\u2019 37\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 61\u2019 20\u201c, that of Mars 23\u2019 40\u201c (for in 1580 the diurnal motion in Gemini was 23\u2019, and in 1582, at 17\u00b0 Cancer, it was 24\u2019). Therefore, the sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 25\u2019 0\u201c. These data show that the time of true opposition followed 3 days 7 hours 14 min. later, on December 14 at 3h 44m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 2\u00b0 27\u2153\u2019 Cancer. The reduction to the orbit (quite ridiculous here, since the observation itself has an uncertainty of several minutes) requires the addition of about 52\u201c. Therefore, the corrected position was 2\u00b0 28\u2019 Cancer. The latitude, from the table, was 3\u00b0 33\u2019 north.\nOn the same night, the one following December 10, at 12\u2159h, Fabricius in East Frisia found Mars\u2019s position to be 3\u00b0 40\u00bc\u2019 Cancer with latitude 3\u00b0 23\u2019 N. In this observation the longitude comes out nearly the same. For the motion over 3h 40m is 3\u00bd\u2019, so that in the Brahean observation too, at 12\u2159h Mars could have been at 3\u00b0 42\u2019 Cancer\u2014two minutes beyond the Fabrician position.\nX. On 1600 January 13\/23 at 11h 40m, the time being adjusted to Uraniborg time, the planet was observed at 10\u00b0 38\u2019 46\u201c Leo ^21. The sun\u2019s position was 3\u00b0 26\u2019 30\u201c Aquarius. The stars were 7\u00b0 12\u2019 16\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion for the next few days was 1\u00b0 1\u2019 3\u201c; that of Mars, 23\u2019 44\u201c. The sum: 1\u00b0 24\u2019 47\u201c. The opposition therefore followed 5 days 2h 22m after; that is, on January 19\/29 at 2h 2m in the morning, before dawn. Mars was at 8\u00b0 38\u2019 Leo. There is no need for reduction, since it is near the limit. The latitude, from the table, was 4\u00b0 30\u2019 50\u201c N.\nXI. On the evening of 1602 Febr. 18\/28 at 10h 30m, using the Tychonic  instruments (with the help of the learned Matthias Seiffard,22 bequeathed us by Tycho), I took the distance of Mars from the middle star of the tail of Ursa Major 23 to be 52\u00b0 22\u2019. And since the distance between Cor Leonis and Procyon was 37\u00b0 22\u2019 20\u201c, which should have been 37\u00b0 19\u2019 50\u201c,24 we know that the sextant reads 2\u00bd minutes high. Therefore, the corrected distance of Mars from the tail of Ursa was 52\u00b0 19\u00bd\u2019. And since the latitude of the fixed star is 56\u00b0 22\u2019, the remainder, by subtraction, is 4\u00b0 2\u00bd\u2019\u2014supposing that Mars was at precisely the same longitude as the fixed star. But because there was a difference of 3\u00be degrees between them (as is clear from the following observations), a slight correction is required.\n For let AB be 3\u00b0 43\u2019 30\u201c on a parallel close to the ecliptic, B Mars, C the fixed star, and BC 52\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c. Dividing the secant of BC by the secant of AB gives the  secant of CA, 52\u00b0 14\u2019, which, subtracted from 56\u00b0 22\u2019 (the latitude of the fixed star) leaves 4\u00b0 8\u2019 north as Mars\u2019s observed latitude. At the same time, we found 19\u00b0 23\u2019 between Mars and Cor Leonis (19\u00b0 20\u00bd corrected), and 21\u00b0 20\u2019 between Mars and the bright star in the wing of Virgo25 (21\u00b0 17\u00bd\u2019 corrected). From these two distances (using the latitudes of the stars and Mars), Mars\u2019s longitude is found to be 13\u00b0 19\u2019 6\u201c Virgo, by consensus of all measurements.\nAlternatively, the meridian altitude of Mars was found at 12h 40m, using two quadrants, to be 50\u00b0 19\u2019, while the tail of Leo26 was 56\u00b0 45\u2019. Therefore, from the declinations and right ascensions of the fixed stars and our distances, Mars\u2019s position is determined as 13\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c Virgo, latitude 4\u00b0 7\u2019 55\u201c ^27. This is the Tychonic procedure. I have included the other for the sake of showing a consensus, and also that it might be evident that despite the lack of absolute perfection in the demonstration, short cuts either in computation or in our understanding can under certain circumstances be applied. For in that previous procedure there is less in the actual work than in the reporting of it. At Prague, 5\u00b0 Scorpio was rising ^28. Therefore, the nonagesimal was about 32\u00bd\u00b0 from the zenith. And since Mars\u2019s distance from the earth was rather more than half the sun\u2019s distance, the resulting parallax of about 5\u2019 opposite 32\u00bd\u00b0 in our parallactic table, shows a latitudinal parallax of 2\u2019 41\u201c. Thus the latitude as seen from the middle of the earth would be 4\u00b0 10\u2154\u2019 north. And because the altitude of the nonagesimal was 57\u00bd\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax at the horizon was 4\u2019 13\u201c. But since Mars was 38\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, the longitudinal parallax corresponding to this position is 2\u2019 36\u201c, and if this be eliminated, Mars would be placed at about 13\u00b0 18\u2019 Virgo ^29. At that moment, the sun\u2019s position was 10\u00b0 16\u2019 42\u201c Pisces. The distance between the bodies was 3\u00b0 1\u2019 18\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 4\u201c, and that of Mars, 24\u2019 5\u201c (for it was 24\u2019 18\u201c at 21\u00b0 Leo in 1585, and 24\u2019 at 26 Virgo in 1587). The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 24\u2019 9\u201c. The true opposition therefore followed 2 days 3 hours 43 minutes later, on 21 February\/3 March before dawn at 2h 13m, Mars being at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 35\u201c Virgo. Forty seconds must be subtracted to reduce the position to the orbit, putting Mars at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 Virgo, with slightly less latitude than before, since the latitude was then decreasing. It was therefore about 4\u00b0 10\u2019, or 4\u00b0 7\u2153\u2019 if the parallax be neglected.\n But because, since Tycho\u2019s death, we have not made frequent observations nor continued them over several days, it would be best, for certainty\u2019s sake, also to make use of those observations which David Fabricius of East Frisia, a sedulous practitioner of astronomy, has communicated to me.\nOn February 16, old style, at 5h in the morning, he took the planet\u2019s distances from the tail of Leo (for the latitude), from the neck of Leo,30 and, on the other hand, from the bright star in the southern wing of Virgo, so as to check its longitude by working it out twice.\nI could make use of Tycho\u2019s line of reasoning, which he routinely adopted in volume I of the Progymnasmata when (as here) the declination of the planet was not known. But because that method extends to ten operations, I prefer for the sake of brevity to proceed as I did before with my own observations. Here there are no hidden dangers.\nFirst, the star in the wing of Virgo, adjusted to our time, is at 4\u00b0 36\u2019 30\u201c Libra with latitude 2\u00b0 50\u2019 north. Fabricius found that Mars is 20\u00b0 18\u2019 westward from it on the zodiac, which puts Mars at about 14\u00b0 18\u2019 30\u201c Virgo. This is a preliminary, approximate figure: the longitude will shortly be corrected. Now the tail of Leo31 is at 16\u00b0 4\u2019 Virgo, with latitude 12\u00b0 18\u2019 North, and Mars was found to be 8\u00b0 17\u2019 distant from the Tail. What is sought is the distance of its parallel from the Tail, since the difference in longitude is 1\u00b0 45\u2019. Dividing the secant of 8\u00b0 17\u2019 by the secant of 1\u00b0 45\u2019 gives the secant of 8\u00b0 6\u2019, the arc sought. This subtracted from the fixed star\u2019s northern latitude of 12\u00b0 18\u2019 leaves Mars\u2019s latitude, 4\u00b0 12\u2019 north. This I now take as determined, and compare it with the latitudes of the fixed stars according to the laws of trigonometry. From the Wing of Virgo, I find Mars\u2019s longitude to be 14\u00b0 19\u2019 Virgo; from the Neck of Leo, 14\u00b0 23\u2019 36\u201c. The mean of these two is 14\u00b0 21\u2019 18\u201c Virgo. And since the sextant gave distances larger than the truth, the latitude would come out at 4\u00b0 14\u2019 north.\nOn the night following February 23, at 12h, he observed Mars in relation to five fixed stars: the Tail of Leo and Arcturus for latitude, and for the longitude, in the first instance, Spica (which followed it), and, in the second, the Neck of Leo and Cor Leonis (which preceded it).\nBy a rough estimate, I foresee that Mars is going to fall at 11\u00bc\u00b0 Virgo. It was found to be 9\u00b0 24\u2019 from the Tail of Leo, and hence, its latitude comes out at 4\u00b0 6\u2019 ^32. And now, through this and the latitudes of the fixed stars, together with their distances (17\u00b0 26\u2019 from Regulus, 17\u00b0 51\u2019 from the Neck of Leo, 37\u00b0 28\u2019 from Spica, 44\u00b0 15\u2019 from Arcturus), Mars\u2019s position comes out at 11\u00b0 21\u2019 23\u201c Virgo (from Regulus), 11\u00b0 20\u2019 52\u201c Virgo (from the Neck of Leo), and 11\u00b0 17\u2019 40\u201c (from Spica). Again (as you see) the distances err in being too great. For from the Heart and the Neck [of Leo], Mars is pushed a little eastward, and from Spica and Arcturus a little westward, and more from Arcturus, owing to its greater northern latitude ^33. The mean (ignoring Arcturus), 11\u00b0 19\u2019 20\u201c Virgo, is very nearly true. Also, the latitude is greater, namely, 4\u00b0 7\u2019 40\u201c north. Now from February 15 at 17h to 23 February at 12h, a period of 7 days 19 hours, Mars moved 3\u00b0 0\u2019: 180 minutes in 187 hours. That is, about one minute per hour. And if you wish to take it into account, the parallax (if any) is subtracted from the longitude on February 16 and a little is added on February 23.\n Because the last observation follows the time of observation found by me by 2 days 21 hours 47 min., add the motion corresponding to this time, 1\u00b0 7\u2019: the position will come out 12\u00b0 26\u2019 Virgo. The agreement is thus very good\u2014it could not be better\u2014given that both of us [that is, Kepler and Fabricius] work independently and do not rely on the facilities used by Tycho Brahe.","1755":"VIII. On 1595 October 30 at 8h 20m, the planet was found at 17\u00b0 47\u2019 15\u201c Taurus,19 not far from the nonagesimal. We may thus be sure of the parallax, although we must take it into account. The latitude was 0\u00b0 5\u2019 10\u201c north. The sun\u2019s position was 16\u00b0 50\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio. The distance between the stars was 56\u2019 45\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 35\u201c; that of Mars, 22\u2019 54\u201c, as appears by comparing the nearby observations. The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 23\u2019 29\u201c. If the distance between the stars be divided by this, it comes out to 40\u2019 47\u201c of a day, or 16 hours 19 min. Therefore, the true opposition was 0h 39m PM on October 31. Mars\u2019s position was 17\u00b0 31\u2019 40\u201c Taurus. This needs no reduction to the orbit, as it is nearly at the node. The latitude was about 0\u00b0 8\u2019 north. But comparison with the preceding and following days shows a latitude of about 5\u2019 north.\nIX. Let, at any rate, Mars\u2019s position on 1597 December 10 at 8h 30m be 3\u00b0 45\u00bd\u2019 Cancer (as above) ^20. The sun\u2019s position was 29\u00b0 4\u2019 53\u201c Sagittarius. The distance between the stars was 4\u00b0 40\u2019 37\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 61\u2019 20\u201c, that of Mars 23\u2019 40\u201c (for in 1580 the diurnal motion in Gemini was 23\u2019, and in 1582, at 17\u00b0 Cancer, it was 24\u2019). Therefore, the sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 25\u2019 0\u201c. These data show that the time of true opposition followed 3 days 7 hours 14 min. later, on December 14 at 3h 44m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 2\u00b0 27\u2153\u2019 Cancer. The reduction to the orbit (quite ridiculous here, since the observation itself has an uncertainty of several minutes) requires the addition of about 52\u201c. Therefore, the corrected position was 2\u00b0 28\u2019 Cancer. The latitude, from the table, was 3\u00b0 33\u2019 north.\nOn the same night, the one following December 10, at 12\u2159h, Fabricius in East Frisia found Mars\u2019s position to be 3\u00b0 40\u00bc\u2019 Cancer with latitude 3\u00b0 23\u2019 N. In this observation the longitude comes out nearly the same. For the motion over 3h 40m is 3\u00bd\u2019, so that in the Brahean observation too, at 12\u2159h Mars could have been at 3\u00b0 42\u2019 Cancer\u2014two minutes beyond the Fabrician position.\nX. On 1600 January 13\/23 at 11h 40m, the time being adjusted to Uraniborg time, the planet was observed at 10\u00b0 38\u2019 46\u201c Leo ^21. The sun\u2019s position was 3\u00b0 26\u2019 30\u201c Aquarius. The stars were 7\u00b0 12\u2019 16\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion for the next few days was 1\u00b0 1\u2019 3\u201c; that of Mars, 23\u2019 44\u201c. The sum: 1\u00b0 24\u2019 47\u201c. The opposition therefore followed 5 days 2h 22m after; that is, on January 19\/29 at 2h 2m in the morning, before dawn. Mars was at 8\u00b0 38\u2019 Leo. There is no need for reduction, since it is near the limit. The latitude, from the table, was 4\u00b0 30\u2019 50\u201c N.\nXI. On the evening of 1602 Febr. 18\/28 at 10h 30m, using the Tychonic  instruments (with the help of the learned Matthias Seiffard,22 bequeathed us by Tycho), I took the distance of Mars from the middle star of the tail of Ursa Major 23 to be 52\u00b0 22\u2019. And since the distance between Cor Leonis and Procyon was 37\u00b0 22\u2019 20\u201c, which should have been 37\u00b0 19\u2019 50\u201c,24 we know that the sextant reads 2\u00bd minutes high. Therefore, the corrected distance of Mars from the tail of Ursa was 52\u00b0 19\u00bd\u2019. And since the latitude of the fixed star is 56\u00b0 22\u2019, the remainder, by subtraction, is 4\u00b0 2\u00bd\u2019\u2014supposing that Mars was at precisely the same longitude as the fixed star. But because there was a difference of 3\u00be degrees between them (as is clear from the following observations), a slight correction is required.\n For let AB be 3\u00b0 43\u2019 30\u201c on a parallel close to the ecliptic, B Mars, C the fixed star, and BC 52\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c. Dividing the secant of BC by the secant of AB gives the  secant of CA, 52\u00b0 14\u2019, which, subtracted from 56\u00b0 22\u2019 (the latitude of the fixed star) leaves 4\u00b0 8\u2019 north as Mars\u2019s observed latitude. At the same time, we found 19\u00b0 23\u2019 between Mars and Cor Leonis (19\u00b0 20\u00bd corrected), and 21\u00b0 20\u2019 between Mars and the bright star in the wing of Virgo25 (21\u00b0 17\u00bd\u2019 corrected). From these two distances (using the latitudes of the stars and Mars), Mars\u2019s longitude is found to be 13\u00b0 19\u2019 6\u201c Virgo, by consensus of all measurements.\nAlternatively, the meridian altitude of Mars was found at 12h 40m, using two quadrants, to be 50\u00b0 19\u2019, while the tail of Leo26 was 56\u00b0 45\u2019. Therefore, from the declinations and right ascensions of the fixed stars and our distances, Mars\u2019s position is determined as 13\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c Virgo, latitude 4\u00b0 7\u2019 55\u201c ^27. This is the Tychonic procedure. I have included the other for the sake of showing a consensus, and also that it might be evident that despite the lack of absolute perfection in the demonstration, short cuts either in computation or in our understanding can under certain circumstances be applied. For in that previous procedure there is less in the actual work than in the reporting of it. At Prague, 5\u00b0 Scorpio was rising ^28. Therefore, the nonagesimal was about 32\u00bd\u00b0 from the zenith. And since Mars\u2019s distance from the earth was rather more than half the sun\u2019s distance, the resulting parallax of about 5\u2019 opposite 32\u00bd\u00b0 in our parallactic table, shows a latitudinal parallax of 2\u2019 41\u201c. Thus the latitude as seen from the middle of the earth would be 4\u00b0 10\u2154\u2019 north. And because the altitude of the nonagesimal was 57\u00bd\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax at the horizon was 4\u2019 13\u201c. But since Mars was 38\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, the longitudinal parallax corresponding to this position is 2\u2019 36\u201c, and if this be eliminated, Mars would be placed at about 13\u00b0 18\u2019 Virgo ^29. At that moment, the sun\u2019s position was 10\u00b0 16\u2019 42\u201c Pisces. The distance between the bodies was 3\u00b0 1\u2019 18\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 4\u201c, and that of Mars, 24\u2019 5\u201c (for it was 24\u2019 18\u201c at 21\u00b0 Leo in 1585, and 24\u2019 at 26 Virgo in 1587). The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 24\u2019 9\u201c. The true opposition therefore followed 2 days 3 hours 43 minutes later, on 21 February\/3 March before dawn at 2h 13m, Mars being at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 35\u201c Virgo. Forty seconds must be subtracted to reduce the position to the orbit, putting Mars at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 Virgo, with slightly less latitude than before, since the latitude was then decreasing. It was therefore about 4\u00b0 10\u2019, or 4\u00b0 7\u2153\u2019 if the parallax be neglected.\n But because, since Tycho\u2019s death, we have not made frequent observations nor continued them over several days, it would be best, for certainty\u2019s sake, also to make use of those observations which David Fabricius of East Frisia, a sedulous practitioner of astronomy, has communicated to me.\nOn February 16, old style, at 5h in the morning, he took the planet\u2019s distances from the tail of Leo (for the latitude), from the neck of Leo,30 and, on the other hand, from the bright star in the southern wing of Virgo, so as to check its longitude by working it out twice.\nI could make use of Tycho\u2019s line of reasoning, which he routinely adopted in volume I of the Progymnasmata when (as here) the declination of the planet was not known. But because that method extends to ten operations, I prefer for the sake of brevity to proceed as I did before with my own observations. Here there are no hidden dangers.\nFirst, the star in the wing of Virgo, adjusted to our time, is at 4\u00b0 36\u2019 30\u201c Libra with latitude 2\u00b0 50\u2019 north. Fabricius found that Mars is 20\u00b0 18\u2019 westward from it on the zodiac, which puts Mars at about 14\u00b0 18\u2019 30\u201c Virgo. This is a preliminary, approximate figure: the longitude will shortly be corrected. Now the tail of Leo31 is at 16\u00b0 4\u2019 Virgo, with latitude 12\u00b0 18\u2019 North, and Mars was found to be 8\u00b0 17\u2019 distant from the Tail. What is sought is the distance of its parallel from the Tail, since the difference in longitude is 1\u00b0 45\u2019. Dividing the secant of 8\u00b0 17\u2019 by the secant of 1\u00b0 45\u2019 gives the secant of 8\u00b0 6\u2019, the arc sought. This subtracted from the fixed star\u2019s northern latitude of 12\u00b0 18\u2019 leaves Mars\u2019s latitude, 4\u00b0 12\u2019 north. This I now take as determined, and compare it with the latitudes of the fixed stars according to the laws of trigonometry. From the Wing of Virgo, I find Mars\u2019s longitude to be 14\u00b0 19\u2019 Virgo; from the Neck of Leo, 14\u00b0 23\u2019 36\u201c. The mean of these two is 14\u00b0 21\u2019 18\u201c Virgo. And since the sextant gave distances larger than the truth, the latitude would come out at 4\u00b0 14\u2019 north.\nOn the night following February 23, at 12h, he observed Mars in relation to five fixed stars: the Tail of Leo and Arcturus for latitude, and for the longitude, in the first instance, Spica (which followed it), and, in the second, the Neck of Leo and Cor Leonis (which preceded it).\nBy a rough estimate, I foresee that Mars is going to fall at 11\u00bc\u00b0 Virgo. It was found to be 9\u00b0 24\u2019 from the Tail of Leo, and hence, its latitude comes out at 4\u00b0 6\u2019 ^32. And now, through this and the latitudes of the fixed stars, together with their distances (17\u00b0 26\u2019 from Regulus, 17\u00b0 51\u2019 from the Neck of Leo, 37\u00b0 28\u2019 from Spica, 44\u00b0 15\u2019 from Arcturus), Mars\u2019s position comes out at 11\u00b0 21\u2019 23\u201c Virgo (from Regulus), 11\u00b0 20\u2019 52\u201c Virgo (from the Neck of Leo), and 11\u00b0 17\u2019 40\u201c (from Spica). Again (as you see) the distances err in being too great. For from the Heart and the Neck [of Leo], Mars is pushed a little eastward, and from Spica and Arcturus a little westward, and more from Arcturus, owing to its greater northern latitude ^33. The mean (ignoring Arcturus), 11\u00b0 19\u2019 20\u201c Virgo, is very nearly true. Also, the latitude is greater, namely, 4\u00b0 7\u2019 40\u201c north. Now from February 15 at 17h to 23 February at 12h, a period of 7 days 19 hours, Mars moved 3\u00b0 0\u2019: 180 minutes in 187 hours. That is, about one minute per hour. And if you wish to take it into account, the parallax (if any) is subtracted from the longitude on February 16 and a little is added on February 23.\n Because the last observation follows the time of observation found by me by 2 days 21 hours 47 min., add the motion corresponding to this time, 1\u00b0 7\u2019: the position will come out 12\u00b0 26\u2019 Virgo. The agreement is thus very good\u2014it could not be better\u2014given that both of us [that is, Kepler and Fabricius] work independently and do not rely on the facilities used by Tycho Brahe.","1756":"VIII. On 1595 October 30 at 8h 20m, the planet was found at 17\u00b0 47\u2019 15\u201c Taurus,19 not far from the nonagesimal. We may thus be sure of the parallax, although we must take it into account. The latitude was 0\u00b0 5\u2019 10\u201c north. The sun\u2019s position was 16\u00b0 50\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio. The distance between the stars was 56\u2019 45\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 35\u201c; that of Mars, 22\u2019 54\u201c, as appears by comparing the nearby observations. The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 23\u2019 29\u201c. If the distance between the stars be divided by this, it comes out to 40\u2019 47\u201c of a day, or 16 hours 19 min. Therefore, the true opposition was 0h 39m PM on October 31. Mars\u2019s position was 17\u00b0 31\u2019 40\u201c Taurus. This needs no reduction to the orbit, as it is nearly at the node. The latitude was about 0\u00b0 8\u2019 north. But comparison with the preceding and following days shows a latitude of about 5\u2019 north.\nIX. Let, at any rate, Mars\u2019s position on 1597 December 10 at 8h 30m be 3\u00b0 45\u00bd\u2019 Cancer (as above) ^20. The sun\u2019s position was 29\u00b0 4\u2019 53\u201c Sagittarius. The distance between the stars was 4\u00b0 40\u2019 37\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 61\u2019 20\u201c, that of Mars 23\u2019 40\u201c (for in 1580 the diurnal motion in Gemini was 23\u2019, and in 1582, at 17\u00b0 Cancer, it was 24\u2019). Therefore, the sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 25\u2019 0\u201c. These data show that the time of true opposition followed 3 days 7 hours 14 min. later, on December 14 at 3h 44m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 2\u00b0 27\u2153\u2019 Cancer. The reduction to the orbit (quite ridiculous here, since the observation itself has an uncertainty of several minutes) requires the addition of about 52\u201c. Therefore, the corrected position was 2\u00b0 28\u2019 Cancer. The latitude, from the table, was 3\u00b0 33\u2019 north.\nOn the same night, the one following December 10, at 12\u2159h, Fabricius in East Frisia found Mars\u2019s position to be 3\u00b0 40\u00bc\u2019 Cancer with latitude 3\u00b0 23\u2019 N. In this observation the longitude comes out nearly the same. For the motion over 3h 40m is 3\u00bd\u2019, so that in the Brahean observation too, at 12\u2159h Mars could have been at 3\u00b0 42\u2019 Cancer\u2014two minutes beyond the Fabrician position.\nX. On 1600 January 13\/23 at 11h 40m, the time being adjusted to Uraniborg time, the planet was observed at 10\u00b0 38\u2019 46\u201c Leo ^21. The sun\u2019s position was 3\u00b0 26\u2019 30\u201c Aquarius. The stars were 7\u00b0 12\u2019 16\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion for the next few days was 1\u00b0 1\u2019 3\u201c; that of Mars, 23\u2019 44\u201c. The sum: 1\u00b0 24\u2019 47\u201c. The opposition therefore followed 5 days 2h 22m after; that is, on January 19\/29 at 2h 2m in the morning, before dawn. Mars was at 8\u00b0 38\u2019 Leo. There is no need for reduction, since it is near the limit. The latitude, from the table, was 4\u00b0 30\u2019 50\u201c N.\nXI. On the evening of 1602 Febr. 18\/28 at 10h 30m, using the Tychonic  instruments (with the help of the learned Matthias Seiffard,22 bequeathed us by Tycho), I took the distance of Mars from the middle star of the tail of Ursa Major 23 to be 52\u00b0 22\u2019. And since the distance between Cor Leonis and Procyon was 37\u00b0 22\u2019 20\u201c, which should have been 37\u00b0 19\u2019 50\u201c,24 we know that the sextant reads 2\u00bd minutes high. Therefore, the corrected distance of Mars from the tail of Ursa was 52\u00b0 19\u00bd\u2019. And since the latitude of the fixed star is 56\u00b0 22\u2019, the remainder, by subtraction, is 4\u00b0 2\u00bd\u2019\u2014supposing that Mars was at precisely the same longitude as the fixed star. But because there was a difference of 3\u00be degrees between them (as is clear from the following observations), a slight correction is required.\n For let AB be 3\u00b0 43\u2019 30\u201c on a parallel close to the ecliptic, B Mars, C the fixed star, and BC 52\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c. Dividing the secant of BC by the secant of AB gives the  secant of CA, 52\u00b0 14\u2019, which, subtracted from 56\u00b0 22\u2019 (the latitude of the fixed star) leaves 4\u00b0 8\u2019 north as Mars\u2019s observed latitude. At the same time, we found 19\u00b0 23\u2019 between Mars and Cor Leonis (19\u00b0 20\u00bd corrected), and 21\u00b0 20\u2019 between Mars and the bright star in the wing of Virgo25 (21\u00b0 17\u00bd\u2019 corrected). From these two distances (using the latitudes of the stars and Mars), Mars\u2019s longitude is found to be 13\u00b0 19\u2019 6\u201c Virgo, by consensus of all measurements.\nAlternatively, the meridian altitude of Mars was found at 12h 40m, using two quadrants, to be 50\u00b0 19\u2019, while the tail of Leo26 was 56\u00b0 45\u2019. Therefore, from the declinations and right ascensions of the fixed stars and our distances, Mars\u2019s position is determined as 13\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c Virgo, latitude 4\u00b0 7\u2019 55\u201c ^27. This is the Tychonic procedure. I have included the other for the sake of showing a consensus, and also that it might be evident that despite the lack of absolute perfection in the demonstration, short cuts either in computation or in our understanding can under certain circumstances be applied. For in that previous procedure there is less in the actual work than in the reporting of it. At Prague, 5\u00b0 Scorpio was rising ^28. Therefore, the nonagesimal was about 32\u00bd\u00b0 from the zenith. And since Mars\u2019s distance from the earth was rather more than half the sun\u2019s distance, the resulting parallax of about 5\u2019 opposite 32\u00bd\u00b0 in our parallactic table, shows a latitudinal parallax of 2\u2019 41\u201c. Thus the latitude as seen from the middle of the earth would be 4\u00b0 10\u2154\u2019 north. And because the altitude of the nonagesimal was 57\u00bd\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax at the horizon was 4\u2019 13\u201c. But since Mars was 38\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, the longitudinal parallax corresponding to this position is 2\u2019 36\u201c, and if this be eliminated, Mars would be placed at about 13\u00b0 18\u2019 Virgo ^29. At that moment, the sun\u2019s position was 10\u00b0 16\u2019 42\u201c Pisces. The distance between the bodies was 3\u00b0 1\u2019 18\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 4\u201c, and that of Mars, 24\u2019 5\u201c (for it was 24\u2019 18\u201c at 21\u00b0 Leo in 1585, and 24\u2019 at 26 Virgo in 1587). The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 24\u2019 9\u201c. The true opposition therefore followed 2 days 3 hours 43 minutes later, on 21 February\/3 March before dawn at 2h 13m, Mars being at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 35\u201c Virgo. Forty seconds must be subtracted to reduce the position to the orbit, putting Mars at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 Virgo, with slightly less latitude than before, since the latitude was then decreasing. It was therefore about 4\u00b0 10\u2019, or 4\u00b0 7\u2153\u2019 if the parallax be neglected.\n But because, since Tycho\u2019s death, we have not made frequent observations nor continued them over several days, it would be best, for certainty\u2019s sake, also to make use of those observations which David Fabricius of East Frisia, a sedulous practitioner of astronomy, has communicated to me.\nOn February 16, old style, at 5h in the morning, he took the planet\u2019s distances from the tail of Leo (for the latitude), from the neck of Leo,30 and, on the other hand, from the bright star in the southern wing of Virgo, so as to check its longitude by working it out twice.\nI could make use of Tycho\u2019s line of reasoning, which he routinely adopted in volume I of the Progymnasmata when (as here) the declination of the planet was not known. But because that method extends to ten operations, I prefer for the sake of brevity to proceed as I did before with my own observations. Here there are no hidden dangers.\nFirst, the star in the wing of Virgo, adjusted to our time, is at 4\u00b0 36\u2019 30\u201c Libra with latitude 2\u00b0 50\u2019 north. Fabricius found that Mars is 20\u00b0 18\u2019 westward from it on the zodiac, which puts Mars at about 14\u00b0 18\u2019 30\u201c Virgo. This is a preliminary, approximate figure: the longitude will shortly be corrected. Now the tail of Leo31 is at 16\u00b0 4\u2019 Virgo, with latitude 12\u00b0 18\u2019 North, and Mars was found to be 8\u00b0 17\u2019 distant from the Tail. What is sought is the distance of its parallel from the Tail, since the difference in longitude is 1\u00b0 45\u2019. Dividing the secant of 8\u00b0 17\u2019 by the secant of 1\u00b0 45\u2019 gives the secant of 8\u00b0 6\u2019, the arc sought. This subtracted from the fixed star\u2019s northern latitude of 12\u00b0 18\u2019 leaves Mars\u2019s latitude, 4\u00b0 12\u2019 north. This I now take as determined, and compare it with the latitudes of the fixed stars according to the laws of trigonometry. From the Wing of Virgo, I find Mars\u2019s longitude to be 14\u00b0 19\u2019 Virgo; from the Neck of Leo, 14\u00b0 23\u2019 36\u201c. The mean of these two is 14\u00b0 21\u2019 18\u201c Virgo. And since the sextant gave distances larger than the truth, the latitude would come out at 4\u00b0 14\u2019 north.\nOn the night following February 23, at 12h, he observed Mars in relation to five fixed stars: the Tail of Leo and Arcturus for latitude, and for the longitude, in the first instance, Spica (which followed it), and, in the second, the Neck of Leo and Cor Leonis (which preceded it).\nBy a rough estimate, I foresee that Mars is going to fall at 11\u00bc\u00b0 Virgo. It was found to be 9\u00b0 24\u2019 from the Tail of Leo, and hence, its latitude comes out at 4\u00b0 6\u2019 ^32. And now, through this and the latitudes of the fixed stars, together with their distances (17\u00b0 26\u2019 from Regulus, 17\u00b0 51\u2019 from the Neck of Leo, 37\u00b0 28\u2019 from Spica, 44\u00b0 15\u2019 from Arcturus), Mars\u2019s position comes out at 11\u00b0 21\u2019 23\u201c Virgo (from Regulus), 11\u00b0 20\u2019 52\u201c Virgo (from the Neck of Leo), and 11\u00b0 17\u2019 40\u201c (from Spica). Again (as you see) the distances err in being too great. For from the Heart and the Neck [of Leo], Mars is pushed a little eastward, and from Spica and Arcturus a little westward, and more from Arcturus, owing to its greater northern latitude ^33. The mean (ignoring Arcturus), 11\u00b0 19\u2019 20\u201c Virgo, is very nearly true. Also, the latitude is greater, namely, 4\u00b0 7\u2019 40\u201c north. Now from February 15 at 17h to 23 February at 12h, a period of 7 days 19 hours, Mars moved 3\u00b0 0\u2019: 180 minutes in 187 hours. That is, about one minute per hour. And if you wish to take it into account, the parallax (if any) is subtracted from the longitude on February 16 and a little is added on February 23.\n Because the last observation follows the time of observation found by me by 2 days 21 hours 47 min., add the motion corresponding to this time, 1\u00b0 7\u2019: the position will come out 12\u00b0 26\u2019 Virgo. The agreement is thus very good\u2014it could not be better\u2014given that both of us [that is, Kepler and Fabricius] work independently and do not rely on the facilities used by Tycho Brahe.","1757":"VIII. On 1595 October 30 at 8h 20m, the planet was found at 17\u00b0 47\u2019 15\u201c Taurus,19 not far from the nonagesimal. We may thus be sure of the parallax, although we must take it into account. The latitude was 0\u00b0 5\u2019 10\u201c north. The sun\u2019s position was 16\u00b0 50\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio. The distance between the stars was 56\u2019 45\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 35\u201c; that of Mars, 22\u2019 54\u201c, as appears by comparing the nearby observations. The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 23\u2019 29\u201c. If the distance between the stars be divided by this, it comes out to 40\u2019 47\u201c of a day, or 16 hours 19 min. Therefore, the true opposition was 0h 39m PM on October 31. Mars\u2019s position was 17\u00b0 31\u2019 40\u201c Taurus. This needs no reduction to the orbit, as it is nearly at the node. The latitude was about 0\u00b0 8\u2019 north. But comparison with the preceding and following days shows a latitude of about 5\u2019 north.\nIX. Let, at any rate, Mars\u2019s position on 1597 December 10 at 8h 30m be 3\u00b0 45\u00bd\u2019 Cancer (as above) ^20. The sun\u2019s position was 29\u00b0 4\u2019 53\u201c Sagittarius. The distance between the stars was 4\u00b0 40\u2019 37\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 61\u2019 20\u201c, that of Mars 23\u2019 40\u201c (for in 1580 the diurnal motion in Gemini was 23\u2019, and in 1582, at 17\u00b0 Cancer, it was 24\u2019). Therefore, the sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 25\u2019 0\u201c. These data show that the time of true opposition followed 3 days 7 hours 14 min. later, on December 14 at 3h 44m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 2\u00b0 27\u2153\u2019 Cancer. The reduction to the orbit (quite ridiculous here, since the observation itself has an uncertainty of several minutes) requires the addition of about 52\u201c. Therefore, the corrected position was 2\u00b0 28\u2019 Cancer. The latitude, from the table, was 3\u00b0 33\u2019 north.\nOn the same night, the one following December 10, at 12\u2159h, Fabricius in East Frisia found Mars\u2019s position to be 3\u00b0 40\u00bc\u2019 Cancer with latitude 3\u00b0 23\u2019 N. In this observation the longitude comes out nearly the same. For the motion over 3h 40m is 3\u00bd\u2019, so that in the Brahean observation too, at 12\u2159h Mars could have been at 3\u00b0 42\u2019 Cancer\u2014two minutes beyond the Fabrician position.\nX. On 1600 January 13\/23 at 11h 40m, the time being adjusted to Uraniborg time, the planet was observed at 10\u00b0 38\u2019 46\u201c Leo ^21. The sun\u2019s position was 3\u00b0 26\u2019 30\u201c Aquarius. The stars were 7\u00b0 12\u2019 16\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion for the next few days was 1\u00b0 1\u2019 3\u201c; that of Mars, 23\u2019 44\u201c. The sum: 1\u00b0 24\u2019 47\u201c. The opposition therefore followed 5 days 2h 22m after; that is, on January 19\/29 at 2h 2m in the morning, before dawn. Mars was at 8\u00b0 38\u2019 Leo. There is no need for reduction, since it is near the limit. The latitude, from the table, was 4\u00b0 30\u2019 50\u201c N.\nXI. On the evening of 1602 Febr. 18\/28 at 10h 30m, using the Tychonic  instruments (with the help of the learned Matthias Seiffard,22 bequeathed us by Tycho), I took the distance of Mars from the middle star of the tail of Ursa Major 23 to be 52\u00b0 22\u2019. And since the distance between Cor Leonis and Procyon was 37\u00b0 22\u2019 20\u201c, which should have been 37\u00b0 19\u2019 50\u201c,24 we know that the sextant reads 2\u00bd minutes high. Therefore, the corrected distance of Mars from the tail of Ursa was 52\u00b0 19\u00bd\u2019. And since the latitude of the fixed star is 56\u00b0 22\u2019, the remainder, by subtraction, is 4\u00b0 2\u00bd\u2019\u2014supposing that Mars was at precisely the same longitude as the fixed star. But because there was a difference of 3\u00be degrees between them (as is clear from the following observations), a slight correction is required.\n For let AB be 3\u00b0 43\u2019 30\u201c on a parallel close to the ecliptic, B Mars, C the fixed star, and BC 52\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c. Dividing the secant of BC by the secant of AB gives the  secant of CA, 52\u00b0 14\u2019, which, subtracted from 56\u00b0 22\u2019 (the latitude of the fixed star) leaves 4\u00b0 8\u2019 north as Mars\u2019s observed latitude. At the same time, we found 19\u00b0 23\u2019 between Mars and Cor Leonis (19\u00b0 20\u00bd corrected), and 21\u00b0 20\u2019 between Mars and the bright star in the wing of Virgo25 (21\u00b0 17\u00bd\u2019 corrected). From these two distances (using the latitudes of the stars and Mars), Mars\u2019s longitude is found to be 13\u00b0 19\u2019 6\u201c Virgo, by consensus of all measurements.\nAlternatively, the meridian altitude of Mars was found at 12h 40m, using two quadrants, to be 50\u00b0 19\u2019, while the tail of Leo26 was 56\u00b0 45\u2019. Therefore, from the declinations and right ascensions of the fixed stars and our distances, Mars\u2019s position is determined as 13\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c Virgo, latitude 4\u00b0 7\u2019 55\u201c ^27. This is the Tychonic procedure. I have included the other for the sake of showing a consensus, and also that it might be evident that despite the lack of absolute perfection in the demonstration, short cuts either in computation or in our understanding can under certain circumstances be applied. For in that previous procedure there is less in the actual work than in the reporting of it. At Prague, 5\u00b0 Scorpio was rising ^28. Therefore, the nonagesimal was about 32\u00bd\u00b0 from the zenith. And since Mars\u2019s distance from the earth was rather more than half the sun\u2019s distance, the resulting parallax of about 5\u2019 opposite 32\u00bd\u00b0 in our parallactic table, shows a latitudinal parallax of 2\u2019 41\u201c. Thus the latitude as seen from the middle of the earth would be 4\u00b0 10\u2154\u2019 north. And because the altitude of the nonagesimal was 57\u00bd\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax at the horizon was 4\u2019 13\u201c. But since Mars was 38\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, the longitudinal parallax corresponding to this position is 2\u2019 36\u201c, and if this be eliminated, Mars would be placed at about 13\u00b0 18\u2019 Virgo ^29. At that moment, the sun\u2019s position was 10\u00b0 16\u2019 42\u201c Pisces. The distance between the bodies was 3\u00b0 1\u2019 18\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 4\u201c, and that of Mars, 24\u2019 5\u201c (for it was 24\u2019 18\u201c at 21\u00b0 Leo in 1585, and 24\u2019 at 26 Virgo in 1587). The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 24\u2019 9\u201c. The true opposition therefore followed 2 days 3 hours 43 minutes later, on 21 February\/3 March before dawn at 2h 13m, Mars being at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 35\u201c Virgo. Forty seconds must be subtracted to reduce the position to the orbit, putting Mars at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 Virgo, with slightly less latitude than before, since the latitude was then decreasing. It was therefore about 4\u00b0 10\u2019, or 4\u00b0 7\u2153\u2019 if the parallax be neglected.\n But because, since Tycho\u2019s death, we have not made frequent observations nor continued them over several days, it would be best, for certainty\u2019s sake, also to make use of those observations which David Fabricius of East Frisia, a sedulous practitioner of astronomy, has communicated to me.\nOn February 16, old style, at 5h in the morning, he took the planet\u2019s distances from the tail of Leo (for the latitude), from the neck of Leo,30 and, on the other hand, from the bright star in the southern wing of Virgo, so as to check its longitude by working it out twice.\nI could make use of Tycho\u2019s line of reasoning, which he routinely adopted in volume I of the Progymnasmata when (as here) the declination of the planet was not known. But because that method extends to ten operations, I prefer for the sake of brevity to proceed as I did before with my own observations. Here there are no hidden dangers.\nFirst, the star in the wing of Virgo, adjusted to our time, is at 4\u00b0 36\u2019 30\u201c Libra with latitude 2\u00b0 50\u2019 north. Fabricius found that Mars is 20\u00b0 18\u2019 westward from it on the zodiac, which puts Mars at about 14\u00b0 18\u2019 30\u201c Virgo. This is a preliminary, approximate figure: the longitude will shortly be corrected. Now the tail of Leo31 is at 16\u00b0 4\u2019 Virgo, with latitude 12\u00b0 18\u2019 North, and Mars was found to be 8\u00b0 17\u2019 distant from the Tail. What is sought is the distance of its parallel from the Tail, since the difference in longitude is 1\u00b0 45\u2019. Dividing the secant of 8\u00b0 17\u2019 by the secant of 1\u00b0 45\u2019 gives the secant of 8\u00b0 6\u2019, the arc sought. This subtracted from the fixed star\u2019s northern latitude of 12\u00b0 18\u2019 leaves Mars\u2019s latitude, 4\u00b0 12\u2019 north. This I now take as determined, and compare it with the latitudes of the fixed stars according to the laws of trigonometry. From the Wing of Virgo, I find Mars\u2019s longitude to be 14\u00b0 19\u2019 Virgo; from the Neck of Leo, 14\u00b0 23\u2019 36\u201c. The mean of these two is 14\u00b0 21\u2019 18\u201c Virgo. And since the sextant gave distances larger than the truth, the latitude would come out at 4\u00b0 14\u2019 north.\nOn the night following February 23, at 12h, he observed Mars in relation to five fixed stars: the Tail of Leo and Arcturus for latitude, and for the longitude, in the first instance, Spica (which followed it), and, in the second, the Neck of Leo and Cor Leonis (which preceded it).\nBy a rough estimate, I foresee that Mars is going to fall at 11\u00bc\u00b0 Virgo. It was found to be 9\u00b0 24\u2019 from the Tail of Leo, and hence, its latitude comes out at 4\u00b0 6\u2019 ^32. And now, through this and the latitudes of the fixed stars, together with their distances (17\u00b0 26\u2019 from Regulus, 17\u00b0 51\u2019 from the Neck of Leo, 37\u00b0 28\u2019 from Spica, 44\u00b0 15\u2019 from Arcturus), Mars\u2019s position comes out at 11\u00b0 21\u2019 23\u201c Virgo (from Regulus), 11\u00b0 20\u2019 52\u201c Virgo (from the Neck of Leo), and 11\u00b0 17\u2019 40\u201c (from Spica). Again (as you see) the distances err in being too great. For from the Heart and the Neck [of Leo], Mars is pushed a little eastward, and from Spica and Arcturus a little westward, and more from Arcturus, owing to its greater northern latitude ^33. The mean (ignoring Arcturus), 11\u00b0 19\u2019 20\u201c Virgo, is very nearly true. Also, the latitude is greater, namely, 4\u00b0 7\u2019 40\u201c north. Now from February 15 at 17h to 23 February at 12h, a period of 7 days 19 hours, Mars moved 3\u00b0 0\u2019: 180 minutes in 187 hours. That is, about one minute per hour. And if you wish to take it into account, the parallax (if any) is subtracted from the longitude on February 16 and a little is added on February 23.\n Because the last observation follows the time of observation found by me by 2 days 21 hours 47 min., add the motion corresponding to this time, 1\u00b0 7\u2019: the position will come out 12\u00b0 26\u2019 Virgo. The agreement is thus very good\u2014it could not be better\u2014given that both of us [that is, Kepler and Fabricius] work independently and do not rely on the facilities used by Tycho Brahe.","1758":"VIII. On 1595 October 30 at 8h 20m, the planet was found at 17\u00b0 47\u2019 15\u201c Taurus,19 not far from the nonagesimal. We may thus be sure of the parallax, although we must take it into account. The latitude was 0\u00b0 5\u2019 10\u201c north. The sun\u2019s position was 16\u00b0 50\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio. The distance between the stars was 56\u2019 45\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 35\u201c; that of Mars, 22\u2019 54\u201c, as appears by comparing the nearby observations. The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 23\u2019 29\u201c. If the distance between the stars be divided by this, it comes out to 40\u2019 47\u201c of a day, or 16 hours 19 min. Therefore, the true opposition was 0h 39m PM on October 31. Mars\u2019s position was 17\u00b0 31\u2019 40\u201c Taurus. This needs no reduction to the orbit, as it is nearly at the node. The latitude was about 0\u00b0 8\u2019 north. But comparison with the preceding and following days shows a latitude of about 5\u2019 north.\nIX. Let, at any rate, Mars\u2019s position on 1597 December 10 at 8h 30m be 3\u00b0 45\u00bd\u2019 Cancer (as above) ^20. The sun\u2019s position was 29\u00b0 4\u2019 53\u201c Sagittarius. The distance between the stars was 4\u00b0 40\u2019 37\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 61\u2019 20\u201c, that of Mars 23\u2019 40\u201c (for in 1580 the diurnal motion in Gemini was 23\u2019, and in 1582, at 17\u00b0 Cancer, it was 24\u2019). Therefore, the sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 25\u2019 0\u201c. These data show that the time of true opposition followed 3 days 7 hours 14 min. later, on December 14 at 3h 44m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 2\u00b0 27\u2153\u2019 Cancer. The reduction to the orbit (quite ridiculous here, since the observation itself has an uncertainty of several minutes) requires the addition of about 52\u201c. Therefore, the corrected position was 2\u00b0 28\u2019 Cancer. The latitude, from the table, was 3\u00b0 33\u2019 north.\nOn the same night, the one following December 10, at 12\u2159h, Fabricius in East Frisia found Mars\u2019s position to be 3\u00b0 40\u00bc\u2019 Cancer with latitude 3\u00b0 23\u2019 N. In this observation the longitude comes out nearly the same. For the motion over 3h 40m is 3\u00bd\u2019, so that in the Brahean observation too, at 12\u2159h Mars could have been at 3\u00b0 42\u2019 Cancer\u2014two minutes beyond the Fabrician position.\nX. On 1600 January 13\/23 at 11h 40m, the time being adjusted to Uraniborg time, the planet was observed at 10\u00b0 38\u2019 46\u201c Leo ^21. The sun\u2019s position was 3\u00b0 26\u2019 30\u201c Aquarius. The stars were 7\u00b0 12\u2019 16\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion for the next few days was 1\u00b0 1\u2019 3\u201c; that of Mars, 23\u2019 44\u201c. The sum: 1\u00b0 24\u2019 47\u201c. The opposition therefore followed 5 days 2h 22m after; that is, on January 19\/29 at 2h 2m in the morning, before dawn. Mars was at 8\u00b0 38\u2019 Leo. There is no need for reduction, since it is near the limit. The latitude, from the table, was 4\u00b0 30\u2019 50\u201c N.\nXI. On the evening of 1602 Febr. 18\/28 at 10h 30m, using the Tychonic  instruments (with the help of the learned Matthias Seiffard,22 bequeathed us by Tycho), I took the distance of Mars from the middle star of the tail of Ursa Major 23 to be 52\u00b0 22\u2019. And since the distance between Cor Leonis and Procyon was 37\u00b0 22\u2019 20\u201c, which should have been 37\u00b0 19\u2019 50\u201c,24 we know that the sextant reads 2\u00bd minutes high. Therefore, the corrected distance of Mars from the tail of Ursa was 52\u00b0 19\u00bd\u2019. And since the latitude of the fixed star is 56\u00b0 22\u2019, the remainder, by subtraction, is 4\u00b0 2\u00bd\u2019\u2014supposing that Mars was at precisely the same longitude as the fixed star. But because there was a difference of 3\u00be degrees between them (as is clear from the following observations), a slight correction is required.\n For let AB be 3\u00b0 43\u2019 30\u201c on a parallel close to the ecliptic, B Mars, C the fixed star, and BC 52\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c. Dividing the secant of BC by the secant of AB gives the  secant of CA, 52\u00b0 14\u2019, which, subtracted from 56\u00b0 22\u2019 (the latitude of the fixed star) leaves 4\u00b0 8\u2019 north as Mars\u2019s observed latitude. At the same time, we found 19\u00b0 23\u2019 between Mars and Cor Leonis (19\u00b0 20\u00bd corrected), and 21\u00b0 20\u2019 between Mars and the bright star in the wing of Virgo25 (21\u00b0 17\u00bd\u2019 corrected). From these two distances (using the latitudes of the stars and Mars), Mars\u2019s longitude is found to be 13\u00b0 19\u2019 6\u201c Virgo, by consensus of all measurements.\nAlternatively, the meridian altitude of Mars was found at 12h 40m, using two quadrants, to be 50\u00b0 19\u2019, while the tail of Leo26 was 56\u00b0 45\u2019. Therefore, from the declinations and right ascensions of the fixed stars and our distances, Mars\u2019s position is determined as 13\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c Virgo, latitude 4\u00b0 7\u2019 55\u201c ^27. This is the Tychonic procedure. I have included the other for the sake of showing a consensus, and also that it might be evident that despite the lack of absolute perfection in the demonstration, short cuts either in computation or in our understanding can under certain circumstances be applied. For in that previous procedure there is less in the actual work than in the reporting of it. At Prague, 5\u00b0 Scorpio was rising ^28. Therefore, the nonagesimal was about 32\u00bd\u00b0 from the zenith. And since Mars\u2019s distance from the earth was rather more than half the sun\u2019s distance, the resulting parallax of about 5\u2019 opposite 32\u00bd\u00b0 in our parallactic table, shows a latitudinal parallax of 2\u2019 41\u201c. Thus the latitude as seen from the middle of the earth would be 4\u00b0 10\u2154\u2019 north. And because the altitude of the nonagesimal was 57\u00bd\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax at the horizon was 4\u2019 13\u201c. But since Mars was 38\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, the longitudinal parallax corresponding to this position is 2\u2019 36\u201c, and if this be eliminated, Mars would be placed at about 13\u00b0 18\u2019 Virgo ^29. At that moment, the sun\u2019s position was 10\u00b0 16\u2019 42\u201c Pisces. The distance between the bodies was 3\u00b0 1\u2019 18\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 4\u201c, and that of Mars, 24\u2019 5\u201c (for it was 24\u2019 18\u201c at 21\u00b0 Leo in 1585, and 24\u2019 at 26 Virgo in 1587). The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 24\u2019 9\u201c. The true opposition therefore followed 2 days 3 hours 43 minutes later, on 21 February\/3 March before dawn at 2h 13m, Mars being at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 35\u201c Virgo. Forty seconds must be subtracted to reduce the position to the orbit, putting Mars at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 Virgo, with slightly less latitude than before, since the latitude was then decreasing. It was therefore about 4\u00b0 10\u2019, or 4\u00b0 7\u2153\u2019 if the parallax be neglected.\n But because, since Tycho\u2019s death, we have not made frequent observations nor continued them over several days, it would be best, for certainty\u2019s sake, also to make use of those observations which David Fabricius of East Frisia, a sedulous practitioner of astronomy, has communicated to me.\nOn February 16, old style, at 5h in the morning, he took the planet\u2019s distances from the tail of Leo (for the latitude), from the neck of Leo,30 and, on the other hand, from the bright star in the southern wing of Virgo, so as to check its longitude by working it out twice.\nI could make use of Tycho\u2019s line of reasoning, which he routinely adopted in volume I of the Progymnasmata when (as here) the declination of the planet was not known. But because that method extends to ten operations, I prefer for the sake of brevity to proceed as I did before with my own observations. Here there are no hidden dangers.\nFirst, the star in the wing of Virgo, adjusted to our time, is at 4\u00b0 36\u2019 30\u201c Libra with latitude 2\u00b0 50\u2019 north. Fabricius found that Mars is 20\u00b0 18\u2019 westward from it on the zodiac, which puts Mars at about 14\u00b0 18\u2019 30\u201c Virgo. This is a preliminary, approximate figure: the longitude will shortly be corrected. Now the tail of Leo31 is at 16\u00b0 4\u2019 Virgo, with latitude 12\u00b0 18\u2019 North, and Mars was found to be 8\u00b0 17\u2019 distant from the Tail. What is sought is the distance of its parallel from the Tail, since the difference in longitude is 1\u00b0 45\u2019. Dividing the secant of 8\u00b0 17\u2019 by the secant of 1\u00b0 45\u2019 gives the secant of 8\u00b0 6\u2019, the arc sought. This subtracted from the fixed star\u2019s northern latitude of 12\u00b0 18\u2019 leaves Mars\u2019s latitude, 4\u00b0 12\u2019 north. This I now take as determined, and compare it with the latitudes of the fixed stars according to the laws of trigonometry. From the Wing of Virgo, I find Mars\u2019s longitude to be 14\u00b0 19\u2019 Virgo; from the Neck of Leo, 14\u00b0 23\u2019 36\u201c. The mean of these two is 14\u00b0 21\u2019 18\u201c Virgo. And since the sextant gave distances larger than the truth, the latitude would come out at 4\u00b0 14\u2019 north.\nOn the night following February 23, at 12h, he observed Mars in relation to five fixed stars: the Tail of Leo and Arcturus for latitude, and for the longitude, in the first instance, Spica (which followed it), and, in the second, the Neck of Leo and Cor Leonis (which preceded it).\nBy a rough estimate, I foresee that Mars is going to fall at 11\u00bc\u00b0 Virgo. It was found to be 9\u00b0 24\u2019 from the Tail of Leo, and hence, its latitude comes out at 4\u00b0 6\u2019 ^32. And now, through this and the latitudes of the fixed stars, together with their distances (17\u00b0 26\u2019 from Regulus, 17\u00b0 51\u2019 from the Neck of Leo, 37\u00b0 28\u2019 from Spica, 44\u00b0 15\u2019 from Arcturus), Mars\u2019s position comes out at 11\u00b0 21\u2019 23\u201c Virgo (from Regulus), 11\u00b0 20\u2019 52\u201c Virgo (from the Neck of Leo), and 11\u00b0 17\u2019 40\u201c (from Spica). Again (as you see) the distances err in being too great. For from the Heart and the Neck [of Leo], Mars is pushed a little eastward, and from Spica and Arcturus a little westward, and more from Arcturus, owing to its greater northern latitude ^33. The mean (ignoring Arcturus), 11\u00b0 19\u2019 20\u201c Virgo, is very nearly true. Also, the latitude is greater, namely, 4\u00b0 7\u2019 40\u201c north. Now from February 15 at 17h to 23 February at 12h, a period of 7 days 19 hours, Mars moved 3\u00b0 0\u2019: 180 minutes in 187 hours. That is, about one minute per hour. And if you wish to take it into account, the parallax (if any) is subtracted from the longitude on February 16 and a little is added on February 23.\n Because the last observation follows the time of observation found by me by 2 days 21 hours 47 min., add the motion corresponding to this time, 1\u00b0 7\u2019: the position will come out 12\u00b0 26\u2019 Virgo. The agreement is thus very good\u2014it could not be better\u2014given that both of us [that is, Kepler and Fabricius] work independently and do not rely on the facilities used by Tycho Brahe.","1759":"VIII. On 1595 October 30 at 8h 20m, the planet was found at 17\u00b0 47\u2019 15\u201c Taurus,19 not far from the nonagesimal. We may thus be sure of the parallax, although we must take it into account. The latitude was 0\u00b0 5\u2019 10\u201c north. The sun\u2019s position was 16\u00b0 50\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio. The distance between the stars was 56\u2019 45\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 35\u201c; that of Mars, 22\u2019 54\u201c, as appears by comparing the nearby observations. The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 23\u2019 29\u201c. If the distance between the stars be divided by this, it comes out to 40\u2019 47\u201c of a day, or 16 hours 19 min. Therefore, the true opposition was 0h 39m PM on October 31. Mars\u2019s position was 17\u00b0 31\u2019 40\u201c Taurus. This needs no reduction to the orbit, as it is nearly at the node. The latitude was about 0\u00b0 8\u2019 north. But comparison with the preceding and following days shows a latitude of about 5\u2019 north.\nIX. Let, at any rate, Mars\u2019s position on 1597 December 10 at 8h 30m be 3\u00b0 45\u00bd\u2019 Cancer (as above) ^20. The sun\u2019s position was 29\u00b0 4\u2019 53\u201c Sagittarius. The distance between the stars was 4\u00b0 40\u2019 37\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 61\u2019 20\u201c, that of Mars 23\u2019 40\u201c (for in 1580 the diurnal motion in Gemini was 23\u2019, and in 1582, at 17\u00b0 Cancer, it was 24\u2019). Therefore, the sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 25\u2019 0\u201c. These data show that the time of true opposition followed 3 days 7 hours 14 min. later, on December 14 at 3h 44m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 2\u00b0 27\u2153\u2019 Cancer. The reduction to the orbit (quite ridiculous here, since the observation itself has an uncertainty of several minutes) requires the addition of about 52\u201c. Therefore, the corrected position was 2\u00b0 28\u2019 Cancer. The latitude, from the table, was 3\u00b0 33\u2019 north.\nOn the same night, the one following December 10, at 12\u2159h, Fabricius in East Frisia found Mars\u2019s position to be 3\u00b0 40\u00bc\u2019 Cancer with latitude 3\u00b0 23\u2019 N. In this observation the longitude comes out nearly the same. For the motion over 3h 40m is 3\u00bd\u2019, so that in the Brahean observation too, at 12\u2159h Mars could have been at 3\u00b0 42\u2019 Cancer\u2014two minutes beyond the Fabrician position.\nX. On 1600 January 13\/23 at 11h 40m, the time being adjusted to Uraniborg time, the planet was observed at 10\u00b0 38\u2019 46\u201c Leo ^21. The sun\u2019s position was 3\u00b0 26\u2019 30\u201c Aquarius. The stars were 7\u00b0 12\u2019 16\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion for the next few days was 1\u00b0 1\u2019 3\u201c; that of Mars, 23\u2019 44\u201c. The sum: 1\u00b0 24\u2019 47\u201c. The opposition therefore followed 5 days 2h 22m after; that is, on January 19\/29 at 2h 2m in the morning, before dawn. Mars was at 8\u00b0 38\u2019 Leo. There is no need for reduction, since it is near the limit. The latitude, from the table, was 4\u00b0 30\u2019 50\u201c N.\nXI. On the evening of 1602 Febr. 18\/28 at 10h 30m, using the Tychonic  instruments (with the help of the learned Matthias Seiffard,22 bequeathed us by Tycho), I took the distance of Mars from the middle star of the tail of Ursa Major 23 to be 52\u00b0 22\u2019. And since the distance between Cor Leonis and Procyon was 37\u00b0 22\u2019 20\u201c, which should have been 37\u00b0 19\u2019 50\u201c,24 we know that the sextant reads 2\u00bd minutes high. Therefore, the corrected distance of Mars from the tail of Ursa was 52\u00b0 19\u00bd\u2019. And since the latitude of the fixed star is 56\u00b0 22\u2019, the remainder, by subtraction, is 4\u00b0 2\u00bd\u2019\u2014supposing that Mars was at precisely the same longitude as the fixed star. But because there was a difference of 3\u00be degrees between them (as is clear from the following observations), a slight correction is required.\n For let AB be 3\u00b0 43\u2019 30\u201c on a parallel close to the ecliptic, B Mars, C the fixed star, and BC 52\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c. Dividing the secant of BC by the secant of AB gives the  secant of CA, 52\u00b0 14\u2019, which, subtracted from 56\u00b0 22\u2019 (the latitude of the fixed star) leaves 4\u00b0 8\u2019 north as Mars\u2019s observed latitude. At the same time, we found 19\u00b0 23\u2019 between Mars and Cor Leonis (19\u00b0 20\u00bd corrected), and 21\u00b0 20\u2019 between Mars and the bright star in the wing of Virgo25 (21\u00b0 17\u00bd\u2019 corrected). From these two distances (using the latitudes of the stars and Mars), Mars\u2019s longitude is found to be 13\u00b0 19\u2019 6\u201c Virgo, by consensus of all measurements.\nAlternatively, the meridian altitude of Mars was found at 12h 40m, using two quadrants, to be 50\u00b0 19\u2019, while the tail of Leo26 was 56\u00b0 45\u2019. Therefore, from the declinations and right ascensions of the fixed stars and our distances, Mars\u2019s position is determined as 13\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c Virgo, latitude 4\u00b0 7\u2019 55\u201c ^27. This is the Tychonic procedure. I have included the other for the sake of showing a consensus, and also that it might be evident that despite the lack of absolute perfection in the demonstration, short cuts either in computation or in our understanding can under certain circumstances be applied. For in that previous procedure there is less in the actual work than in the reporting of it. At Prague, 5\u00b0 Scorpio was rising ^28. Therefore, the nonagesimal was about 32\u00bd\u00b0 from the zenith. And since Mars\u2019s distance from the earth was rather more than half the sun\u2019s distance, the resulting parallax of about 5\u2019 opposite 32\u00bd\u00b0 in our parallactic table, shows a latitudinal parallax of 2\u2019 41\u201c. Thus the latitude as seen from the middle of the earth would be 4\u00b0 10\u2154\u2019 north. And because the altitude of the nonagesimal was 57\u00bd\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax at the horizon was 4\u2019 13\u201c. But since Mars was 38\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, the longitudinal parallax corresponding to this position is 2\u2019 36\u201c, and if this be eliminated, Mars would be placed at about 13\u00b0 18\u2019 Virgo ^29. At that moment, the sun\u2019s position was 10\u00b0 16\u2019 42\u201c Pisces. The distance between the bodies was 3\u00b0 1\u2019 18\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 4\u201c, and that of Mars, 24\u2019 5\u201c (for it was 24\u2019 18\u201c at 21\u00b0 Leo in 1585, and 24\u2019 at 26 Virgo in 1587). The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 24\u2019 9\u201c. The true opposition therefore followed 2 days 3 hours 43 minutes later, on 21 February\/3 March before dawn at 2h 13m, Mars being at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 35\u201c Virgo. Forty seconds must be subtracted to reduce the position to the orbit, putting Mars at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 Virgo, with slightly less latitude than before, since the latitude was then decreasing. It was therefore about 4\u00b0 10\u2019, or 4\u00b0 7\u2153\u2019 if the parallax be neglected.\n But because, since Tycho\u2019s death, we have not made frequent observations nor continued them over several days, it would be best, for certainty\u2019s sake, also to make use of those observations which David Fabricius of East Frisia, a sedulous practitioner of astronomy, has communicated to me.\nOn February 16, old style, at 5h in the morning, he took the planet\u2019s distances from the tail of Leo (for the latitude), from the neck of Leo,30 and, on the other hand, from the bright star in the southern wing of Virgo, so as to check its longitude by working it out twice.\nI could make use of Tycho\u2019s line of reasoning, which he routinely adopted in volume I of the Progymnasmata when (as here) the declination of the planet was not known. But because that method extends to ten operations, I prefer for the sake of brevity to proceed as I did before with my own observations. Here there are no hidden dangers.\nFirst, the star in the wing of Virgo, adjusted to our time, is at 4\u00b0 36\u2019 30\u201c Libra with latitude 2\u00b0 50\u2019 north. Fabricius found that Mars is 20\u00b0 18\u2019 westward from it on the zodiac, which puts Mars at about 14\u00b0 18\u2019 30\u201c Virgo. This is a preliminary, approximate figure: the longitude will shortly be corrected. Now the tail of Leo31 is at 16\u00b0 4\u2019 Virgo, with latitude 12\u00b0 18\u2019 North, and Mars was found to be 8\u00b0 17\u2019 distant from the Tail. What is sought is the distance of its parallel from the Tail, since the difference in longitude is 1\u00b0 45\u2019. Dividing the secant of 8\u00b0 17\u2019 by the secant of 1\u00b0 45\u2019 gives the secant of 8\u00b0 6\u2019, the arc sought. This subtracted from the fixed star\u2019s northern latitude of 12\u00b0 18\u2019 leaves Mars\u2019s latitude, 4\u00b0 12\u2019 north. This I now take as determined, and compare it with the latitudes of the fixed stars according to the laws of trigonometry. From the Wing of Virgo, I find Mars\u2019s longitude to be 14\u00b0 19\u2019 Virgo; from the Neck of Leo, 14\u00b0 23\u2019 36\u201c. The mean of these two is 14\u00b0 21\u2019 18\u201c Virgo. And since the sextant gave distances larger than the truth, the latitude would come out at 4\u00b0 14\u2019 north.\nOn the night following February 23, at 12h, he observed Mars in relation to five fixed stars: the Tail of Leo and Arcturus for latitude, and for the longitude, in the first instance, Spica (which followed it), and, in the second, the Neck of Leo and Cor Leonis (which preceded it).\nBy a rough estimate, I foresee that Mars is going to fall at 11\u00bc\u00b0 Virgo. It was found to be 9\u00b0 24\u2019 from the Tail of Leo, and hence, its latitude comes out at 4\u00b0 6\u2019 ^32. And now, through this and the latitudes of the fixed stars, together with their distances (17\u00b0 26\u2019 from Regulus, 17\u00b0 51\u2019 from the Neck of Leo, 37\u00b0 28\u2019 from Spica, 44\u00b0 15\u2019 from Arcturus), Mars\u2019s position comes out at 11\u00b0 21\u2019 23\u201c Virgo (from Regulus), 11\u00b0 20\u2019 52\u201c Virgo (from the Neck of Leo), and 11\u00b0 17\u2019 40\u201c (from Spica). Again (as you see) the distances err in being too great. For from the Heart and the Neck [of Leo], Mars is pushed a little eastward, and from Spica and Arcturus a little westward, and more from Arcturus, owing to its greater northern latitude ^33. The mean (ignoring Arcturus), 11\u00b0 19\u2019 20\u201c Virgo, is very nearly true. Also, the latitude is greater, namely, 4\u00b0 7\u2019 40\u201c north. Now from February 15 at 17h to 23 February at 12h, a period of 7 days 19 hours, Mars moved 3\u00b0 0\u2019: 180 minutes in 187 hours. That is, about one minute per hour. And if you wish to take it into account, the parallax (if any) is subtracted from the longitude on February 16 and a little is added on February 23.\n Because the last observation follows the time of observation found by me by 2 days 21 hours 47 min., add the motion corresponding to this time, 1\u00b0 7\u2019: the position will come out 12\u00b0 26\u2019 Virgo. The agreement is thus very good\u2014it could not be better\u2014given that both of us [that is, Kepler and Fabricius] work independently and do not rely on the facilities used by Tycho Brahe.","1760":"VIII. On 1595 October 30 at 8h 20m, the planet was found at 17\u00b0 47\u2019 15\u201c Taurus,19 not far from the nonagesimal. We may thus be sure of the parallax, although we must take it into account. The latitude was 0\u00b0 5\u2019 10\u201c north. The sun\u2019s position was 16\u00b0 50\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio. The distance between the stars was 56\u2019 45\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 35\u201c; that of Mars, 22\u2019 54\u201c, as appears by comparing the nearby observations. The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 23\u2019 29\u201c. If the distance between the stars be divided by this, it comes out to 40\u2019 47\u201c of a day, or 16 hours 19 min. Therefore, the true opposition was 0h 39m PM on October 31. Mars\u2019s position was 17\u00b0 31\u2019 40\u201c Taurus. This needs no reduction to the orbit, as it is nearly at the node. The latitude was about 0\u00b0 8\u2019 north. But comparison with the preceding and following days shows a latitude of about 5\u2019 north.\nIX. Let, at any rate, Mars\u2019s position on 1597 December 10 at 8h 30m be 3\u00b0 45\u00bd\u2019 Cancer (as above) ^20. The sun\u2019s position was 29\u00b0 4\u2019 53\u201c Sagittarius. The distance between the stars was 4\u00b0 40\u2019 37\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 61\u2019 20\u201c, that of Mars 23\u2019 40\u201c (for in 1580 the diurnal motion in Gemini was 23\u2019, and in 1582, at 17\u00b0 Cancer, it was 24\u2019). Therefore, the sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 25\u2019 0\u201c. These data show that the time of true opposition followed 3 days 7 hours 14 min. later, on December 14 at 3h 44m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 2\u00b0 27\u2153\u2019 Cancer. The reduction to the orbit (quite ridiculous here, since the observation itself has an uncertainty of several minutes) requires the addition of about 52\u201c. Therefore, the corrected position was 2\u00b0 28\u2019 Cancer. The latitude, from the table, was 3\u00b0 33\u2019 north.\nOn the same night, the one following December 10, at 12\u2159h, Fabricius in East Frisia found Mars\u2019s position to be 3\u00b0 40\u00bc\u2019 Cancer with latitude 3\u00b0 23\u2019 N. In this observation the longitude comes out nearly the same. For the motion over 3h 40m is 3\u00bd\u2019, so that in the Brahean observation too, at 12\u2159h Mars could have been at 3\u00b0 42\u2019 Cancer\u2014two minutes beyond the Fabrician position.\nX. On 1600 January 13\/23 at 11h 40m, the time being adjusted to Uraniborg time, the planet was observed at 10\u00b0 38\u2019 46\u201c Leo ^21. The sun\u2019s position was 3\u00b0 26\u2019 30\u201c Aquarius. The stars were 7\u00b0 12\u2019 16\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion for the next few days was 1\u00b0 1\u2019 3\u201c; that of Mars, 23\u2019 44\u201c. The sum: 1\u00b0 24\u2019 47\u201c. The opposition therefore followed 5 days 2h 22m after; that is, on January 19\/29 at 2h 2m in the morning, before dawn. Mars was at 8\u00b0 38\u2019 Leo. There is no need for reduction, since it is near the limit. The latitude, from the table, was 4\u00b0 30\u2019 50\u201c N.\nXI. On the evening of 1602 Febr. 18\/28 at 10h 30m, using the Tychonic  instruments (with the help of the learned Matthias Seiffard,22 bequeathed us by Tycho), I took the distance of Mars from the middle star of the tail of Ursa Major 23 to be 52\u00b0 22\u2019. And since the distance between Cor Leonis and Procyon was 37\u00b0 22\u2019 20\u201c, which should have been 37\u00b0 19\u2019 50\u201c,24 we know that the sextant reads 2\u00bd minutes high. Therefore, the corrected distance of Mars from the tail of Ursa was 52\u00b0 19\u00bd\u2019. And since the latitude of the fixed star is 56\u00b0 22\u2019, the remainder, by subtraction, is 4\u00b0 2\u00bd\u2019\u2014supposing that Mars was at precisely the same longitude as the fixed star. But because there was a difference of 3\u00be degrees between them (as is clear from the following observations), a slight correction is required.\n For let AB be 3\u00b0 43\u2019 30\u201c on a parallel close to the ecliptic, B Mars, C the fixed star, and BC 52\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c. Dividing the secant of BC by the secant of AB gives the  secant of CA, 52\u00b0 14\u2019, which, subtracted from 56\u00b0 22\u2019 (the latitude of the fixed star) leaves 4\u00b0 8\u2019 north as Mars\u2019s observed latitude. At the same time, we found 19\u00b0 23\u2019 between Mars and Cor Leonis (19\u00b0 20\u00bd corrected), and 21\u00b0 20\u2019 between Mars and the bright star in the wing of Virgo25 (21\u00b0 17\u00bd\u2019 corrected). From these two distances (using the latitudes of the stars and Mars), Mars\u2019s longitude is found to be 13\u00b0 19\u2019 6\u201c Virgo, by consensus of all measurements.\nAlternatively, the meridian altitude of Mars was found at 12h 40m, using two quadrants, to be 50\u00b0 19\u2019, while the tail of Leo26 was 56\u00b0 45\u2019. Therefore, from the declinations and right ascensions of the fixed stars and our distances, Mars\u2019s position is determined as 13\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c Virgo, latitude 4\u00b0 7\u2019 55\u201c ^27. This is the Tychonic procedure. I have included the other for the sake of showing a consensus, and also that it might be evident that despite the lack of absolute perfection in the demonstration, short cuts either in computation or in our understanding can under certain circumstances be applied. For in that previous procedure there is less in the actual work than in the reporting of it. At Prague, 5\u00b0 Scorpio was rising ^28. Therefore, the nonagesimal was about 32\u00bd\u00b0 from the zenith. And since Mars\u2019s distance from the earth was rather more than half the sun\u2019s distance, the resulting parallax of about 5\u2019 opposite 32\u00bd\u00b0 in our parallactic table, shows a latitudinal parallax of 2\u2019 41\u201c. Thus the latitude as seen from the middle of the earth would be 4\u00b0 10\u2154\u2019 north. And because the altitude of the nonagesimal was 57\u00bd\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax at the horizon was 4\u2019 13\u201c. But since Mars was 38\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, the longitudinal parallax corresponding to this position is 2\u2019 36\u201c, and if this be eliminated, Mars would be placed at about 13\u00b0 18\u2019 Virgo ^29. At that moment, the sun\u2019s position was 10\u00b0 16\u2019 42\u201c Pisces. The distance between the bodies was 3\u00b0 1\u2019 18\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 4\u201c, and that of Mars, 24\u2019 5\u201c (for it was 24\u2019 18\u201c at 21\u00b0 Leo in 1585, and 24\u2019 at 26 Virgo in 1587). The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 24\u2019 9\u201c. The true opposition therefore followed 2 days 3 hours 43 minutes later, on 21 February\/3 March before dawn at 2h 13m, Mars being at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 35\u201c Virgo. Forty seconds must be subtracted to reduce the position to the orbit, putting Mars at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 Virgo, with slightly less latitude than before, since the latitude was then decreasing. It was therefore about 4\u00b0 10\u2019, or 4\u00b0 7\u2153\u2019 if the parallax be neglected.\n But because, since Tycho\u2019s death, we have not made frequent observations nor continued them over several days, it would be best, for certainty\u2019s sake, also to make use of those observations which David Fabricius of East Frisia, a sedulous practitioner of astronomy, has communicated to me.\nOn February 16, old style, at 5h in the morning, he took the planet\u2019s distances from the tail of Leo (for the latitude), from the neck of Leo,30 and, on the other hand, from the bright star in the southern wing of Virgo, so as to check its longitude by working it out twice.\nI could make use of Tycho\u2019s line of reasoning, which he routinely adopted in volume I of the Progymnasmata when (as here) the declination of the planet was not known. But because that method extends to ten operations, I prefer for the sake of brevity to proceed as I did before with my own observations. Here there are no hidden dangers.\nFirst, the star in the wing of Virgo, adjusted to our time, is at 4\u00b0 36\u2019 30\u201c Libra with latitude 2\u00b0 50\u2019 north. Fabricius found that Mars is 20\u00b0 18\u2019 westward from it on the zodiac, which puts Mars at about 14\u00b0 18\u2019 30\u201c Virgo. This is a preliminary, approximate figure: the longitude will shortly be corrected. Now the tail of Leo31 is at 16\u00b0 4\u2019 Virgo, with latitude 12\u00b0 18\u2019 North, and Mars was found to be 8\u00b0 17\u2019 distant from the Tail. What is sought is the distance of its parallel from the Tail, since the difference in longitude is 1\u00b0 45\u2019. Dividing the secant of 8\u00b0 17\u2019 by the secant of 1\u00b0 45\u2019 gives the secant of 8\u00b0 6\u2019, the arc sought. This subtracted from the fixed star\u2019s northern latitude of 12\u00b0 18\u2019 leaves Mars\u2019s latitude, 4\u00b0 12\u2019 north. This I now take as determined, and compare it with the latitudes of the fixed stars according to the laws of trigonometry. From the Wing of Virgo, I find Mars\u2019s longitude to be 14\u00b0 19\u2019 Virgo; from the Neck of Leo, 14\u00b0 23\u2019 36\u201c. The mean of these two is 14\u00b0 21\u2019 18\u201c Virgo. And since the sextant gave distances larger than the truth, the latitude would come out at 4\u00b0 14\u2019 north.\nOn the night following February 23, at 12h, he observed Mars in relation to five fixed stars: the Tail of Leo and Arcturus for latitude, and for the longitude, in the first instance, Spica (which followed it), and, in the second, the Neck of Leo and Cor Leonis (which preceded it).\nBy a rough estimate, I foresee that Mars is going to fall at 11\u00bc\u00b0 Virgo. It was found to be 9\u00b0 24\u2019 from the Tail of Leo, and hence, its latitude comes out at 4\u00b0 6\u2019 ^32. And now, through this and the latitudes of the fixed stars, together with their distances (17\u00b0 26\u2019 from Regulus, 17\u00b0 51\u2019 from the Neck of Leo, 37\u00b0 28\u2019 from Spica, 44\u00b0 15\u2019 from Arcturus), Mars\u2019s position comes out at 11\u00b0 21\u2019 23\u201c Virgo (from Regulus), 11\u00b0 20\u2019 52\u201c Virgo (from the Neck of Leo), and 11\u00b0 17\u2019 40\u201c (from Spica). Again (as you see) the distances err in being too great. For from the Heart and the Neck [of Leo], Mars is pushed a little eastward, and from Spica and Arcturus a little westward, and more from Arcturus, owing to its greater northern latitude ^33. The mean (ignoring Arcturus), 11\u00b0 19\u2019 20\u201c Virgo, is very nearly true. Also, the latitude is greater, namely, 4\u00b0 7\u2019 40\u201c north. Now from February 15 at 17h to 23 February at 12h, a period of 7 days 19 hours, Mars moved 3\u00b0 0\u2019: 180 minutes in 187 hours. That is, about one minute per hour. And if you wish to take it into account, the parallax (if any) is subtracted from the longitude on February 16 and a little is added on February 23.\n Because the last observation follows the time of observation found by me by 2 days 21 hours 47 min., add the motion corresponding to this time, 1\u00b0 7\u2019: the position will come out 12\u00b0 26\u2019 Virgo. The agreement is thus very good\u2014it could not be better\u2014given that both of us [that is, Kepler and Fabricius] work independently and do not rely on the facilities used by Tycho Brahe.","1761":"VIII. On 1595 October 30 at 8h 20m, the planet was found at 17\u00b0 47\u2019 15\u201c Taurus,19 not far from the nonagesimal. We may thus be sure of the parallax, although we must take it into account. The latitude was 0\u00b0 5\u2019 10\u201c north. The sun\u2019s position was 16\u00b0 50\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio. The distance between the stars was 56\u2019 45\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 35\u201c; that of Mars, 22\u2019 54\u201c, as appears by comparing the nearby observations. The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 23\u2019 29\u201c. If the distance between the stars be divided by this, it comes out to 40\u2019 47\u201c of a day, or 16 hours 19 min. Therefore, the true opposition was 0h 39m PM on October 31. Mars\u2019s position was 17\u00b0 31\u2019 40\u201c Taurus. This needs no reduction to the orbit, as it is nearly at the node. The latitude was about 0\u00b0 8\u2019 north. But comparison with the preceding and following days shows a latitude of about 5\u2019 north.\nIX. Let, at any rate, Mars\u2019s position on 1597 December 10 at 8h 30m be 3\u00b0 45\u00bd\u2019 Cancer (as above) ^20. The sun\u2019s position was 29\u00b0 4\u2019 53\u201c Sagittarius. The distance between the stars was 4\u00b0 40\u2019 37\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 61\u2019 20\u201c, that of Mars 23\u2019 40\u201c (for in 1580 the diurnal motion in Gemini was 23\u2019, and in 1582, at 17\u00b0 Cancer, it was 24\u2019). Therefore, the sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 25\u2019 0\u201c. These data show that the time of true opposition followed 3 days 7 hours 14 min. later, on December 14 at 3h 44m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 2\u00b0 27\u2153\u2019 Cancer. The reduction to the orbit (quite ridiculous here, since the observation itself has an uncertainty of several minutes) requires the addition of about 52\u201c. Therefore, the corrected position was 2\u00b0 28\u2019 Cancer. The latitude, from the table, was 3\u00b0 33\u2019 north.\nOn the same night, the one following December 10, at 12\u2159h, Fabricius in East Frisia found Mars\u2019s position to be 3\u00b0 40\u00bc\u2019 Cancer with latitude 3\u00b0 23\u2019 N. In this observation the longitude comes out nearly the same. For the motion over 3h 40m is 3\u00bd\u2019, so that in the Brahean observation too, at 12\u2159h Mars could have been at 3\u00b0 42\u2019 Cancer\u2014two minutes beyond the Fabrician position.\nX. On 1600 January 13\/23 at 11h 40m, the time being adjusted to Uraniborg time, the planet was observed at 10\u00b0 38\u2019 46\u201c Leo ^21. The sun\u2019s position was 3\u00b0 26\u2019 30\u201c Aquarius. The stars were 7\u00b0 12\u2019 16\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion for the next few days was 1\u00b0 1\u2019 3\u201c; that of Mars, 23\u2019 44\u201c. The sum: 1\u00b0 24\u2019 47\u201c. The opposition therefore followed 5 days 2h 22m after; that is, on January 19\/29 at 2h 2m in the morning, before dawn. Mars was at 8\u00b0 38\u2019 Leo. There is no need for reduction, since it is near the limit. The latitude, from the table, was 4\u00b0 30\u2019 50\u201c N.\nXI. On the evening of 1602 Febr. 18\/28 at 10h 30m, using the Tychonic  instruments (with the help of the learned Matthias Seiffard,22 bequeathed us by Tycho), I took the distance of Mars from the middle star of the tail of Ursa Major 23 to be 52\u00b0 22\u2019. And since the distance between Cor Leonis and Procyon was 37\u00b0 22\u2019 20\u201c, which should have been 37\u00b0 19\u2019 50\u201c,24 we know that the sextant reads 2\u00bd minutes high. Therefore, the corrected distance of Mars from the tail of Ursa was 52\u00b0 19\u00bd\u2019. And since the latitude of the fixed star is 56\u00b0 22\u2019, the remainder, by subtraction, is 4\u00b0 2\u00bd\u2019\u2014supposing that Mars was at precisely the same longitude as the fixed star. But because there was a difference of 3\u00be degrees between them (as is clear from the following observations), a slight correction is required.\n For let AB be 3\u00b0 43\u2019 30\u201c on a parallel close to the ecliptic, B Mars, C the fixed star, and BC 52\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c. Dividing the secant of BC by the secant of AB gives the  secant of CA, 52\u00b0 14\u2019, which, subtracted from 56\u00b0 22\u2019 (the latitude of the fixed star) leaves 4\u00b0 8\u2019 north as Mars\u2019s observed latitude. At the same time, we found 19\u00b0 23\u2019 between Mars and Cor Leonis (19\u00b0 20\u00bd corrected), and 21\u00b0 20\u2019 between Mars and the bright star in the wing of Virgo25 (21\u00b0 17\u00bd\u2019 corrected). From these two distances (using the latitudes of the stars and Mars), Mars\u2019s longitude is found to be 13\u00b0 19\u2019 6\u201c Virgo, by consensus of all measurements.\nAlternatively, the meridian altitude of Mars was found at 12h 40m, using two quadrants, to be 50\u00b0 19\u2019, while the tail of Leo26 was 56\u00b0 45\u2019. Therefore, from the declinations and right ascensions of the fixed stars and our distances, Mars\u2019s position is determined as 13\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c Virgo, latitude 4\u00b0 7\u2019 55\u201c ^27. This is the Tychonic procedure. I have included the other for the sake of showing a consensus, and also that it might be evident that despite the lack of absolute perfection in the demonstration, short cuts either in computation or in our understanding can under certain circumstances be applied. For in that previous procedure there is less in the actual work than in the reporting of it. At Prague, 5\u00b0 Scorpio was rising ^28. Therefore, the nonagesimal was about 32\u00bd\u00b0 from the zenith. And since Mars\u2019s distance from the earth was rather more than half the sun\u2019s distance, the resulting parallax of about 5\u2019 opposite 32\u00bd\u00b0 in our parallactic table, shows a latitudinal parallax of 2\u2019 41\u201c. Thus the latitude as seen from the middle of the earth would be 4\u00b0 10\u2154\u2019 north. And because the altitude of the nonagesimal was 57\u00bd\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax at the horizon was 4\u2019 13\u201c. But since Mars was 38\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, the longitudinal parallax corresponding to this position is 2\u2019 36\u201c, and if this be eliminated, Mars would be placed at about 13\u00b0 18\u2019 Virgo ^29. At that moment, the sun\u2019s position was 10\u00b0 16\u2019 42\u201c Pisces. The distance between the bodies was 3\u00b0 1\u2019 18\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 4\u201c, and that of Mars, 24\u2019 5\u201c (for it was 24\u2019 18\u201c at 21\u00b0 Leo in 1585, and 24\u2019 at 26 Virgo in 1587). The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 24\u2019 9\u201c. The true opposition therefore followed 2 days 3 hours 43 minutes later, on 21 February\/3 March before dawn at 2h 13m, Mars being at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 35\u201c Virgo. Forty seconds must be subtracted to reduce the position to the orbit, putting Mars at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 Virgo, with slightly less latitude than before, since the latitude was then decreasing. It was therefore about 4\u00b0 10\u2019, or 4\u00b0 7\u2153\u2019 if the parallax be neglected.\n But because, since Tycho\u2019s death, we have not made frequent observations nor continued them over several days, it would be best, for certainty\u2019s sake, also to make use of those observations which David Fabricius of East Frisia, a sedulous practitioner of astronomy, has communicated to me.\nOn February 16, old style, at 5h in the morning, he took the planet\u2019s distances from the tail of Leo (for the latitude), from the neck of Leo,30 and, on the other hand, from the bright star in the southern wing of Virgo, so as to check its longitude by working it out twice.\nI could make use of Tycho\u2019s line of reasoning, which he routinely adopted in volume I of the Progymnasmata when (as here) the declination of the planet was not known. But because that method extends to ten operations, I prefer for the sake of brevity to proceed as I did before with my own observations. Here there are no hidden dangers.\nFirst, the star in the wing of Virgo, adjusted to our time, is at 4\u00b0 36\u2019 30\u201c Libra with latitude 2\u00b0 50\u2019 north. Fabricius found that Mars is 20\u00b0 18\u2019 westward from it on the zodiac, which puts Mars at about 14\u00b0 18\u2019 30\u201c Virgo. This is a preliminary, approximate figure: the longitude will shortly be corrected. Now the tail of Leo31 is at 16\u00b0 4\u2019 Virgo, with latitude 12\u00b0 18\u2019 North, and Mars was found to be 8\u00b0 17\u2019 distant from the Tail. What is sought is the distance of its parallel from the Tail, since the difference in longitude is 1\u00b0 45\u2019. Dividing the secant of 8\u00b0 17\u2019 by the secant of 1\u00b0 45\u2019 gives the secant of 8\u00b0 6\u2019, the arc sought. This subtracted from the fixed star\u2019s northern latitude of 12\u00b0 18\u2019 leaves Mars\u2019s latitude, 4\u00b0 12\u2019 north. This I now take as determined, and compare it with the latitudes of the fixed stars according to the laws of trigonometry. From the Wing of Virgo, I find Mars\u2019s longitude to be 14\u00b0 19\u2019 Virgo; from the Neck of Leo, 14\u00b0 23\u2019 36\u201c. The mean of these two is 14\u00b0 21\u2019 18\u201c Virgo. And since the sextant gave distances larger than the truth, the latitude would come out at 4\u00b0 14\u2019 north.\nOn the night following February 23, at 12h, he observed Mars in relation to five fixed stars: the Tail of Leo and Arcturus for latitude, and for the longitude, in the first instance, Spica (which followed it), and, in the second, the Neck of Leo and Cor Leonis (which preceded it).\nBy a rough estimate, I foresee that Mars is going to fall at 11\u00bc\u00b0 Virgo. It was found to be 9\u00b0 24\u2019 from the Tail of Leo, and hence, its latitude comes out at 4\u00b0 6\u2019 ^32. And now, through this and the latitudes of the fixed stars, together with their distances (17\u00b0 26\u2019 from Regulus, 17\u00b0 51\u2019 from the Neck of Leo, 37\u00b0 28\u2019 from Spica, 44\u00b0 15\u2019 from Arcturus), Mars\u2019s position comes out at 11\u00b0 21\u2019 23\u201c Virgo (from Regulus), 11\u00b0 20\u2019 52\u201c Virgo (from the Neck of Leo), and 11\u00b0 17\u2019 40\u201c (from Spica). Again (as you see) the distances err in being too great. For from the Heart and the Neck [of Leo], Mars is pushed a little eastward, and from Spica and Arcturus a little westward, and more from Arcturus, owing to its greater northern latitude ^33. The mean (ignoring Arcturus), 11\u00b0 19\u2019 20\u201c Virgo, is very nearly true. Also, the latitude is greater, namely, 4\u00b0 7\u2019 40\u201c north. Now from February 15 at 17h to 23 February at 12h, a period of 7 days 19 hours, Mars moved 3\u00b0 0\u2019: 180 minutes in 187 hours. That is, about one minute per hour. And if you wish to take it into account, the parallax (if any) is subtracted from the longitude on February 16 and a little is added on February 23.\n Because the last observation follows the time of observation found by me by 2 days 21 hours 47 min., add the motion corresponding to this time, 1\u00b0 7\u2019: the position will come out 12\u00b0 26\u2019 Virgo. The agreement is thus very good\u2014it could not be better\u2014given that both of us [that is, Kepler and Fabricius] work independently and do not rely on the facilities used by Tycho Brahe.","1762":"VIII. On 1595 October 30 at 8h 20m, the planet was found at 17\u00b0 47\u2019 15\u201c Taurus,19 not far from the nonagesimal. We may thus be sure of the parallax, although we must take it into account. The latitude was 0\u00b0 5\u2019 10\u201c north. The sun\u2019s position was 16\u00b0 50\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio. The distance between the stars was 56\u2019 45\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 35\u201c; that of Mars, 22\u2019 54\u201c, as appears by comparing the nearby observations. The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 23\u2019 29\u201c. If the distance between the stars be divided by this, it comes out to 40\u2019 47\u201c of a day, or 16 hours 19 min. Therefore, the true opposition was 0h 39m PM on October 31. Mars\u2019s position was 17\u00b0 31\u2019 40\u201c Taurus. This needs no reduction to the orbit, as it is nearly at the node. The latitude was about 0\u00b0 8\u2019 north. But comparison with the preceding and following days shows a latitude of about 5\u2019 north.\nIX. Let, at any rate, Mars\u2019s position on 1597 December 10 at 8h 30m be 3\u00b0 45\u00bd\u2019 Cancer (as above) ^20. The sun\u2019s position was 29\u00b0 4\u2019 53\u201c Sagittarius. The distance between the stars was 4\u00b0 40\u2019 37\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 61\u2019 20\u201c, that of Mars 23\u2019 40\u201c (for in 1580 the diurnal motion in Gemini was 23\u2019, and in 1582, at 17\u00b0 Cancer, it was 24\u2019). Therefore, the sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 25\u2019 0\u201c. These data show that the time of true opposition followed 3 days 7 hours 14 min. later, on December 14 at 3h 44m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 2\u00b0 27\u2153\u2019 Cancer. The reduction to the orbit (quite ridiculous here, since the observation itself has an uncertainty of several minutes) requires the addition of about 52\u201c. Therefore, the corrected position was 2\u00b0 28\u2019 Cancer. The latitude, from the table, was 3\u00b0 33\u2019 north.\nOn the same night, the one following December 10, at 12\u2159h, Fabricius in East Frisia found Mars\u2019s position to be 3\u00b0 40\u00bc\u2019 Cancer with latitude 3\u00b0 23\u2019 N. In this observation the longitude comes out nearly the same. For the motion over 3h 40m is 3\u00bd\u2019, so that in the Brahean observation too, at 12\u2159h Mars could have been at 3\u00b0 42\u2019 Cancer\u2014two minutes beyond the Fabrician position.\nX. On 1600 January 13\/23 at 11h 40m, the time being adjusted to Uraniborg time, the planet was observed at 10\u00b0 38\u2019 46\u201c Leo ^21. The sun\u2019s position was 3\u00b0 26\u2019 30\u201c Aquarius. The stars were 7\u00b0 12\u2019 16\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion for the next few days was 1\u00b0 1\u2019 3\u201c; that of Mars, 23\u2019 44\u201c. The sum: 1\u00b0 24\u2019 47\u201c. The opposition therefore followed 5 days 2h 22m after; that is, on January 19\/29 at 2h 2m in the morning, before dawn. Mars was at 8\u00b0 38\u2019 Leo. There is no need for reduction, since it is near the limit. The latitude, from the table, was 4\u00b0 30\u2019 50\u201c N.\nXI. On the evening of 1602 Febr. 18\/28 at 10h 30m, using the Tychonic  instruments (with the help of the learned Matthias Seiffard,22 bequeathed us by Tycho), I took the distance of Mars from the middle star of the tail of Ursa Major 23 to be 52\u00b0 22\u2019. And since the distance between Cor Leonis and Procyon was 37\u00b0 22\u2019 20\u201c, which should have been 37\u00b0 19\u2019 50\u201c,24 we know that the sextant reads 2\u00bd minutes high. Therefore, the corrected distance of Mars from the tail of Ursa was 52\u00b0 19\u00bd\u2019. And since the latitude of the fixed star is 56\u00b0 22\u2019, the remainder, by subtraction, is 4\u00b0 2\u00bd\u2019\u2014supposing that Mars was at precisely the same longitude as the fixed star. But because there was a difference of 3\u00be degrees between them (as is clear from the following observations), a slight correction is required.\n For let AB be 3\u00b0 43\u2019 30\u201c on a parallel close to the ecliptic, B Mars, C the fixed star, and BC 52\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c. Dividing the secant of BC by the secant of AB gives the  secant of CA, 52\u00b0 14\u2019, which, subtracted from 56\u00b0 22\u2019 (the latitude of the fixed star) leaves 4\u00b0 8\u2019 north as Mars\u2019s observed latitude. At the same time, we found 19\u00b0 23\u2019 between Mars and Cor Leonis (19\u00b0 20\u00bd corrected), and 21\u00b0 20\u2019 between Mars and the bright star in the wing of Virgo25 (21\u00b0 17\u00bd\u2019 corrected). From these two distances (using the latitudes of the stars and Mars), Mars\u2019s longitude is found to be 13\u00b0 19\u2019 6\u201c Virgo, by consensus of all measurements.\nAlternatively, the meridian altitude of Mars was found at 12h 40m, using two quadrants, to be 50\u00b0 19\u2019, while the tail of Leo26 was 56\u00b0 45\u2019. Therefore, from the declinations and right ascensions of the fixed stars and our distances, Mars\u2019s position is determined as 13\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c Virgo, latitude 4\u00b0 7\u2019 55\u201c ^27. This is the Tychonic procedure. I have included the other for the sake of showing a consensus, and also that it might be evident that despite the lack of absolute perfection in the demonstration, short cuts either in computation or in our understanding can under certain circumstances be applied. For in that previous procedure there is less in the actual work than in the reporting of it. At Prague, 5\u00b0 Scorpio was rising ^28. Therefore, the nonagesimal was about 32\u00bd\u00b0 from the zenith. And since Mars\u2019s distance from the earth was rather more than half the sun\u2019s distance, the resulting parallax of about 5\u2019 opposite 32\u00bd\u00b0 in our parallactic table, shows a latitudinal parallax of 2\u2019 41\u201c. Thus the latitude as seen from the middle of the earth would be 4\u00b0 10\u2154\u2019 north. And because the altitude of the nonagesimal was 57\u00bd\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax at the horizon was 4\u2019 13\u201c. But since Mars was 38\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, the longitudinal parallax corresponding to this position is 2\u2019 36\u201c, and if this be eliminated, Mars would be placed at about 13\u00b0 18\u2019 Virgo ^29. At that moment, the sun\u2019s position was 10\u00b0 16\u2019 42\u201c Pisces. The distance between the bodies was 3\u00b0 1\u2019 18\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 4\u201c, and that of Mars, 24\u2019 5\u201c (for it was 24\u2019 18\u201c at 21\u00b0 Leo in 1585, and 24\u2019 at 26 Virgo in 1587). The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 24\u2019 9\u201c. The true opposition therefore followed 2 days 3 hours 43 minutes later, on 21 February\/3 March before dawn at 2h 13m, Mars being at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 35\u201c Virgo. Forty seconds must be subtracted to reduce the position to the orbit, putting Mars at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 Virgo, with slightly less latitude than before, since the latitude was then decreasing. It was therefore about 4\u00b0 10\u2019, or 4\u00b0 7\u2153\u2019 if the parallax be neglected.\n But because, since Tycho\u2019s death, we have not made frequent observations nor continued them over several days, it would be best, for certainty\u2019s sake, also to make use of those observations which David Fabricius of East Frisia, a sedulous practitioner of astronomy, has communicated to me.\nOn February 16, old style, at 5h in the morning, he took the planet\u2019s distances from the tail of Leo (for the latitude), from the neck of Leo,30 and, on the other hand, from the bright star in the southern wing of Virgo, so as to check its longitude by working it out twice.\nI could make use of Tycho\u2019s line of reasoning, which he routinely adopted in volume I of the Progymnasmata when (as here) the declination of the planet was not known. But because that method extends to ten operations, I prefer for the sake of brevity to proceed as I did before with my own observations. Here there are no hidden dangers.\nFirst, the star in the wing of Virgo, adjusted to our time, is at 4\u00b0 36\u2019 30\u201c Libra with latitude 2\u00b0 50\u2019 north. Fabricius found that Mars is 20\u00b0 18\u2019 westward from it on the zodiac, which puts Mars at about 14\u00b0 18\u2019 30\u201c Virgo. This is a preliminary, approximate figure: the longitude will shortly be corrected. Now the tail of Leo31 is at 16\u00b0 4\u2019 Virgo, with latitude 12\u00b0 18\u2019 North, and Mars was found to be 8\u00b0 17\u2019 distant from the Tail. What is sought is the distance of its parallel from the Tail, since the difference in longitude is 1\u00b0 45\u2019. Dividing the secant of 8\u00b0 17\u2019 by the secant of 1\u00b0 45\u2019 gives the secant of 8\u00b0 6\u2019, the arc sought. This subtracted from the fixed star\u2019s northern latitude of 12\u00b0 18\u2019 leaves Mars\u2019s latitude, 4\u00b0 12\u2019 north. This I now take as determined, and compare it with the latitudes of the fixed stars according to the laws of trigonometry. From the Wing of Virgo, I find Mars\u2019s longitude to be 14\u00b0 19\u2019 Virgo; from the Neck of Leo, 14\u00b0 23\u2019 36\u201c. The mean of these two is 14\u00b0 21\u2019 18\u201c Virgo. And since the sextant gave distances larger than the truth, the latitude would come out at 4\u00b0 14\u2019 north.\nOn the night following February 23, at 12h, he observed Mars in relation to five fixed stars: the Tail of Leo and Arcturus for latitude, and for the longitude, in the first instance, Spica (which followed it), and, in the second, the Neck of Leo and Cor Leonis (which preceded it).\nBy a rough estimate, I foresee that Mars is going to fall at 11\u00bc\u00b0 Virgo. It was found to be 9\u00b0 24\u2019 from the Tail of Leo, and hence, its latitude comes out at 4\u00b0 6\u2019 ^32. And now, through this and the latitudes of the fixed stars, together with their distances (17\u00b0 26\u2019 from Regulus, 17\u00b0 51\u2019 from the Neck of Leo, 37\u00b0 28\u2019 from Spica, 44\u00b0 15\u2019 from Arcturus), Mars\u2019s position comes out at 11\u00b0 21\u2019 23\u201c Virgo (from Regulus), 11\u00b0 20\u2019 52\u201c Virgo (from the Neck of Leo), and 11\u00b0 17\u2019 40\u201c (from Spica). Again (as you see) the distances err in being too great. For from the Heart and the Neck [of Leo], Mars is pushed a little eastward, and from Spica and Arcturus a little westward, and more from Arcturus, owing to its greater northern latitude ^33. The mean (ignoring Arcturus), 11\u00b0 19\u2019 20\u201c Virgo, is very nearly true. Also, the latitude is greater, namely, 4\u00b0 7\u2019 40\u201c north. Now from February 15 at 17h to 23 February at 12h, a period of 7 days 19 hours, Mars moved 3\u00b0 0\u2019: 180 minutes in 187 hours. That is, about one minute per hour. And if you wish to take it into account, the parallax (if any) is subtracted from the longitude on February 16 and a little is added on February 23.\n Because the last observation follows the time of observation found by me by 2 days 21 hours 47 min., add the motion corresponding to this time, 1\u00b0 7\u2019: the position will come out 12\u00b0 26\u2019 Virgo. The agreement is thus very good\u2014it could not be better\u2014given that both of us [that is, Kepler and Fabricius] work independently and do not rely on the facilities used by Tycho Brahe.","1763":"VIII. On 1595 October 30 at 8h 20m, the planet was found at 17\u00b0 47\u2019 15\u201c Taurus,19 not far from the nonagesimal. We may thus be sure of the parallax, although we must take it into account. The latitude was 0\u00b0 5\u2019 10\u201c north. The sun\u2019s position was 16\u00b0 50\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio. The distance between the stars was 56\u2019 45\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 35\u201c; that of Mars, 22\u2019 54\u201c, as appears by comparing the nearby observations. The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 23\u2019 29\u201c. If the distance between the stars be divided by this, it comes out to 40\u2019 47\u201c of a day, or 16 hours 19 min. Therefore, the true opposition was 0h 39m PM on October 31. Mars\u2019s position was 17\u00b0 31\u2019 40\u201c Taurus. This needs no reduction to the orbit, as it is nearly at the node. The latitude was about 0\u00b0 8\u2019 north. But comparison with the preceding and following days shows a latitude of about 5\u2019 north.\nIX. Let, at any rate, Mars\u2019s position on 1597 December 10 at 8h 30m be 3\u00b0 45\u00bd\u2019 Cancer (as above) ^20. The sun\u2019s position was 29\u00b0 4\u2019 53\u201c Sagittarius. The distance between the stars was 4\u00b0 40\u2019 37\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 61\u2019 20\u201c, that of Mars 23\u2019 40\u201c (for in 1580 the diurnal motion in Gemini was 23\u2019, and in 1582, at 17\u00b0 Cancer, it was 24\u2019). Therefore, the sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 25\u2019 0\u201c. These data show that the time of true opposition followed 3 days 7 hours 14 min. later, on December 14 at 3h 44m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 2\u00b0 27\u2153\u2019 Cancer. The reduction to the orbit (quite ridiculous here, since the observation itself has an uncertainty of several minutes) requires the addition of about 52\u201c. Therefore, the corrected position was 2\u00b0 28\u2019 Cancer. The latitude, from the table, was 3\u00b0 33\u2019 north.\nOn the same night, the one following December 10, at 12\u2159h, Fabricius in East Frisia found Mars\u2019s position to be 3\u00b0 40\u00bc\u2019 Cancer with latitude 3\u00b0 23\u2019 N. In this observation the longitude comes out nearly the same. For the motion over 3h 40m is 3\u00bd\u2019, so that in the Brahean observation too, at 12\u2159h Mars could have been at 3\u00b0 42\u2019 Cancer\u2014two minutes beyond the Fabrician position.\nX. On 1600 January 13\/23 at 11h 40m, the time being adjusted to Uraniborg time, the planet was observed at 10\u00b0 38\u2019 46\u201c Leo ^21. The sun\u2019s position was 3\u00b0 26\u2019 30\u201c Aquarius. The stars were 7\u00b0 12\u2019 16\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion for the next few days was 1\u00b0 1\u2019 3\u201c; that of Mars, 23\u2019 44\u201c. The sum: 1\u00b0 24\u2019 47\u201c. The opposition therefore followed 5 days 2h 22m after; that is, on January 19\/29 at 2h 2m in the morning, before dawn. Mars was at 8\u00b0 38\u2019 Leo. There is no need for reduction, since it is near the limit. The latitude, from the table, was 4\u00b0 30\u2019 50\u201c N.\nXI. On the evening of 1602 Febr. 18\/28 at 10h 30m, using the Tychonic  instruments (with the help of the learned Matthias Seiffard,22 bequeathed us by Tycho), I took the distance of Mars from the middle star of the tail of Ursa Major 23 to be 52\u00b0 22\u2019. And since the distance between Cor Leonis and Procyon was 37\u00b0 22\u2019 20\u201c, which should have been 37\u00b0 19\u2019 50\u201c,24 we know that the sextant reads 2\u00bd minutes high. Therefore, the corrected distance of Mars from the tail of Ursa was 52\u00b0 19\u00bd\u2019. And since the latitude of the fixed star is 56\u00b0 22\u2019, the remainder, by subtraction, is 4\u00b0 2\u00bd\u2019\u2014supposing that Mars was at precisely the same longitude as the fixed star. But because there was a difference of 3\u00be degrees between them (as is clear from the following observations), a slight correction is required.\n For let AB be 3\u00b0 43\u2019 30\u201c on a parallel close to the ecliptic, B Mars, C the fixed star, and BC 52\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c. Dividing the secant of BC by the secant of AB gives the  secant of CA, 52\u00b0 14\u2019, which, subtracted from 56\u00b0 22\u2019 (the latitude of the fixed star) leaves 4\u00b0 8\u2019 north as Mars\u2019s observed latitude. At the same time, we found 19\u00b0 23\u2019 between Mars and Cor Leonis (19\u00b0 20\u00bd corrected), and 21\u00b0 20\u2019 between Mars and the bright star in the wing of Virgo25 (21\u00b0 17\u00bd\u2019 corrected). From these two distances (using the latitudes of the stars and Mars), Mars\u2019s longitude is found to be 13\u00b0 19\u2019 6\u201c Virgo, by consensus of all measurements.\nAlternatively, the meridian altitude of Mars was found at 12h 40m, using two quadrants, to be 50\u00b0 19\u2019, while the tail of Leo26 was 56\u00b0 45\u2019. Therefore, from the declinations and right ascensions of the fixed stars and our distances, Mars\u2019s position is determined as 13\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c Virgo, latitude 4\u00b0 7\u2019 55\u201c ^27. This is the Tychonic procedure. I have included the other for the sake of showing a consensus, and also that it might be evident that despite the lack of absolute perfection in the demonstration, short cuts either in computation or in our understanding can under certain circumstances be applied. For in that previous procedure there is less in the actual work than in the reporting of it. At Prague, 5\u00b0 Scorpio was rising ^28. Therefore, the nonagesimal was about 32\u00bd\u00b0 from the zenith. And since Mars\u2019s distance from the earth was rather more than half the sun\u2019s distance, the resulting parallax of about 5\u2019 opposite 32\u00bd\u00b0 in our parallactic table, shows a latitudinal parallax of 2\u2019 41\u201c. Thus the latitude as seen from the middle of the earth would be 4\u00b0 10\u2154\u2019 north. And because the altitude of the nonagesimal was 57\u00bd\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax at the horizon was 4\u2019 13\u201c. But since Mars was 38\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, the longitudinal parallax corresponding to this position is 2\u2019 36\u201c, and if this be eliminated, Mars would be placed at about 13\u00b0 18\u2019 Virgo ^29. At that moment, the sun\u2019s position was 10\u00b0 16\u2019 42\u201c Pisces. The distance between the bodies was 3\u00b0 1\u2019 18\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 4\u201c, and that of Mars, 24\u2019 5\u201c (for it was 24\u2019 18\u201c at 21\u00b0 Leo in 1585, and 24\u2019 at 26 Virgo in 1587). The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 24\u2019 9\u201c. The true opposition therefore followed 2 days 3 hours 43 minutes later, on 21 February\/3 March before dawn at 2h 13m, Mars being at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 35\u201c Virgo. Forty seconds must be subtracted to reduce the position to the orbit, putting Mars at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 Virgo, with slightly less latitude than before, since the latitude was then decreasing. It was therefore about 4\u00b0 10\u2019, or 4\u00b0 7\u2153\u2019 if the parallax be neglected.\n But because, since Tycho\u2019s death, we have not made frequent observations nor continued them over several days, it would be best, for certainty\u2019s sake, also to make use of those observations which David Fabricius of East Frisia, a sedulous practitioner of astronomy, has communicated to me.\nOn February 16, old style, at 5h in the morning, he took the planet\u2019s distances from the tail of Leo (for the latitude), from the neck of Leo,30 and, on the other hand, from the bright star in the southern wing of Virgo, so as to check its longitude by working it out twice.\nI could make use of Tycho\u2019s line of reasoning, which he routinely adopted in volume I of the Progymnasmata when (as here) the declination of the planet was not known. But because that method extends to ten operations, I prefer for the sake of brevity to proceed as I did before with my own observations. Here there are no hidden dangers.\nFirst, the star in the wing of Virgo, adjusted to our time, is at 4\u00b0 36\u2019 30\u201c Libra with latitude 2\u00b0 50\u2019 north. Fabricius found that Mars is 20\u00b0 18\u2019 westward from it on the zodiac, which puts Mars at about 14\u00b0 18\u2019 30\u201c Virgo. This is a preliminary, approximate figure: the longitude will shortly be corrected. Now the tail of Leo31 is at 16\u00b0 4\u2019 Virgo, with latitude 12\u00b0 18\u2019 North, and Mars was found to be 8\u00b0 17\u2019 distant from the Tail. What is sought is the distance of its parallel from the Tail, since the difference in longitude is 1\u00b0 45\u2019. Dividing the secant of 8\u00b0 17\u2019 by the secant of 1\u00b0 45\u2019 gives the secant of 8\u00b0 6\u2019, the arc sought. This subtracted from the fixed star\u2019s northern latitude of 12\u00b0 18\u2019 leaves Mars\u2019s latitude, 4\u00b0 12\u2019 north. This I now take as determined, and compare it with the latitudes of the fixed stars according to the laws of trigonometry. From the Wing of Virgo, I find Mars\u2019s longitude to be 14\u00b0 19\u2019 Virgo; from the Neck of Leo, 14\u00b0 23\u2019 36\u201c. The mean of these two is 14\u00b0 21\u2019 18\u201c Virgo. And since the sextant gave distances larger than the truth, the latitude would come out at 4\u00b0 14\u2019 north.\nOn the night following February 23, at 12h, he observed Mars in relation to five fixed stars: the Tail of Leo and Arcturus for latitude, and for the longitude, in the first instance, Spica (which followed it), and, in the second, the Neck of Leo and Cor Leonis (which preceded it).\nBy a rough estimate, I foresee that Mars is going to fall at 11\u00bc\u00b0 Virgo. It was found to be 9\u00b0 24\u2019 from the Tail of Leo, and hence, its latitude comes out at 4\u00b0 6\u2019 ^32. And now, through this and the latitudes of the fixed stars, together with their distances (17\u00b0 26\u2019 from Regulus, 17\u00b0 51\u2019 from the Neck of Leo, 37\u00b0 28\u2019 from Spica, 44\u00b0 15\u2019 from Arcturus), Mars\u2019s position comes out at 11\u00b0 21\u2019 23\u201c Virgo (from Regulus), 11\u00b0 20\u2019 52\u201c Virgo (from the Neck of Leo), and 11\u00b0 17\u2019 40\u201c (from Spica). Again (as you see) the distances err in being too great. For from the Heart and the Neck [of Leo], Mars is pushed a little eastward, and from Spica and Arcturus a little westward, and more from Arcturus, owing to its greater northern latitude ^33. The mean (ignoring Arcturus), 11\u00b0 19\u2019 20\u201c Virgo, is very nearly true. Also, the latitude is greater, namely, 4\u00b0 7\u2019 40\u201c north. Now from February 15 at 17h to 23 February at 12h, a period of 7 days 19 hours, Mars moved 3\u00b0 0\u2019: 180 minutes in 187 hours. That is, about one minute per hour. And if you wish to take it into account, the parallax (if any) is subtracted from the longitude on February 16 and a little is added on February 23.\n Because the last observation follows the time of observation found by me by 2 days 21 hours 47 min., add the motion corresponding to this time, 1\u00b0 7\u2019: the position will come out 12\u00b0 26\u2019 Virgo. The agreement is thus very good\u2014it could not be better\u2014given that both of us [that is, Kepler and Fabricius] work independently and do not rely on the facilities used by Tycho Brahe.","1764":"As for the latitude, on the 16th it was 4\u00b0 12\u2019, and on the 23rd it was 4\u00b0 7\u2154\u2019. It is therefore fitting to set it at 4\u00b0 9\u2019 on the 21st, which comes between the other two dates. Correction for parallax makes it somewhat greater. And I, too, was putting it at a little less than 4\u00b0 10\u2154\u2019, or 4\u00b0 10\u2019.","1765":"As for the latitude, on the 16th it was 4\u00b0 12\u2019, and on the 23rd it was 4\u00b0 7\u2154\u2019.

Finally, in 1604, when I had published my previously written Ephemerides, in which on the night between March 29 and 30\/April 8 and 9 the planet was placed on a line from Arcturus to Spica, that very thing appeared. For on the evening of April 8 it was slightly east of that line, but already on April 9 it was to the west. At that time, with the help of Johann Schuler and using Hofmann\u2019s sextant, I found 33\u00b0 4\u2019 between Arcturus and Spica, which ought to have been 33\u00b0 1\u00bd\u2019. Therefore, the reading was 2\u00bd\u2019 too great. Immediately after, between Arcturus and Mars there was 29\u00b0 43\u00bd\u2019; therefore, correctly, 29\u00b0 41\u2019. And since the latitude of Arcturus is 31\u00b0 2\u00bd\u2019 north, this left 2\u00b0 21\u00bd\u2019 as the latitude of Mars ^34. There was then 54\u00b0 8\u00bd\u2019 between Cor Leonis and Mars, and at the same time, the same amount between Cor Leonis and Spica. This should, however, have been 54\u00b0 2\u2019. There were therefore 6\u00bd minutes too much, while before the excess was only 2\u00bd\u2019. The origin of this uncertainty of four minutes could not be ascribed to the intervention of obstacles, as we were unable to eliminate it while observing. But let us suppose that, as before, the excess was 2\u00bd\u2019, making the distance between Mars and Cor Leonis 54\u00b0 6\u2019. The error could then be in Spica\u2019s position, possibly because Mars was mistaken for Spica, since they were close to one another. Hence, Mars\u2019s latitude comes out to 2\u00b0 21\u00bd\u2019, longitude 18\u00b0 25\u2019 Libra. The hour is known since, at the time of observation, the Back of Leo was culminating, whose right ascension is 163\u00b0 13\u2019.

Hence the difference in ascensions is 145\u00b0 45\u2019, which resolves into 9 hours 43 min. The rising point was 22\u00bd\u00b0 Scorpio. Therefore, the nonagesimal was 39\u00b0 from the zenith, and the distance of Mars from the earth was a little greater than half that of the sun from the earth. So the parallax was about 5\u00bd\u2019, and its latitudinal part, 3\u2019 28\u201c. Therefore the latitude without parallax was 2\u00b0 25\u2019 (whether this correction was rightly made, we shall consider below). And because the altitude of the nonagesimal was 51\u00b0, and Mars\u2019s distance from the nonagesimal was 56\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax was 3\u2019 32\u201c. Therefore, Mars would be at 18\u00b0 21\u00bd\u2019 Libra ^35. At our chosen moment, the sun\u2019s position is 19\u00b0 20\u2019 8\u201c Aries. The two celestial bodies are 58\u00bd\u2019 apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion is 58\u2019 38\u201c, and that of Mars, 22\u2019 36\u201c. (For in 1587 in Virgo it is 24\u2019, and in 1589 at 4\u00b0 Scorpio it is 22\u2019 8\u201c). The sum of the diurnal motions is 1\u00b0 21\u2019 14\u201c.

Therefore, Mars would be at 18\u00b0 21\u00bd\u2019 Libra ^35. At our chosen moment, the sun\u2019s position is 19\u00b0 20\u2019 8\u201c Aries. The two celestial bodies are 58\u00bd\u2019 apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion is 58\u2019 38\u201c, and that of Mars, 22\u2019 36\u201c. (For in 1587 in Virgo it is 24\u2019, and in 1589 at 4\u00b0 Scorpio it is 22\u2019 8\u201c). The sum of the diurnal motions is 1\u00b0 21\u2019 14\u201c. From all these beginnings, it follows that the true opposition preceded the observation by 17 hours 20 min., namely, on 29 March\/8 April at 4h 23m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 18\u00b0 37\u2019 50\u201c Libra. For reduction to the orbit, subtract about 39 sec., making Mars\u2019s position 18\u00b0 37\u2019 10\u201c Libra. The latitude was slightly greater than 2\u00b0 25\u2019, but, when parallax is ignored, it is 2\u00b0 22\u2019 north.","1773":"XII. Finally, in 1604, when I had published my previously written Ephemerides, in which on the night between March 29 and 30\/April 8 and 9 the planet was placed on a line from Arcturus to Spica, that very thing appeared. For on the evening of April 8 it was slightly east of that line, but already on April 9 it was to the west. At that time, with the help of Johann Schuler and using Hofmann\u2019s sextant, I found 33\u00b0 4\u2019 between Arcturus and Spica, which ought to have been 33\u00b0 1\u00bd\u2019. Therefore, the reading was 2\u00bd\u2019 too great. Immediately after, between Arcturus and Mars there was 29\u00b0 43\u00bd\u2019; therefore, correctly, 29\u00b0 41\u2019. And since the latitude of Arcturus is 31\u00b0 2\u00bd\u2019 north, this left 2\u00b0 21\u00bd\u2019 as the latitude of Mars ^34. There was then 54\u00b0 8\u00bd\u2019 between Cor Leonis and Mars, and at the same time, the same amount between Cor Leonis and Spica. This should, however, have been 54\u00b0 2\u2019. There were therefore 6\u00bd minutes too much, while before the excess was only 2\u00bd\u2019. The origin of this uncertainty of four minutes could not be ascribed to the intervention of obstacles, as we were unable to eliminate it while observing. But let us suppose that, as before, the excess was 2\u00bd\u2019, making the distance between Mars and Cor Leonis 54\u00b0 6\u2019. The error could then be in Spica\u2019s position, possibly because Mars was mistaken for Spica, since they were close to one another. Hence, Mars\u2019s latitude comes out to 2\u00b0 21\u00bd\u2019, longitude 18\u00b0 25\u2019 Libra. The hour is known since, at the time of observation, the Back of Leo was culminating, whose right ascension is 163\u00b0 13\u2019. Now the sun\u2019s position at noon is 18\u00b0 56\u2019 24\u201c Aries, whose right ascension is 17\u00b0 27\u2019 55\u201c. Hence the difference in ascensions is 145\u00b0 45\u2019, which resolves into 9 hours 43 min. The rising point was 22\u00bd\u00b0 Scorpio. Therefore, the nonagesimal was 39\u00b0 from the zenith, and the distance of Mars from the earth was a little greater than half that of the sun from the earth. So the parallax was about 5\u00bd\u2019, and its latitudinal part, 3\u2019 28\u201c. Therefore the latitude without parallax was 2\u00b0 25\u2019 (whether this correction was rightly made, we shall consider below).

There was then 54\u00b0 8\u00bd\u2019 between Cor Leonis and Mars, and at the same time, the same amount between Cor Leonis and Spica. This should, however, have been 54\u00b0 2\u2019. There were therefore 6\u00bd minutes too much, while before the excess was only 2\u00bd\u2019. The origin of this uncertainty of four minutes could not be ascribed to the intervention of obstacles, as we were unable to eliminate it while observing. But let us suppose that, as before, the excess was 2\u00bd\u2019, making the distance between Mars and Cor Leonis 54\u00b0 6\u2019. The error could then be in Spica\u2019s position, possibly because Mars was mistaken for Spica, since they were close to one another. Hence, Mars\u2019s latitude comes out to 2\u00b0 21\u00bd\u2019, longitude 18\u00b0 25\u2019 Libra. The hour is known since, at the time of observation, the Back of Leo was culminating, whose right ascension is 163\u00b0 13\u2019. Now the sun\u2019s position at noon is 18\u00b0 56\u2019 24\u201c Aries, whose right ascension is 17\u00b0 27\u2019 55\u201c. Hence the difference in ascensions is 145\u00b0 45\u2019, which resolves into 9 hours 43 min. The rising point was 22\u00bd\u00b0 Scorpio. Therefore, the nonagesimal was 39\u00b0 from the zenith, and the distance of Mars from the earth was a little greater than half that of the sun from the earth. So the parallax was about 5\u00bd\u2019, and its latitudinal part, 3\u2019 28\u201c. Therefore the latitude without parallax was 2\u00b0 25\u2019 (whether this correction was rightly made, we shall consider below). And because the altitude of the nonagesimal was 51\u00b0, and Mars\u2019s distance from the nonagesimal was 56\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax was 3\u2019 32\u201c. Therefore, Mars would be at 18\u00b0 21\u00bd\u2019 Libra ^35. At our chosen moment, the sun\u2019s position is 19\u00b0 20\u2019 8\u201c Aries. The two celestial bodies are 58\u00bd\u2019 apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion is 58\u2019 38\u201c, and that of Mars, 22\u2019 36\u201c. (For in 1587 in Virgo it is 24\u2019, and in 1589 at 4\u00b0 Scorpio it is 22\u2019 8\u201c). The sum of the diurnal motions is 1\u00b0 21\u2019 14\u201c. From all these beginnings, it follows that the true opposition preceded the observation by 17 hours 20 min., namely, on 29 March\/8 April at 4h 23m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 18\u00b0 37\u2019 50\u201c Libra. For reduction to the orbit, subtract about 39 sec., making Mars\u2019s position 18\u00b0 37\u2019 10\u201c Libra. The latitude was slightly greater than 2\u00b0 25\u2019, but, when parallax is ignored, it is 2\u00b0 22\u2019 north.","1779":"XII. Finally, in 1604, when I had published my previously written Ephemerides, in which on the night between March 29 and 30\/April 8 and 9 the planet was placed on a line from Arcturus to Spica, that very thing appeared. For on the evening of April 8 it was slightly east of that line, but already on April 9 it was to the west. At that time, with the help of Johann Schuler and using Hofmann\u2019s sextant, I found 33\u00b0 4\u2019 between Arcturus and Spica, which ought to have been 33\u00b0 1\u00bd\u2019.

The sun\u2019s diurnal motion is 58\u2019 38\u201c, and that of Mars, 22\u2019 36\u201c. (For in 1587 in Virgo it is 24\u2019, and in 1589 at 4\u00b0 Scorpio it is 22\u2019 8\u201c). The sum of the diurnal motions is 1\u00b0 21\u2019 14\u201c. From all these beginnings, it follows that the true opposition preceded the observation by 17 hours 20 min., namely, on 29 March\/8 April at 4h 23m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 18\u00b0 37\u2019 50\u201c Libra. For reduction to the orbit, subtract about 39 sec., making Mars\u2019s position 18\u00b0 37\u2019 10\u201c Libra. The latitude was slightly greater than 2\u00b0 25\u2019, but, when parallax is ignored, it is 2\u00b0 22\u2019 north.","1784":"XII. Finally, in 1604, when I had published my previously written Ephemerides, in which on the night between March 29 and 30\/April 8 and 9 the planet was placed on a line from Arcturus to Spica, that very thing appeared. For on the evening of April 8 it was slightly east of that line, but already on April 9 it was to the west. At that time, with the help of Johann Schuler and using Hofmann\u2019s sextant, I found 33\u00b0 4\u2019 between Arcturus and Spica, which ought to have been 33\u00b0 1\u00bd\u2019. Therefore, the reading was 2\u00bd\u2019 too great. Immediately after, between Arcturus and Mars there was 29\u00b0 43\u00bd\u2019; therefore, correctly, 29\u00b0 41\u2019. And since the latitude of Arcturus is 31\u00b0 2\u00bd\u2019 north, this left 2\u00b0 21\u00bd\u2019 as the latitude of Mars ^34. There was then 54\u00b0 8\u00bd\u2019 between Cor Leonis and Mars, and at the same time, the same amount between Cor Leonis and Spica. This should, however, have been 54\u00b0 2\u2019. There were therefore 6\u00bd minutes too much, while before the excess was only 2\u00bd\u2019. The origin of this uncertainty of four minutes could not be ascribed to the intervention of obstacles, as we were unable to eliminate it while observing. But let us suppose that, as before, the excess was 2\u00bd\u2019, making the distance between Mars and Cor Leonis 54\u00b0 6\u2019. The error could then be in Spica\u2019s position, possibly because Mars was mistaken for Spica, since they were close to one another. Hence, Mars\u2019s latitude comes out to 2\u00b0 21\u00bd\u2019, longitude 18\u00b0 25\u2019 Libra. The hour is known since, at the time of observation, the Back of Leo was culminating, whose right ascension is 163\u00b0 13\u2019. Now the sun\u2019s position at noon is 18\u00b0 56\u2019 24\u201c Aries, whose right ascension is 17\u00b0 27\u2019 55\u201c. Hence the difference in ascensions is 145\u00b0 45\u2019, which resolves into 9 hours 43 min. The rising point was 22\u00bd\u00b0 Scorpio. Therefore, the nonagesimal was 39\u00b0 from the zenith, and the distance of Mars from the earth was a little greater than half that of the sun from the earth. So the parallax was about 5\u00bd\u2019, and its latitudinal part, 3\u2019 28\u201c. Therefore the latitude without parallax was 2\u00b0 25\u2019 (whether this correction was rightly made, we shall consider below). And because the altitude of the nonagesimal was 51\u00b0, and Mars\u2019s distance from the nonagesimal was 56\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax was 3\u2019 32\u201c.

There were therefore 6\u00bd minutes too much, while before the excess was only 2\u00bd\u2019. The origin of this uncertainty of four minutes could not be ascribed to the intervention of obstacles, as we were unable to eliminate it while observing. But let us suppose that, as before, the excess was 2\u00bd\u2019, making the distance between Mars and Cor Leonis 54\u00b0 6\u2019. The error could then be in Spica\u2019s position, possibly because Mars was mistaken for Spica, since they were close to one another. Hence, Mars\u2019s latitude comes out to 2\u00b0 21\u00bd\u2019, longitude 18\u00b0 25\u2019 Libra. The hour is known since, at the time of observation, the Back of Leo was culminating, whose right ascension is 163\u00b0 13\u2019. Now the sun\u2019s position at noon is 18\u00b0 56\u2019 24\u201c Aries, whose right ascension is 17\u00b0 27\u2019 55\u201c. Hence the difference in ascensions is 145\u00b0 45\u2019, which resolves into 9 hours 43 min. The rising point was 22\u00bd\u00b0 Scorpio. Therefore, the nonagesimal was 39\u00b0 from the zenith, and the distance of Mars from the earth was a little greater than half that of the sun from the earth. So the parallax was about 5\u00bd\u2019, and its latitudinal part, 3\u2019 28\u201c. Therefore the latitude without parallax was 2\u00b0 25\u2019 (whether this correction was rightly made, we shall consider below). And because the altitude of the nonagesimal was 51\u00b0, and Mars\u2019s distance from the nonagesimal was 56\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax was 3\u2019 32\u201c. Therefore, Mars would be at 18\u00b0 21\u00bd\u2019 Libra ^35. At our chosen moment, the sun\u2019s position is 19\u00b0 20\u2019 8\u201c Aries. The two celestial bodies are 58\u00bd\u2019 apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion is 58\u2019 38\u201c, and that of Mars, 22\u2019 36\u201c. (For in 1587 in Virgo it is 24\u2019, and in 1589 at 4\u00b0 Scorpio it is 22\u2019 8\u201c). The sum of the diurnal motions is 1\u00b0 21\u2019 14\u201c. From all these beginnings, it follows that the true opposition preceded the observation by 17 hours 20 min., namely, on 29 March\/8 April at 4h 23m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 18\u00b0 37\u2019 50\u201c Libra. For reduction to the orbit, subtract about 39 sec., making Mars\u2019s position 18\u00b0 37\u2019 10\u201c Libra. The latitude was slightly greater than 2\u00b0 25\u2019, but, when parallax is ignored, it is 2\u00b0 22\u2019 north.","1790":"XII. Finally, in 1604, when I had published my previously written Ephemerides, in which on the night between March 29 and 30\/April 8 and 9 the planet was placed on a line from Arcturus to Spica, that very thing appeared. For on the evening of April 8 it was slightly east of that line, but already on April 9 it was to the west. At that time, with the help of Johann Schuler and using Hofmann\u2019s sextant, I found 33\u00b0 4\u2019 between Arcturus and Spica, which ought to have been 33\u00b0 1\u00bd\u2019. Therefore, the reading was 2\u00bd\u2019 too great. Immediately after, between Arcturus and Mars there was 29\u00b0 43\u00bd\u2019; therefore, correctly, 29\u00b0 41\u2019.

The sun\u2019s diurnal motion is 58\u2019 38\u201c, and that of Mars, 22\u2019 36\u201c. (For in 1587 in Virgo it is 24\u2019, and in 1589 at 4\u00b0 Scorpio it is 22\u2019 8\u201c). The sum of the diurnal motions is 1\u00b0 21\u2019 14\u201c. From all these beginnings, it follows that the true opposition preceded the observation by 17 hours 20 min., namely, on 29 March\/8 April at 4h 23m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 18\u00b0 37\u2019 50\u201c Libra. For reduction to the orbit, subtract about 39 sec., making Mars\u2019s position 18\u00b0 37\u2019 10\u201c Libra. The latitude was slightly greater than 2\u00b0 25\u2019, but, when parallax is ignored, it is 2\u00b0 22\u2019 north.","1795":"XII. Finally, in 1604, when I had published my previously written Ephemerides, in which on the night between March 29 and 30\/April 8 and 9 the planet was placed on a line from Arcturus to Spica, that very thing appeared. For on the evening of April 8 it was slightly east of that line, but already on April 9 it was to the west. At that time, with the help of Johann Schuler and using Hofmann\u2019s sextant, I found 33\u00b0 4\u2019 between Arcturus and Spica, which ought to have been 33\u00b0 1\u00bd\u2019. Therefore, the reading was 2\u00bd\u2019 too great. Immediately after, between Arcturus and Mars there was 29\u00b0 43\u00bd\u2019; therefore, correctly, 29\u00b0 41\u2019. And since the latitude of Arcturus is 31\u00b0 2\u00bd\u2019 north, this left 2\u00b0 21\u00bd\u2019 as the latitude of Mars ^34. There was then 54\u00b0 8\u00bd\u2019 between Cor Leonis and Mars, and at the same time, the same amount between Cor Leonis and Spica. This should, however, have been 54\u00b0 2\u2019. There were therefore 6\u00bd minutes too much, while before the excess was only 2\u00bd\u2019. The origin of this uncertainty of four minutes could not be ascribed to the intervention of obstacles, as we were unable to eliminate it while observing. But let us suppose that, as before, the excess was 2\u00bd\u2019, making the distance between Mars and Cor Leonis 54\u00b0 6\u2019. The error could then be in Spica\u2019s position, possibly because Mars was mistaken for Spica, since they were close to one another. Hence, Mars\u2019s latitude comes out to 2\u00b0 21\u00bd\u2019, longitude 18\u00b0 25\u2019 Libra. The hour is known since, at the time of observation, the Back of Leo was culminating, whose right ascension is 163\u00b0 13\u2019. Now the sun\u2019s position at noon is 18\u00b0 56\u2019 24\u201c Aries, whose right ascension is 17\u00b0 27\u2019 55\u201c. Hence the difference in ascensions is 145\u00b0 45\u2019, which resolves into 9 hours 43 min. The rising point was 22\u00bd\u00b0 Scorpio. Therefore, the nonagesimal was 39\u00b0 from the zenith, and the distance of Mars from the earth was a little greater than half that of the sun from the earth. So the parallax was about 5\u00bd\u2019, and its latitudinal part, 3\u2019 28\u201c. Therefore the latitude without parallax was 2\u00b0 25\u2019 (whether this correction was rightly made, we shall consider below). And because the altitude of the nonagesimal was 51\u00b0, and Mars\u2019s distance from the nonagesimal was 56\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax was 3\u2019 32\u201c.

And because BA is directed towards 5\u00bd\u00b0 Sagittarius, the direction of BC (by subtraction of the angle 123\u00b0 27\u2019) will be about 2\u00b0 3' Leo, for Ptolemy's time. Also at that time, the eccentricity of the equant, after transposition to the sun's true motion, was 18,353. I discovered this above by transposition of the Tychonic value, 18,342, with one change: for the size of Mars's orbit, instead of 151,386 I took 152,500, which is nearer the truth.

And because Ptolemy says in Book 13 Ch. 1 that Mars's northern limit is \"near the end of Cancer, and almost at its apogee,\"2 it will therefore be at 29 Cancer, that is, 3\u00bd\u00b0 before Cor Leonis. Despite this, in book 3 Ch. 6 Ptolemy put the northern limit exactly at the position of the apogee (25\u00bd\u00b0 Cancer) because it made calculations easier. And today it is at about 16\u00b0 20' Leo, about 7\u00b0 45' before Cor Leonis. By subtraction of 3\u00b0 30', the northern limit, and consequently the nodes, are found to have retrogressed 4\u00b0 15' from Cor Leonis.

And through A  let the straight line HL be drawn, lying in the plane of the earth's eccentric orb. Now let AH and AD be conceived as lying in the one plane of a circle of latitude, and likewise AL and AE. And let the earth in 1585 lie at B on line AH, and in 1593 let it be at the point C on line AL. Now AB and AD are directed toward 21\u00b0 Leo, so that the sun A seen from B appears at 21\u00b0 Aquarius. And on the other hand, E and C are at 12\u00b0 Pisces, so that the sun A seen from the earth C appears at 12\u00b0 Virgo. But 12\u00b0 Virgo is nearer to the sun's apogee than is 21\u00b0 Aquarius.

of Mars.","811":"It is true that a divine voice, which enjoins humans to study astronomy, is expressed in the world itself, not in words or syllables, but in things themselves and in the conformity of the human intellect and senses with the sequence of celestial bodies and of their dispositions.","812":"Nevertheless, a kind of fate also invisibly drives different individuals to take up different arts, and makes them certain that, just as they are a part of the work of creation, they likewise also partake to some extent in divine providence.","813":"When, in my early years, I was able to taste the sweetness of philosophy, I embraced the whole of it with an overwhelming desire, and with practically no special concern about astronomy.","814":"I certainly had enough intelligence, nor did I have any difficulty understanding the geometrical and astronomical topics included in the normal curriculum, aided as I was by figures, numbers, and proportions.","815":"These were, however, required courses, nothing that would bespeak an exceptional inclination towards astronomy.","816":"And since I was supported at the expense of the Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg, and saw my comrades, whom the Prince, upon request, kept trying to send to foreign countries, stalling in various ways out of love for their country, I, being hardier, quite maturely agreed with myself that whithersoever I was destined I would promptly go.","817":"The first to offer itself was an astronomical position; however, to tell the truth, I was driven forth to take it by the authority of my teachers.","818":"I was not frightened by the distance of the place, for (as I have just said) I had condemned this fear in others, but by the low opinion and contempt in which this kind of function is held, and the sparsity of erudition in this part of philosophy.","819":"I therefore entered upon this better furnished with wits than with knowledge, protesting loudly that I by no means gave over my right to follow another kind of life which seemed more splendid ^1.","820":"What came of those first two years of study may be seen in my Mysterium cosmographicum.","821":"The additional goads which my teacher Maestlin gave me towards embracing the rest of astronomy, you will read of in the same book, and in that man\u2019s prefatory letter to Rheticus\u2019s Narratio ^2.","822":"I had the very highest opinion of what I

uranic opus\u201d that spurred me on, as it was my","824":"own ardor to seek, through a reworking of astronomy, whether my discovery would support observations of complete accuracy.","825":"For it had then been demonstrated in that book that the discovery was consistent with the observations within the limits of accuracy of ordinary astronomy.","826":"So from that time I began to think seriously of comparing observations.","827":"In 1597, I wrote Tycho Brahe asking his opinion of my little book,3 and when he, in reply, mentioned (among other things) his own observations, he ignited in me an overwhelming desire to see them.","828":"Moreover, Tycho, who was indeed himself a large part of my destiny, did not cease from then on to invite me to come to him.","829":"And since I was frightened off by the distance of the place, I again ascribe it to divine arrangement that he came to Bohemia.","830":"I thereupon came to visit him at the beginning of 1600 in hopes of learning the correct eccentricities of the planets.","831":"But when I found out during the first week that, along with Ptolemy and Copernicus, he made use of the sun\u2019s mean motion, while the apparent motion would be more in accord with my little book (as is clear from the book itself), I begged the master to allow me to make use of the observations in my own manner.","832":"At that time, the work which his aide Christian Severinus4 had in hand was the theory of Mars.","833":"The occasion had placed this in his hands, in that they were busy with the observation of the acronychal position or opposition of Mars

that I arrived at the same time in which he was intent upon Mars, from whose motions alone we will have to come to a knowledge of the hidden secrets of astronomy, or remain forever ignorant of them ^5.","836":"A table of mean oppositions was worked out, starting with the year 1580.","837":"A hypothesis was invented which was proclaimed to represent all these oppositions within a distance of two minutes in longitude.","838":"(The numbers I used in Ch.","839":"5 were taken from among these, or differed from them only slightly.)","840":"The apogee at the beginning of the year 1585 was placed at 23\u00b0 45\u2019 Leo.","841":"The maximum eccentricity, made up of the semidiameters of the two small circles, was 20,160, in units of which the semidiameter of the greater epicycle was 16,380.","842":"Therefore, in the Ptolemaic form of the first inequality, the eccentricity of the equalizing point was 20,160 or a little less.","843":"From this hypothesis, a table of eccentric equations for individual degrees was constructed, as well as a table of the corrected mean motion, made by adding 1\u00be\u2019 to the mean motion of the Prutenic Tables ^6.","844":"These mean motions, apogees, and likewise the nodes, were extended over a period of forty years, exactly as was done for the solar and lunar motions in Book I of the Progymnasmata.","845":"It was only in the latitude at acronychal positions and also the parallax","846":"of the annual orb that Christian got stuck.","847":"There was, actually, a hypothesis and table for the latitudes, but they failed to elicit the observed latitude.","848":"This result was a problem for him, as he was about to brood over the lunar motions.","849":"Now since I suspected what proved to be true\u2014that the hypothesis was inadequate\u2014I girded myself for the work following opinions that had been preconceived and had been expressed in my Mysterium cosmographicum.","850":"At the beginning there was great controversy between us as to whether it were possible to set up another sort of hypothesis which would express to a hair\u2019s breadth so many positions of the planet, and whether it were possible for the  former hypothesis to be false despite its having accomplished this so far over the entire circuit of the zodiac.","851":"I consequently showed, using the arguments presented already in Part I, that an eccentric can be false, yet answer for the appearances within five minutes or better, provided that the equant point be true.","852":"As for the parallax of the annual orb, and the latitudes, that prize was still unclaimed, and had not yet been won by the hypothesis of those others.","853":"What remains, then, is to find  out whether they, with their computation, might not somewhere differ from the observations by five minutes.","854":"I therefore began to investigate the certitude of their operation.","855":"What success came of that labor, it would be boring and pointless to recount.","856":"I shall describe only so much of that labor of four years as will pertain to our methodical enquiry.","857":"Chapter 8","858":"Tycho Brahe\u2019s table of observed and computed observations of Mars\u2019s oppositions to the line of the sun\u2019s mean motion, and an examination thereof.","859":"Now the table, mentioned above, was the following:","860":"An accurate rendering of the motion of the planet Mars on its eccentric from trustworthy acronychal observations in a variety of positions, carried out sedulously of twenty years (1580 to 1600).","861":"1","862":"The amended mean longitudinal motion of Mars at the beginning of 1585 was found to exceed the numbers provided by the Prutenic calculation2 by at least a minute and a half, or at most 1\u00be\u2019, which by all indications appears more nearly correct ^3.","863":"However, the position of its apogee then fell short of the Prutenic calculation at the same time, by 5\u00b0 2\u2019, both being compared with the first star of Aries in the Copernican manner.","864":"Hence, owing to our removal of the vernal equinox westward from that star, which was then 28\u00b0 2\u00bd\u2019,4 it is concluded that Mars\u2019s apogee was at 23\u00b0 25\u2019 Leo.","865":"For the first date it was set at 23\u00b0 20\u2019 Leo, and for the last, at 23\u00b0 45\u2019 Leo.","866":"Also, the maximum eccentricity, composed of the semidiameters of the two small circles, was found to be 20, 160 parts, of which the semidiameter of the greater epicycle, or distance between centers as given by Copernicus, is 16,380.","867":"In both of these, however, he differs both from himself and from Ptolemy.","868":"Care was taken, where appropriate, concerning refraction, using the solar parallax.","869":"THIS, THEN, IS BRAHE\u2019S TABLE","870":"We shall begin the examination of the sun\u2019s mean motion with the listed instants of equal time, as many as the table presents.","871":"For indeed, it is the sun\u2019s mean position in opposition to which the table says the star Mars was found, referred to the ecliptic.","872":"You see here that the sun\u2019s mean position differs from opposition to Mars\u2019s apparent position on the ecliptic by 13\u00bd\u2019 in some cases, nearly thrice the error which could arise through a change of hypothesis.","873":"Therefore, the exactness of their hypothesis did not prevent my seeking another.","874":"But they permitted this discrepancy advisedly.","875":"This is clear from the following: since the nodes are about 17\u00b0 Taurus and Scorpio, and the limits about 17\u00b0 Leo and Aquarius, as will be said below, the additions and subtractions are made chiefly at 17\u00b0 Cancer, 25\u00b0 Virgo, 4\u00b0 Scorpio, 27\u00b0 Sagittarius, and 13\u00b0 Pisces, intermediate points, and none at 21\u00b0 Leo and 18\u00b0 Scorpio, the nodes and the limit.","876":"They therefore had reason to believe that a planet is not divested of its second inequality unless the sun\u2019s departure from the node is as great as the planet\u2019s on its own orbit.","877":"Their intentions, moreover, were not consistent.","878":"For, in their way of thinking, the difference ought to be greatest at 3\u00b0 Cancer, because Cancer is closest to the 45th degree,5 where this difference is generally greatest.","879":"But at 17\u00b0 Cancer they subtracted 5 minutes, while at 3\u00b0 Cancer, one minute only.","880":"Because of this, the following table, comparing the positions (referred to the orbit of Mars) with the mean positions of the sun at these moments, is presented.","881":"Clearly, they did not compensate the whole difference in this way.","882":"We shall discuss this plan of theirs once more a little later.","883":"Now, we shall also examine Mars\u2019s mean motion, for the sake of which, see the following table.","884":"6 7","885":"I am therefore missing something small in the mean longitude.","886":"For, that nearly everywhere there is half a minute too much, may be so because of my having computed the mean motions from the most recent table, in which something might possibly have been deliberately altered.","887":"There follows a table of Mars\u2019s eccentric positions.","888":"All positions are tolerably accurate except 27\u00b0 Sagittarius.","889":"Here, for various reasons, a small but appreciable quantity has been accumulated.","890":"First, the sun\u2019s position is 26\u00b0 45\u2019 24\u201d Gemini.","891":"Now the computed position on Mars\u2019s orbit is 26\u00b0 24\u2019 43\u201d Sagittarius.","892":"In the opinion of the table, 10\u2019 20\u201d are to be subtracted from the latter to refer it to the ecliptic.","893":"Therefore, the computed position on the ecliptic would be 26\u00b0 24\u2019 13\u201d Sagittarius, a difference from opposition to the sun of 21\u2019 11\u201d.","894":"Chapter 9","895":"On referring the ecliptic position to the circle of Mars.","896":"But it is now time for us to discuss in detail this adjusting to the ecliptic or to the planet's orbit, which serves as a foundation.","897":"First, the table provides us the following information from the observations: the northern latitude takes its rise from 18\u00b0 Taurus, at which it was five minutes, reaches its observed maximum at 21\u00b0 Leo, decreased thereafter and became only 1\u2154\u00b0 at 3\u00b0 Scorpio, but right away at 27\u00b0 Sagittarius it was south  and a rather large 4\u00b0, and still","898":"greater at 13\u00b0 Pisces.","899":"From this one concludes roughly that the ascending node is a little before 18\u00b0 Taurus, and the descending node far beyond 3\u00b0 Scorpio.","900":"The nodes will therefore be around 17\u00b0 Taurus and 17\u00b0 Scorpio, and the limits around 17\u00b0 Leo and Aquarius.","901":"Since the plane of Mars\u2019s eccentric is inclined to the plane of the ecliptic, nearly the same thing that happens with the right ascensions of parts of the ecliptic will happen here: the observed arcs of one circle do not correspond to the same observed arcs on the other, except the ones beginning at a node and ending at a limit.","902":"I use the term, \u201cobserved arcs\u201d, because here one must mentally separate out the planet\u2019s eccentricity, and proceed as though Mars\u2019s path were in the orb of the fixed stars, exactly as is the ecliptic, and as though it really intersected the latter.","903":"And indeed, when asked what is the ecliptic position of a planet, astronomers  define it thus: it is that point on the ecliptic at which the circle of latitude (at right angles to the ecliptic) passing through the sidereal position of the planet\u2019s body intersects the ecliptic.","904":"It is therefore clear from the demonstrations in Theodosius\u2019s On the Sphere that unless this circle passes through the poles of both circles (the ecliptic and the planet\u2019s path), its points of intersection will always cut off unequal arcs as measured from the point at which the two circles intersect.","905":"And since the circle of latitude is at right angles to the ecliptic, it will always be oblique to the planetary orbit if it does not pass through the poles of the orbit.","906":"Consequently, the arc between the planet\u2019s position on its orbit and the nearest node is always greater than that between its ecliptic position and the same node.","907":"Now when we observe the planets, we do not feel convinced that we have  defined their exact positions until we have referred them to the ecliptic.","908":"We do this by indicating the point on the ecliptic at which the circle of latitude passing through the planet is found.","909":"The ecliptic position is used, therefore, to aid our memory and comprehension.","910":"But when, on the other hand, we compute the planet in its own hypothesis,1 we are not concerned with the ecliptic to which it is inclined, but with the exact path of the planet.","911":"Therefore, to be able to","912":"compare the observed position with the computed position, we must either extend the arc between the ecliptic position and the nearer node, or abridge the arc between the body of the planet and the same node, so that from the former operation the position on the orbit might be given, and from the latter, the ecliptic position.","913":"This is actually accomplished by adding or subtracting, according as the node precedes or follows the planet\u2019s position.","914":"Such care concerning the planets Ptolemy considered unnecessary.","915":"Copernicus did not forego it in treating the moon, and Tycho Brahe diligently embraced it for the sake of precision.","916":"To continue: in the referring process which we have been considering, there are two things I would like to know, both of which I can seek using the same procedure  and diagram.","917":"Let A be the sidereal position of the node, AB the arc of the ecliptic, and upon it let AC be set equal to AB, and let the planet be observed beneath C. Further, from C let an arc be drawn perpendicular to the ecliptic, and let it be CE.","918":"Now in the first place the ancients thought that since E is the position on the ecliptic and C the position of the orbit of the planet I, the planet is at the point opposite the sun when the sun is at E, the planet being observed at C. However, as was said above, those who constructed the tables thought that the planet is not exactly at opposition to the sun unless arc AB,","919":"the elongation of the place opposite the sun from the same node, is made equal to AC (the observed distance of the planet from the node).","920":"Now the truth of the matter is quite different.","921":"The planet is, indeed, seen in opposition to the sun at that time, but it really is not, and the advantage we seek from the planet\u2019s opposition to the sun is more harmed by making AC and AB equal, than they themselves were hoping it would be corrected.","922":"For why are the planets observed at opposition to the sun?","923":"In order, of course, that they then lack the second inequality of longitude.","924":"And when the point opposite the sun is at B and the planet is at C, both being between the nodes and the limits, the planet is more wrapped up in the second inequality of longitude than if the point opposite the sun were at E, the planet remaining at C. For let G be the sun, the center of the planetary system, at which all the orbs intersect the ecliptic, whether in the Copernican or the Brahean form.","925":"Let G be joined to A and E, points on the ecliptic, and let the earth be on the line EG, at H. Let HC be joined, and from H let the sun G be observed opposite E, while from the same point H let the planet be seen at C, its sidereal position along the line HC.","926":"Therefore, in this sighting, the planet is really on the line HC.","927":"It is, however, far below the fixed stars.","928":"Let it be at the point I on the line HC, and let a straight line be drawn from G through I, which will intersect the arc CE.","929":"For the whole plane CEHG is beneath the arc EC.","930":"Let its point of intersection be F, and let a third arc AF be drawn from A through F to BC, cutting BC at D. It is obvious that the plane of the planet\u2019s eccentric viewed from H towards C is set beneath AF, not AC, and that when the point opposite the sun is at E, the planet will really be beneath F, while when the point opposite the sun is located at B the planet is really going to be beneath D, although both do appear beneath C. But AD is shorter than the legs of the isosceles triangle BAC.","931":"Therefore, the point B opposite the sun is farther from A than is D, the position beneath which the planet is at the moment they have chosen.","932":"Therefore, the sun really stands beyond the point opposite the planet's true position.","933":"This is contrary to what they proposed to do.","934":"But it is likewise false that if the orbit of the planet were beneath AC, AB should on that account be taken equal to AC.","935":"For the orbit\u2019s really being beneath AD is likewise not sufficient reason for taking AD equal to AB.","936":"For since the planet is observed at the point opposite the sun in order that it might shed the second inequality of longitude, while the longitude is to be reckoned on the planet\u2019s true orbit, or on AD which stands above it, surely, unless the point opposite the sun falls upon the arc drawn through the planet at right angles to the orbit (that is, unless ADB is a right angle), the point B opposite the sun will not coincide in longitude with D. But if ADB is a right angle, AB is longer than AD.","937":"They are therefore not equal.","938":"Clearly, therefore, the equality between arcs AC and AB that the table aspires to is undermined.","939":"However, for practical purposes, these differences are smaller than can be perceived.","940":"I therefore do not hesitate to allow the place opposite the sun to be at E, with AEF right and AFE consequently acute, even though it has just been demonstrated that AFE should be right instead.","941":"But it was also necessary to proceed against a new claim of accuracy, by means of accurate arguments.","942":"What follows here is the harm arising from this accuracy.","943":"In the second place, then, I wish to establish this: that in the table of adjustment they followed a procedure that is unsound.","944":"For, given Mars\u2019s ecliptic position E and apparent latitude EC, they computed the length of AC, and stated that the planet on its orbit was then distant from the node by their quantity AC.","945":"Now the orbit of the planet (whose first inequality we are investigating) is not beneath AC, but beneath AD, as was just shown.","946":"Therefore, the arc AC has nothing to do with the first inequality, but adulterates the planet\u2019s true elongations from A. And furthermore, the apparent latitude is EHC, while the true latitude of the point F, the inclination of the line GF to the ecliptic, is EGF.","947":"Thus, although the second inequality of longitude is swallowed up at opposition to the sun, the second inequality of latitude is nonetheless near its maximum there, and its measure is the angle HIG.","948":"Therefore, just as the whole latitude EC causes AC to be longer than AE by the arc EB, similarly, the part FC or HIG of this apparent latitude, which is a result of the second inequality, makes AC longer than AF.","949":"So it is longer than it should be.","950":"And this error cannot be ignored, as it can be as much as 9 minutes.","951":"This error could also have been perceived in the inconstancy of the angle BAC, which they attributed to the inclination of the planes of the ecliptic and of Mars's orbit.","952":"This is clear from the result obtained if you suppose the arc AC to be increased by the amount of the addition expressed in the table, and use this and AC to compute the angle EAC.","953":"For the angles come out as in the accompanying table,  from which it is clear that in the northern semicircle they suppose an angle of maximum northern latitude of 4\u00b0 33\u2019, and in the southern, of 6\u00b0 26\u2019 south.","954":"According to this, at the subtending line connecting the nodes, which passes through the sun or earth, the plane of the eccentric would somehow be bent, since the upper part is less inclined than the lower.","955":"Or rather, the whole path or plane of the planet\u2019s eccentric would be full of twists and turns, just as is the path described beneath the fixed stars by the observed latitudes of Mars, which is no circle.","956":"However, all this is in conflict with the simplicity of the celestial motions, as many examples from experience will attest.","957":"Therefore, the true procedure for referring the inclinations to the orbit is this: from the planet\u2019s position E on the ecliptic, known from the observations, to find the angle of inclination EGF for that position, using the method that will follow below.","958":"Then, since the angle E is right, from AE and EF (the measure of the angle EGF) AF is found by trigonometry, or instead of EF the constant angle  EAF may be used.","959":"And since, from arguments which I shall present below, it is clear that for the star Mars the angle EAF is not greater than about 1\u00b0 50\u2019, the adjustment about 45\u00b0 from the node (where it is maximum) accordingly does not exceed one minute, for which the table nonetheless has one add 8 or 10 minutes in certain places.","960":"So for this reason, too, the hypothesis can be in error by as much as 7 and 9 minutes, since the observations upon which it was founded suffered no little loss through this adjustment.","961":"I was consequently subject to much less restraint than before in seeking out a new hypothesis.","962":"Chapter 10","963":"Consideration of the observations themselves, with which Tycho Brahe hunted for the moments of opposition to the mean sun.","964":"In an enquiry of such precision, I could not have foregone a deeper inspection of the foundations themselves.","965":"And Brahe had given me the opportunity to make use of his observations.","966":"This is what I found.","967":"On 1580 November 12 at 10h 50m,1 they set Mars down at 8\u00b0 36\u2019 50\u201d Gemini2 without mentioning the horizontal variations,  by which term I wish the diurnal parallaxes and the refractions to be understood in what follows.","968":"Now this observation is distant and isolated.","969":"It was reduced to the moment of opposition using the diurnal motion from the Prutenic Tables ^3.","970":"For in Maestlin,4 on the twelfth at noon, Mars is put at 8\u00b0 20\u2019 Gemini, and on the seventeenth, again at noon, it is at 6\u00b0 25\u2019 Gemini.","971":"Therefore, the motion over five whole days would be 1\u00b0 55\u2019.","972":"In Stadius,5 it is 1\u00b0 52\u2019.","973":"Therefore, on the seventeenth at the same hour of 10h 50m, Mars ought to have been seen at either 6\u00b0 41\u2019 50\u201d Gemini, or 6\u00b0 44\u2019 50\u201d.","974":"At 9h 40m (which Tycho gives as the moment of opposition), it is 1\u2019 4\u201d farther forward, at either 6\u00b0 42\u2019 54\u201d or 6\u00b0 45\u2019 54\u201d.","975":"They put it at 6\u00b0 46\u2019 10\u201d Gemini.","976":"You see that this opposition (as regards exactness) is a little more uncertain because it makes use of a diurnal motion which is not observed but imported from elsewhere, and about which the different authors differ from one another by three minutes over these five days.","977":"On 1582 December 28 at 11h 30m, they set Mars down at 16\u00b0 47\u2019 Cancer by observation ^6.","978":"The moment of opposition assigned by Tycho comes 46 minutes later, during which the planet retrogressed less than one minute.","979":"Tycho therefore puts it at 16\u00b0 46\u2019 16\u201d Cancer ^7.","980":"On an inserted sheet here, an attempt was made to correct for a refraction of two minutes.","981":"This was, I think, first trial of the theory of refraction then being developed.","982":"Nevertheless, he followed the observed value unchanged, thus declining to consider the planet as something which could alter its position.","983":"Nor was there any need for  correction, since it was in Cancer, beyond the reach of refraction, and was in mid-sky where, in Cancer, there is no longitudinal parallax.","984":"On 1585 January 31 at 12h 0m, Mars was placed at 21\u00b0 18\u2019 11\u201d Leo ^8.","985":"The diurnal motion, by comparison of observations, was 24\u2019 15\u201d.","986":"The moment of opposition followed at 19h 35m, 7 hours and 35 minutes later.","987":"To this period belongs 7\u2019 41\u201d of diurnal motion westward.","988":"Therefore, at the designated moment, it would have been at 21\u00b0 10\u2019 30\u201d Leo, which is what was accepted.","989":"There is no mention of parallax.","990":"Nothing had to be done about refraction, because Mars was high and at mid-sky.","991":"I therefore find the bit of advice in the table about refraction (properly) ignored.","992":"On 1587 March 7 at 19h 10m they deduced the position of Mars from the observations, which was 25\u00b0 10\u2019 20\u201d Virgo.","993":"This they kept in the table, but changed the time to 17h 22m.","994":"The difference of 1h 48m multiplied by a diurnal motion of 24\u2019 gives the same number of minutes and seconds (that is, 1\u2019 48\u201d), no more.","995":"It therefore should have been 25\u00b0 8\u2019 32\u201d Virgo, which also approaches nearer the point opposite the sun.","996":"The difference is of practically no importance ^9.","997":"On 1589 April 15 at 12h 5m they established the position of Mars very carefully at 3\u00b0 58' 21\" Scorpio, and corrected for longitudinal parallax so as to make it 3\u00b0 57\u2019 11\u201d ^10.","998":"There remain 1h 30m until the designated moment of opposition, which, for a diurnal motion of 22', bring the planet back 1\u2019 22\u201d, so as to be at 3\u00b0 55\u2019 49\u201d.","999":"They took the value of 3\u00b0 58\u2019 10\u201d.","1000":"The former is closer to the sun\u2019s mean position.","1001":"On 1591 June 6 at 12h 20m, Mars is placed at 27\u00b0 15\u2019 Sagittarius ^11.","1002":"There remained 2 days 4 hours and 5 minutes until the designated moment.","1003":"In four days it was found to be moved forward 1\u00b0 12\u2019 47\u201d.","1004":"Therefore, to 2d 4h 5m correspond 39\u2019 29\u201d.","1005":"Consequently, at that moment Mars was at 26\u00b0 35\u2019 31\u201d Sagittarius.","1006":"There is no need to consider any horizontal variations in longitude, since Mars is at mid-sky and at the beginning of Capricorn.","1007":"The table has 26\u00b0 32\u2019 Sagittarius.","1008":"On 1593 24 August at 10h 30m they report Mars as being at 12\u00b0 38\u2019 Pisces12 with an observed diurnal motion of 16\u2019 45\u201d, and this near the nonagesimal13 where there is no longitudinal parallax.","1009":"The moment designated for the opposition preceded this by 8h 17m (for it was at 2h 13m),14 to which corresponds a motion of 5\u2019 48\u201d eastward.","1010":"Therefore, the planet falls at 12\u00b0 43\u2019 48\u201d Pisces.","1011":"And the table has 12\u00b0 43\u2019 45\u201d.","1012":"On 1595 October 30 at 8h 20m, they found Mars at 17\u00b0 48\u2019 Taurus, with a diurnal motion of 22\u2019 54\u201d ^15.","1013":"The designated moment preceded by 11h 48m, for which is required a motion of Mars of 11\u2019 7\u201d eastward, so that it would be at 17\u00b0 59\u2019 7\u201d Taurus.","1014":"But it was projected eastward on account of parallax.","1015":"Therefore, possibly using another observation on the meridian, they put down 17\u00b0 56\u2019 15\u201d Taurus in the table.","1016":"On 1597 December 10 at 8h 30m, they first placed Mars at 3\u00b0 30\u2019 Cancer, and again at 4\u00b0 1\u2019 Cancer, the mean being 3\u00b0 45\u00bd\u2019 Cancer ^16.","1017":"The moment of opposition came 3 days 5h 5m later, to which, from Magini, corresponds 1\u00b0 15\u2019 westward.","1018":"Therefore, Mars would have been at 2\u00b0 30\u00bd\u2019 Cancer.","1019":"In the table, it was put at 2\u00b0 28\u2019.","1020":"The reason for the rough measurement, carried out with a measuring staff, is clear from the date.","1021":"Tycho had left the island, leaving all  instruments but the staff behind.","1022":"Nevertheless, he did not wish to ignore this opposition completely.","1023":"But I wish he had still remained on the island, for this opposition was a marvelous opportunity, not often recurring within a man\u2019s lifetime, for examining Mars\u2019s parallax.","1024":"On 1600 January 13\/2317 at 11h 50m, the right ascension of Mars was: 18 19","1025":"Hence, Mars is at 10\u00b0 38\u2019 46\u201d Leo, at an adjusted time of 11h 40m reduced to the meridian of Uraniborg.","1026":"But on January 24\/February 3 at the same time it was at 6\u00b0 18\u2019 Leo.","1027":"This gives a diurnal motion of 23\u2019 44\u201d, and a position on January 19\/29 at 9h 40m of 8\u00b0 18\u2019 45\u201d Leo, just as they put it.","1028":"I have presented these discrepant values for the right ascension in order to show that even in the observations themselves there is an uncertainty of several minutes unless extreme care be exercised and all possible aids used.","1029":"At that time the instruments (except the largest) had arrived in Bohemia, but they were still not well enough positioned, and were affected by the journey besides.","1030":"However, even in observations at the island it too often happened that right ascensions measured from two different stars differed by three minutes.","1031":"When I asked Christian [Longomontanus], on this subject, whether I should consider this an effect of the limitations of observation or vision, he replied, \u201cThis is not unusual.\u201d","1032":"Finally, the reader should be advised that Tycho, in his table, claimed to have made use of the solar parallax in correcting the positions of Mars.","1033":"But it will now shortly be made clear that the parallax of Mars is a slippery and imperceptible business.","1034":"However, this does not much affect the certainty of the positions in this table, as Mars can almost always be observed in mid-sky where it has no longitudinal parallax.","1035":"Chapter 11","1036":"On the diurnal parallaxes of the star Mars.","1037":"The starting point of my new elaboration and renewal of the motions was where I have just stopped.","1038":"For it is clear from Part I that the positions of Mars should be taken at the moments of true opposition to the sun.","1039":"However, it is also clear that not every trace of the second inequality is thus removed, it being also necessary to refer the arc measured on the ecliptic to the planet\u2019s orbit.","1040":"But the planet\u2019s orbit must first be investigated by the inclination of the planes and by finding out the nodes.","1041":"Again, the inclination and the nodes  cannot be found without knowing the diurnal parallax, at least if this should turn out to be relatively large.","1042":"One must therefore start with the parallax.","1043":"I shall present two ways to find it.","1044":"The first way (and the one more familiar to others) will be examined using the Brahean observations.","1045":"In 1582, when Mars was opposite the sun in Cancer, I found the observation done with incredible care, with Tycho\u2019s manuscript title, \u201cFor investigating the parallaxes of Mars\u201d, from which you will, however, deduce either no parallax at all, or one exceedingly small.","1046":"I pass over without saying, that (as is customary) they compared the star Mars with nearby stars on the ecliptic, and frequently with ones at a great distance.","1047":"Now it is usual to find the parallax of a mobile star (for Mars moves, with a retrograde motion when opposite the sun) by comparing morning and evening observations.","1048":"As a result, it has happened that almost all the stars by which Mars was observed in the morning are different from those by which it was observed in the evening.","1049":"For a fixed star which is at hand in the morning (and higher than Mars), if it be near the ecliptic, has either set by evening (when Mars is in the west) or is rendered useless by refraction for this delicate procedure.","1050":"Another star therefore had to be substituted.","1051":"But if the fixed stars are substituted for one another, there is always less trust in the procedure than if the same star should be retained.","1052":"Brahe, however, announced to the learned world in many places that from the observations of that year, the parallax of Mars was found to be considerably greater than that of the sun.","1053":"I therefore very carefully scrutinized the whole book in order to examine his operation or computation more deeply.","1054":"I did indeed find a chapter which professed to offer a procedure for investigating the parallax of Mars from the observations of that year.","1055":"But here was something really surprising: they fitted the position of Mars found by observation into a Copernican diagram drawn very laboriously and carefully.","1056":"In this diagram, they took up the immense labor of solving all triangles created by the double epicycle on the concentric, in numbers replete with a great many digits.","1057":"Finally, this was the goal of the calculation: to issue a pronouncement that the parallax of Mars is indeed greater than the solar parallax.","1058":"Brahe had thus asked one thing, but his assistants in calculation carried out something else.","1059":"He wanted them to find out the parallax of Mars by comparing morning and evening observations with one another, but they had in fact found out how much parallax the Copernican diagram would bring about.","1060":"Whether Brahe\u2019s pronouncement on parallax was founded solely upon his trust in his assistants, is unknown to me ^1.","1061":"As for us, let us consult the actual observations, insofar as they pertain to our undertaking.","1062":"In 1582 on the night between 23 and 24 November, the distances from the fixed stars remained the same at different times.","1063":"This, then, was a station point ^2.","1064":"On the following two days, the motion was 11\u2019 and 15\u2019.","1065":"On the night of 26 December,3 it passed between the second and seventh stars of Gemini,4 its distance (measured with the staff) from the head of the lower of the Twins (the second star) being 2\u00b0 25\u2019 or 2\u00b0 26\u2019, but from the seventh,","1066":"1\u00b0 6\u2019 or 1\u00b0 7\u2019, making the latitude about 4\u00b0 9\u2019.","1067":"Then, at 8h 28m, it was 44\u00b0 41\u2019 from","1068":"the eye of Taurus,5 whose latitude is 5\u00b0 31\u2019 south, longitude 4\u00b0 12\u00bd\u2019 Gemini, in 1600.","1069":"Hence, Mars\u2019s longitude as if the year were 1600 is 17\u00b0 53\u2153\u2019 Cancer,6 or, at the end of 1582, 17\u00b0 38\u2019 Cancer, at an altitude of 40\u00b0 50\u2019.","1070":"It is thus beyond the effects of refraction.","1071":"Again, at 7h 15m on the morning of December 27, it was 36\u00b0 43\u2019 from Cor Leonis,7 whose latitude is 0\u00b0 26\u00bd\u2019; hence, its longitude at the end of 1582 is 17\u00b0 28\u2153\u2019 Cancer, altitude 14\u00b0 4\u2019, and thus affected by refraction.","1072":"Therefore, from 8h 28\u00bdm in the evening to 19h 15m, an interval of 10h 46\u00bdm, it was observed to retrogress 9\u2154\u2019.","1073":"For the diurnal motion, on the 29th at 7h 47m, the distance of Mars from the southern foot of Erichthonius8 was 29\u00b0 38\u00bd\u2019 But on the 30th at 8h 8m the distance from the same star was 29\u00b0 13\u00bd ^9.","1074":"Therefore, over 24h 21m it moved 25\u2019.","1075":"And this diurnal motion remained the same on the 27th.","1076":"Therefore, to 10h 46\u00bdm there should have corresponded 11\u00bd\u2019 of arc, but we found only 9\u2154\u2019.","1077":"Let us consider this.","1078":"On the previous evening, when Mars was rising farther to the east (because it was retrograde), parallax moved it eastward, and in the morning, when it was setting and was farther to the west, parallax moved it westward.","1079":"So, just as the moon\u2019s diurnal parallax apparently slows its motion, the same parallax in turn quickens Mars\u2019s retrograde motion.","1080":"Therefore, if parallax is perceived, it is perceived through an excessively enlarged diurnal motion.","1081":"But this motion is diminished.","1082":"Therefore, there is no parallax.","1083":"Again, refraction is perceived as contrary to parallax.","1084":"Now the refraction at altitude 13\u00b0 is 4\u2019 from the table of fixed stars, and 8\u2019 from the table of the sun,10 and only a very small part of this affects the longitude, as Cancer descends quite obliquely.","1085":"So the refraction in longitude comes to three minutes at most, which, added to 9\u2154\u2019, makes the refraction-free motion 12\u2154\u2019 over 10\u00be hours, which motion, if it also were free from parallax, ought to have been 11\u00bd\u2019.","1086":"Therefore, the excess of 1\u2153\u2019 is the longitudinal parallax for the two observations\u2014clearly minimal, untrustworthy, and entirely contemptible.","1087":"On 1583 January 16 at 7h 30m in the evening,11 Mars was 23\u00b0 29\u2019 from the bright star in the foot of Erichthonius at an altitude of 51\u00b0.","1088":"The next morning at 5h 0m, it was 43\u00b0 58\u2019 from Cor Leonis at an altitude of 15\u00b0.","1089":"And, measured by the straight edge, Mars was perfectly collinear with the two stars.","1090":"And so, since Mars\u2019s motion is carried out along this line, Brahe made a note that the longitudinal parallax is given from the diurnal motion of Mars.","1091":"This is obtained here as follows.","1092":"On January 16 at 10\u00bdh it was 23\u00b0 27\u2019 from the bright star in the foot of Erichthonius.","1093":"On January 17 at 10\u2157h 12 it was 23\u00b0 12\u00bd\u2019 from the same star.","1094":"Therefore, the diurnal motion would be 14\u00bd\u2019.","1095":"Now in order to comply with Brahe\u2019s advice, we must set out the distance between the foot of Erichthonius and Cor Leonis, which is found to be 67\u00b0 21\u2019.","1096":"Subtracting Mars's distance from the bright star in the foot of Erichthonius, 23\u00b0 29\u2019, leaves Mars's distance from Cor Leonis, 43\u00b0 52\u2019, at 7\u00bdh in the evening, which at 5h in the morning was 43\u00b0 58\u2019, 6 minutes greater.","1097":"The time interval is 9\u00bd hours, to which ought to correspond 5\u215d\u2019 of the diurnal motion.","1098":"Here, therefore, the  sum of the two parallaxes is no more than \u215c\u2019 except that the amount of Mars\u2019s longitudinal refraction at 15\u00b0 is added to it.","1099":"But this is quite small.","1100":"For Cancer and Leo are setting extremely obliquely, and Mars's large northern latitude put it at nearly the same altitude as Cor Leonis.","1101":"On January 17 at 5h 20m in the evening,13 Mars was 23\u00b0 16\u2019 from the foot of Erichthonius.","1102":"On the following day, the 18th, at 3h 0m in the morning, this distance was 23\u00b0 9\u2019, and at 5h 5m in the evening it was 23\u00b0 1\u00bd\u2019.","1103":"So the motion over 23h 45m is 14\u00bd\u2019, but over 9h 40m it is 7\u2019.","1104":"This should have been 6\u2019.","1105":"We are left with a longitudinal parallax of no more than 1\u2019.","1106":"Refraction does not affect anything, since in both instances the altitude of Mars was about 30\u00b0.","1107":"Likewise, at 7h 34m its distance from the seventh star of Gemini14 was 7\u00b0 51\u2019.","1108":"At 4h 52m in the morning, it was 7\u00b0 59\u2019 from the same star.","1109":"Therefore, over 9h 18m it moved 8\u2019.","1110":"We thus have one minute more than before.","1111":"Of this star (at the shoulder of Gemini), Brahe wrote, \u201cNote that I am taking Mars\u2019s distance from this star because its course passes through it, as it were, so that the morning and evening distances compared might show the parallax.\u201d I have reproduced this here so that the reader may rest assured that Brahe did not proceed without a purpose.","1112":"On January 18 at 8h 52m in the evening15 there was 44\u00b0 22\u2019 between Mars and Cor Leonis.","1113":"At 4\u00beh in the morning the same distance was 44\u00b0 27\u2153\u2019.","1114":"Therefore, the motion over 7h 53m was 5\u2153\u2019.","1115":"On January 19 following, at 7h 3m, this distance was 44\u00b0 32\u00bd\u2019.","1116":"Therefore, for 22h 11m the motion is 10\u00bd\u2019.","1117":"And for 8 hours there would be less than 4\u2019 of motion.","1118":"Our profit is about 1\u00bd\u2019 of parallax.","1119":"But now let us calculate, for January 17, how much of an increase in the hourly motion should result from a parallax greater than the solar parallax as usually accepted.","1120":"Since we consider the sun\u2019s parallax to be three minutes, let Mars have four.","1121":"16","1122":"It follows that the motion of mars over those hours should have appeared 4\u2019 greater than what follows proportionally from the diurnal motion.","1123":"Since this is repudiated by the observations, Mars\u2019s parallax is found \u2013 often none at all.","1124":"There was even an occasional note in Brahe\u2019s hand saying, \u201cIt strayed over to the wrong side.\u201d So this is the first way of investigating Mars\u2019s parallax.","1125":"I shall now add the other way, because of its beauty; I cannot use the Brahean observations in it.","1126":"Therefore, in using my own observations, I am going to give you a clown show, and will show by example why Brahe needed such diligence, precision of instruments, assistants, and other equipment.","1127":"I have two instruments, which I use through the generosity of Baron Friedrich Hoffmann, L.B ^17.","1128":"an iron sextant and a brass azimuthal quadrant.","1129":"The latter is two and a half feet in diameter and the former three and a half, and both are calibrated in one-minute divisions.","1130":"Now at this very time, 1604, at which I am considering parallax (whether that of the sun more than Mars\u2019s is hard to say, for my Hipparchus18 requires Mars\u2019s aid even in the lunar eclipses), a very suitable occasion for observation arose, if only the climate zone had been different and Mars had moved a little higher.","1131":"For about 19\/29 February19 of this year 1604, Mars was stationary both in longitude and in latitude at the same time.","1132":"This occurred in Libra, and therefore from Mars\u2019s rising to the sun\u2019s rising the angle of the horizon with the ecliptic continually decreased.","1133":"Consequently, according to Ch.","1134":"9 of the Astronomiae Optica20 the latitudinal parallax, if any, continually increases.","1135":"But from the increment (found through the columns of the parallactic table21 opposite the initial and final angles of the ecliptic with the horizon), the whole horizontal parallax (at the front of the column) is known.","1136":"There follows the series of my observations ^22.","1137":"On the night between Thursday and Friday, which was February 17\/27, while Corvus was on the meridian, there was 9\u00b0 44\u2019 between Mars and Spica, and between it and the Northern Pan,23 17\u00b0 41\u2019; and between Mars and Arcturus, 29\u00b0 13\u2019.","1138":"Also, to test the sextant, we measured the interval between Arcturus and Spica as 32\u00b0 57\u2019, which should have been 33\u00b0 1\u2019 45\u201d, as is clear if you calculate it using the right ascensions and declinations, or latitudes and longitudes, which Tycho assigned to these stars in Book I of the Progymnasmata ^24.","1139":"Therefore, my distances are smaller than the true distances by 4\u00be minutes.","1140":"I applied this correction to the distances of Mars from the fixed stars, so as to make it 9\u00b0 48\u2019 45\u201d from Spica, 17\u00b0 45\u2019 45\u201d from the Pan, and 29\u00b0 17\u2019 45\u201d from Arcturus ^25.","1141":"I then used the quadrant to obtain the meridian altitude of Mars, 32\u00b0 4\u2019, and of Spica, 30\u00b0 50\u2019.","1142":"Since the latter has a declination of 9\u00b0 2\u2019, Mars is left with a declination of 7\u00b0 48\u201d.","1143":"However, the altitude of Spica showed that my perpendicular was not well enough set up.","1144":"For the altitude of the equator, at my location, is 39\u00b0 54\u2019.","1145":"Accordingly, the meridian altitude of Spica is 30\u00b0 52\u2019, and of Mars, 32\u00b0 6\u2019.","1146":"Now, from the declination of Mars and its distance from the fixed star, its right ascension comes out: 26","1147":"I am not certain whether, when (as happened a few times) the clamps holding the arm loosened and it (being a heavy piece of iron) fell precipitously and hit hard, it might not have changed the position of the sights, since they are removable and subject to dislocation.","1148":"But from this right ascension, I first select,  from Tycho\u2019s table of right ascensions, the degree of the right sphere that was riding at the same time, 28\u00b0 1\u2019 0\u201d Libra,27 whose declination, from another of that author\u2019s tables,28 is 10\u00b0 48\u2019 30\u201d [South].","1149":"But that of Mars is 7\u00b0 48\u2019 [South].","1150":"Therefore, Mars is distant from the ecliptic, the oblique path, by 3\u00b0 0\u2019 30\u201d on the circle of declination.","1151":"But the angle which the circle of declination makes with the ecliptic is 68\u00b0 59\u2019 from the appropriate table.","1152":"Its complement is 21\u00b0 1\u2019.","1153":"And in my table of parallax,29 under the heading of 60\u2019, I find, opposite 68\u00b0 59\u2019, the entry 56\u2019 1\u201d.","1154":"Under 30\u201d, however, I find 28\u201d.","1155":"But since I have thrice 60\u2019 in this distance of Mars from the ecliptic (which I call the base of the latitude  ), I multiply what I extracted under 60\u2019 by 3 ^30.","1156":"This gives me a latitude of 2\u00b0 48\u2019 31\u201d.","1157":"The same operation opposite 21\u00b0 1\u2019 shows me what has to be subtracted from the place rising at the same time, namely, 1\u00b0 5\u2019 4\u201d.","1158":"Accordingly, Mars\u2019s position will be 26\u00b0 56\u2019 Libra.","1159":"I come within a minute of this using a computation whose fundamentals I am going to be presenting in this work.","1160":"To test the latitude of Mars, I also consulted the distance from Arcturus, through the star\u2019s latitude and longitude provided from Tycho, and Mars\u2019s longitudinal position just found, and it replied to me that Mars was at a latitude of 2\u00b0 47\u2019 48\u201d.","1161":"Before, it was at 2\u00b0 48\u2019 31\u201d.","1162":"On February 19\/29 we had moved the sight, and began to observe Mars rising.","1163":"Its distances from Arcturus were noted, and were these:","1164":"I think we are ten minutes too high.","1165":"For the wind was blowing so hard that it was only by a glowing coal that we could cast light upon the scale so as to read it.","1166":"And the altitude of Mars was then 11\u00b0.","1167":"Later, the back of Leo31 culminated at altitude 62\u00b0 37\u2019, according to a corrected plumb line.","1168":"Thus the altitude of the equator was shown to be 39\u00b0 55\u2019: almost correct.","1169":"At that moment, Mars\u2019s altitude was 23\u00b0.","1170":"We next reinvestigated the former distance [to Arcturus], which came out to be:  Therefore without doubt the previous distance was","1171":"For first, when Mars was near the horizon, refraction moved it toward  Arcturus, later letting it drops down when Mars had acquired some altitude.","1172":"It was, however, the cold and the extremely biting winds that occasioned so much variety in observations made at the same time.","1173":"For it was impossible to handle the iron and close the clamps with bare hands, and with gloves the arm was not securely enough clamped to be read to the minutes.","1174":"Vindemiatrix32 showed a meridian altitude of 53\u00b0 5\u2019, a little greater than it should have had.","1175":"But Spica\u2019s 30\u00b0 54\u2019 was correct within one minute.","1176":"The altitude of Mars at culmination was 32\u00b0 6\u2019, the same as it had been two days before, and of Arcturus, a correct 61\u00b0 13\u2019.","1177":"Hence, by computation, it is concluded that the distance of Mars and Arcturus was 29\u00b0 18\u2153\u2019.","1178":"Now since, according to the Prutenic Tables and to my computations, Mars was stationary in longitude at this time, there could be no change in meridian altitude resulting from its wandering about on the ecliptic.","1179":"For this reason, since the meridian altitude remained quite the same (for my instrument allows an uncertainty of one minute), neither did any change in the latitude occur during this time.","1180":"On February 22 or March 3 we tested the sextant, just as we had done above, and found 26\u00b0 2\u2019 between Canis Minor and Orion\u2019s higher shoulder,33 which the calculation shows to be 26\u00b0 2\u2019 15\u201d.","1181":"So also, between Canis minor and Palilicium34 was found 46\u00b0 22\u00bd\u2019, which Tycho, in his Epistolae, indicates is 46\u00b0 22\u2019 ^35.","1182":"Therefore, when the fifth star of Leo36 culminated, with the arm of the instrument fixed above 29\u00b0 13\u00bd\u2019 the distance was now more, while no error could be found at 29\u00b0 15\u2019.","1183":"Then the whole sky unexpectedly clouded over.","1184":"It became clear again on the morning of March 4, and now, when Antares culminated, with the arm fixed at 29\u00b0 19\u2019, both stars were seen evenly [with the sights].","1185":"However, it seemed that something needed to be added, but at 29\u00b0 20\u2019 too much had been added.","1186":"When the observation was finished, Saturn preceded the meridian by less than Jupiter preceded Saturn.","1187":"On the night following February 29 or March 10, the instrument having meanwhile been displaced, this distance was, first, between 29\u00b0 9\u2019 and 29\u00b0 10\u2019, half an hour before the culmination of the Heart of Hydra ^37.","1188":"Later, it appeared to the investigators to be between 29\u00b0 12\u2019 and 29\u00b0 13\u2019, as it was now higher and free from refraction.","1189":"For at the end of this observation it had an altitude of 19\u2159\u2019.","1190":"But a little afterward \u2013 I do not know whether the sights were disturbed \u2013 it would not allow that much, for it appeared to be 29\u00b0 9\u00bd\u2019.","1191":"The Tail of Leo38 was about half a degree from the meridian.","1192":"The altitude of Mars was then 24\u00be\u00b0.","1193":"The Tail of Leo, when culminating, had the correct altitude of 56\u00b0 44\u2019, within one minute.","1194":"When one third of the distance between Mars and Spica had crossed the meridian, it [i.e., the distance to Arcturus] first appeared to us to be 29\u00b0 9\u00bd\u2019, but the cylinder was not well enough applied, as it was too long.","1195":"Thus, a little later, this could not be accepted, but 29\u00b0 10\u00bc\u2019 or a little less seemed to be required.","1196":"And Mars was see on both sides of the cylinder.","1197":"Then, between Mars and Spica, there was 9\u00b0 26\u2019, and less than 9\u00b0 27\u2019.","1198":"Mars culminated at an altitude of 32\u00b0 19\u00bd\u2019.","1199":"39","1200":"There was then 18\u00b0 25\u2019 between Mars and the Norther Pan [of Libra].","1201":"For the investigation of the sextant, the distance between Spica and the Pan was taken as 27\u00b0 39\u2019, although it should have been 27\u00b0 34\u2019 ^40.","1202":"Also, the distance between Spica and the northern star in the head of Scorpius41 was 39\u00b0 32\u00bd\u2019, which should have been 39\u00b0 26\u00bd\u2019.","1203":"So the sextant read five minutes high.","1204":"Furthermore, calculation of Mars\u2019s position also provides evidence of this.","1205":"For unless you diminish Mars\u2019s distance from the fixed stars by 5 minutes, the right ascension measured through Spica and through the Pan will be discrepant by 10 minutes, but if (as required by the examination of the sextant) the five minutes be subtracted, they will coincide exactly, and will be 205\u00b0 27\u2019 10\u201d, with declination 7\u00b0 35\u00bd\u2019.","1206":"Therefore, the position is 26\u00b0 18\u2019 48\u201d Libra, with latitude 2\u00b0 47\u2019 20\u201d.","1207":"You see that the latitude is manifestly the same, though meanwhile the planet had retrogressed 38\u2019 in longitude.","1208":"If, from the position of Mars found thus, you find its distance from Arcturus, it will come out to be 29\u00b0 9\u2159\u2019, while using the faulty instrument it was 29\u00b0 14\u2019.","1209":"Now, with the Heart of Scorpius42 culminating, our distance [to Arcturus] was 29\u00b0 13\u00bd\u2019, the instrument in the meantime having been displaced and later repositioned.","1210":"We next tested the sextant again, which showed 44\u00b0 45\u2019 between Polaris and the Tail of Cygnus ^43.","1211":"This should have been 44\u00b0 39\u00bd\u2019.","1212":"Therefore, the instrument was in its pristine state.","1213":"But when Saturn had passed the meridian by one degree, the distance could not admit 29\u00b0 13\u00bd\u2019; nevertheless, it was greater than 29\u00b0 12\u00bd\u2019, about 29\u00b0 13\u2019.","1214":"So this is the series of observations.","1215":"I would be crazy if I tried to use them to build something of great precision.","1216":"Therefore, I am presenting an example to another more diligent and successful observer, rather than an argument.","1217":"I also hope that the nausea evoked by these uncertain observations will lead readers to desire all the more fervently the extremely certain Tychonic ones.","1218":"Now, on with the example.","1219":"The first and second days, agree only in showing the station in latitudinal motion.","1220":"In both, Mars was 29\u00b0 18\u2019 from Arcturus, and in both, its meridian altitude was 32\u00b0 7\u2019 or 6\u2019.","1221":"Those days were busying me in preparation for meeting the following days properly, should the instruments be needed.","1222":"But on March 3, with the Mouth of Leo44 culminating, the distance was 29\u00b0 15\u2019, and with the Heart of Scorpius45 culminating, 29\u00b0 19\u2019 plus.","1223":"Therefore the distance changed about 4\u00bc\u2019 over the interval.","1224":"And since Arcturus and Mars have very nearly the same longitude,46 this change of distance bespeaks a variation of latitudinal parallax.","1225":"I am not unaware that 29\u00b0 19\u2019 is hardly different from 29\u00b0 18\u2019, and that by analogy with the previous day the latter ought to be the distance at about the same time if Mars is standing still.","1226":"I also know that when the Mouth of Leo is on the meridian Mars is 12\u00bd\u00b0 high and is somewhat affected by refraction.","1227":"But of these we shall speak afterwards.","1228":"For now, let us entirely ignore them, so as not to complicate our example.","1229":"Now the altitude of the nonagesimal was 57\u2153\u00b0 (about) when the Mouth of Leo was culminating, but finally, after the Heart of Scorpius had culminated, it was 20\u2153\u00b0.","1230":"Let me therefore look through the parallactic table to find the column in which, from a distance from the zenith of 32\u2154\u00b0 to a distance of 69\u2154\u00b0, the entry in the table would change 4\u00bc\u2019.","1231":"I find that this happens in the column whose heading is 9\u2019 ^47.","1232":"Therefore, the maximum parallax of Mars would be 9\u2019.","1233":"And since, on that day, the distance of Mars and earth was to the distance of Mars and the sun as 28 is to 60 (given approximately by an anticipatory acquaintance with the hypotheses of Tycho and Copernicus), the ratio of the parallaxes will be the inverse of this, and the maximum  solar parallax will be about 4\u2019 24\u201d.","1234":"It is set at 3\u2019 0\u201d.","1235":"But now let us consider that at an altitude of 12\u00bd\u00b0 Mars would be subject to refraction, if the table of fixed star refractions constructed at Hven is valid for Prague.","1236":"At this altitude, it was 4\u2019 20\u201d, 2\u2019 18\u201d of which is owed to the latitude, by which Mars is caused to be closer to Arcturus.","1237":"If, however, we apply the sun\u2019s refraction to Mars (as it often appears we should), it is 8\u2019 45\u201d at this altitude, twice as great.","1238":"Therefore, the latitudinal parallax would also be twice as great, 4\u2019 36\u201d.","1239":"In this way, the whole difference which observation imposes upon itself, at these two different moments, would be due entirely to refraction.","1240":"Reckoning it in the former way would leave a latitudinal parallax of 2\u2019 \u2013 the difference in parallax in the column whose heading is 5\u2019.","1241":"This would give the sun only 2\u2019 25\u201d of maximum parallax.","1242":"So refraction makes our third day, too, suspect and doubtful, and ultimately quite worthless.","1243":"I know that since Arcturus and Mars are 9 degrees apart,48 which is one third of the amount by which Arcturus\u2019s latitude exceeds Mars\u2019s, it comes out that not all the latitudinal refraction is subtracted from the distances from Mars, and that the parallax changes Mars\u2019s latitude more than it changes this distance from Arcturus.","1244":"But since this is very small, I have, with greater fear, considered it as something to be left buried.","1245":"Let him observe it who is versed in more subtle matters.","1246":"Now on the fourth day, what seems to have been accomplished is nothing other than the total destruction of Mars\u2019s parallax.","1247":"The meridian distance ought to have been 29\u00b0 9\u00bd\u2019 with an accurate instrument, and consequently 29\u00b0 14\u2019 with the faulty one.","1248":"But at the end it was found to be 29\u00b0 13\u00bd\u2019, when the latitudinal parallax (had there been any) ought to have been greater, and hence the distance from Arcturus greater.","1249":"Hence, from that time when Mars attained an altitude of 19\u00b0, the distance was found to be 29\u00b0 12\u00bd\u2019, and one minute greater at the end.","1250":"This would be a very small parallax.","1251":"And what is this ratio?","1252":"When its altitude was 9 degrees (when Hydra was culminating), the distance was 29\u00b0 9\u2019 with a faulty instrument, and still subject to refraction.","1253":"Later, at an altitude of 25\u00b0 and near the meridian, it was again 29\u00b0 9\u2019, measured twice at different moments.","1254":"Could the refraction have been zero initially, that the arc thus remain constant?","1255":"Or should it rather be said that I (though to myself I might have seemed most diligent) erred in observing?","1256":"Especially on account of the length of the cylinder.","1257":"Still, it is at least established by these observations, whatever their quality, that Mars\u2019s parallaxes of latitude are not greater than 4\u2019, which is the amount of uncertainty in the instrument.","1258":"It is more credible that the parallax is very small.","1259":"In Ch.","1260":"64 below, you will find further discussion of this point.","1261":"That the parallaxes of Mars are greater than the sun\u2019s, on the other hand, is argued by the proportion in the Tychonic and Copernican hypothesis; and from this proportion Mars\u2019s parallax could easily be computed if we were certain of the sun\u2019s parallax.","1262":"Is, then, the procedure for finding the sun\u2019s altitude and parallax from eclipses uncertain?","1263":"It is indeed relatively uncertain quantitatively, but as concerns the thing itself it is perfectly certain.","1264":"The sun is not nearer than 230 semidiameters of the earth, but it is not an infinite number of semidiameters away.","1265":"But between 700 and 2000 semidiameters (of which the first quantity is from my Mysterium cosmographicum, while the other two are given as the upper and lower limits in observations of eclipses) it does not appear that any indisputable number has yet been demonstrated, as I shall prove in my Hipparchus.","1266":"Chapter 12","1267":"Investigation of Mars\u2019s Nodes.","1268":"Means are not wanting of investigating the planets\u2019 first inequality through observations, even when these are entangled in the second inequality.","1269":"Nevertheless, in this second part, I prefer to follow the footsteps of the authorities and make use of acronychal observations, in order to establish my credibility.","1270":"For I want to be sure that later, when I bring forth something contrary to accepted opinion, no one may complain that I am hiding behind the briar-path of my own method.","1271":"Furthermore, it is now clear that nothing of any importance is wanting in Mars\u2019s diurnal parallax as taken by Tycho.","1272":"I shall therefore move on, little by little, towards the reduction of the observed positions of Mars to the point opposite the sun\u2019s apparent position.","1273":"As a first step, we must find the nodes.","1274":"Tycho Brahe used to investigate them thus:","1275":"In the diagram of Ch.","1276":"9, let A be the position of the node, E the planet\u2019s position on the ecliptic in 1595, C the observed sidereal position of the planet, 17\u00b0 56\u2019 5\u201d Taurus, EC the observed latitude, 0\u00b0 5\u2019 15\u201d north.","1277":"Now it is presupposed that the angle EAC is very nearly 4\u00b0 34\u00bd\u2019, the same as the maximum northern latitude observed in the same way in 1585.","1278":"In the right triangle CEA (or the isosceles triangle CBA; the difference is unimportant in this procedure), from side CE and angle EAC he sought the length EA, the distance of the ecliptic position from the node.","1279":"There is nothing wrong with this operation, since EC is small and near","1280":"the node.","1281":"However, the need for accuracy1 in this demonstration commends another.","1282":"For it was said in Ch.","1283":"9 that the angle EAC is not constant; hence, through different latitudes of different oppositions they will also show different positions for the node.","1284":"Nor is EAC as great as the maximum apparent latitude, because AC is a curved arc; and neither is it AC, but some path inside (AF, say), that is the planet\u2019s path as it would be seen from the center of the sun.","1285":"Therefore, A will not necessarily be the node, at least as found through this operation.","1286":"I, therefore, investigated the nodes differently, using observations on the day on which they were at the node.","1287":"Even though this method depends upon some preconceptions, and the subject will be treated more accurately below in Part 5, we ought to have a first taste of it here, if only to give confirmation.","1288":"My presupposition was that when the planet, in its eccentric position, is truly at the node, it can by no disposition of the earth or sun be made to appear elsewhere than at the node.","1289":"For in the Copernican hypothesis, this in itself is in agreement with the nature of things: that the moving faculty of any star is not bound to observe a star foreign to it (including the earth), but has its own laws governing its circuit.","1290":"In the Ptolemaic hypothesis, this would be exactly as if one were to say that the epicycle pays heed, not to a line from the sun through its own center, but to certain positions beneath the fixed stars, beneath which  it places the planet in the plane of the ecliptic.","1291":"In the Tychonic system, the same will be said of the eccentric.","1292":"Further, that which I presupposed, I have found to be true using the following observations:","1293":"On 1590 March 4 at 7h 10m in the evening, Mars's declination was 9\u00b0 26\u2019","1294":"N, and the right ascension was 22\u00b0 35\u2019 10\u201d ^2.","1295":"Hence, its position comes out as 24\u00b0 22\u2019 56\u201d Aries, and its latitude as 3\u2019 12\u201d south.","1296":"Parallax and refraction were opposite and approximately equal, and are therefore ignored.","1297":"On 1592 January 23 at 10h 15m in the evening, Mars was at 11\u00b0 34\u2019 30\u201d Aries with latitude 0\u00b0 2\u2019 south ^3.","1298":"The altitude of Mars was 25\u00b0, and therefore (from the table for the fixed stars),4 there was no refraction.","1299":"The parallax was about as much as the sun's, because Mars and the sun were sextile, and were therefore about equally distant from earth ^5.","1300":"Nearly all of this was latitudinal.","1301":"Therefore, about two minutes of latitude must be added northward to Mars in order to free it from parallax, and it thus will fall upon the ecliptic.","1302":"For on February 6 it was already at about 7\u2019 northern latitude ^6.","1303":"On the evening of 1593 December 10, Mars was observed at the ascending node.","1304":"For after correction of the horizontal variations it retained no more than 0\u00b0 0\u2019 45\u201d north latitude ^7.","1305":"On 1595 October 27 at 12h 20m, Mars's true latitude after the removal of parallax was 0\u00b0 2\u2019 20\u201d south ^8.","1306":"On the 28th, when the parallax had similarly been removed, the latitude was 0\u00b0 0\u2019 25\u201d north ^9.","1307":"Therefore,*  in the meanwhile, it was at the ascending node.","1308":"Counting backwards 687 days, the number of days in Mars\u2019s revolution on its eccentric, starting from noon on 28 October, the end will fall on 1593 December 10, while on the preceding night Mars was observed near the node.","1309":"Count back another 687.","1310":"This will end up at 1592 January 23, when the planet was observed right at the node.","1311":"If you do the same a third time, you will come out at 1590 March 7, while on the fourth day preceding, Mars had some southern latitude, which it would make up over the four days, so as to fall at the node about the seventh.","1312":"From this it is known that it makes no difference where the earth is, either in sidereal position or with respect to Mars.","1313":"In the Ptolemaic system, it makes no difference where the sun is with respect to the center of Mars\u2019s epicycle and where Mars is on the epicycle, and in the Tychonic system, it makes no difference where the center of the eccentric or the sun is located with respect to the line from Mars through the earth, so drawn that Mars lies in the plane of the ecliptic.","1314":"For the diameter of the nodes is always the same in Copernicus and Ptolemy, and in Tycho it is always parallel to itself, except that over the ages the nodes move slightly.","1315":"This motion was not perceived over these six years.","1316":"Now let us find the opposite node.","1317":"I. On the morning of 1595 January 4, when Mars was observed at 7h 10m at altitude 8\u00b0, with reference to Spica Virginis and Cor Scorpii,10 it was observed at latitude 0\u00b0 3\u2019 46\u201d N, and it was itself at 13\u00b0 36\u2019 40\u201d Sagittarius ^11.","1318":"The  parallax is small, because Mars was more than twice as far from the earth as is the sun.","1319":"Refraction, on the other hand, is large: 6\u2019 45\u201d from the table for the fixed stars, or 11 minutes from the table for the sun ^12.","1320":"This is nearly all latitudinal, owing to the low altitude of the nonagesimal ^13.","1321":"Therefore, Mars (reckoning by the refraction displayed by the sun) was really at a few minutes south latitude\u2014about 2 or 3, or even more.","1322":"II.","1323":"On the night of 1589 April 15 Mars's observed latitude was 1\u00b0 7\u2019 north ^14.","1324":"The parallax of the annual orb was drastically increased, owing to the approach of Mars and earth.","1325":"After 21 days, the latitude decreased to a paltry 6\u2154\u2019 north ^15.","1326":"And thus, although on May 6 it decreased somewhat more slowly, since the star was moving away from the earth, we shall still not be far wrong if we extrapolate proportionally: we make 21 days be to the number of days after which Mars falls upon the ecliptic, as 60 minutes of diminution is to the 6\u2154 minutes remaining.","1327":"This rule shows it to be two and one third days, so that Mars was at the node on May 9.","1328":"Once again, counting thrice 687 days thence, we will come out on 1594 December 30.","1329":"On this day, Mars ought to have been at the node, and for the next 5 days\u2014up to the morning of January 4\u2014it should have been moving off southward.","1330":"And indeed, from observations of it on January 4, we have given it a few minutes of south latitude.","1331":"Mars was not observed more frequently at this eccentric position.","1332":"It is enough that we have this 1595 observation, provided that it does not disagree with us.","1333":"In 1589 there is nothing that we can bring into question.","1334":"Nor should it disturb you that in 1589 we assigned a latitudinal motion of 6\u2154\u2019 to 2\u2153 days, while we do not allow so much over a 5-day period around 1595 January 4.","1335":"For, as will appear in the course of this work, the latitude is most attenuated at conjunction with the sun (as in 1595), owing to the parallaxes of the annual orb, and at opposition (as in 1589) it is augmented.","1336":"It is therefore fitting that the diurnal motion in latitude appear less in 1595, and greater in 1589.","1337":"Now, how are the sidereal positions of the two nodes found?","1338":"Thus: one finds an approximate value for the mean position of Mars at each place, using tables for Mars (which, accordingly, we presuppose for this purpose).","1339":"Whether you do this with the help of the Prutenic or Tychonic tables, taking into account the true precession of the equinox, you will find that on the morning of 1594 December 30, the mean position of Mars is 27\u00b0 14\u00bd\u2019 Scorpio, and on the morning of 1595 October 28 it was at 5\u00b0 31\u2019 Taurus.","1340":"It therefore appears that the diameter of the nodes does not pass through the center of equable motion,16 but far beneath it.","1341":"For from 5\u00b0 31\u2019 Taurus to 27\u00b0 14\u00bd\u2019 Scorpio is more than from the latter to the former.","1342":"If, on the other hand, you make use of the Tychonic equations, 11\u00b0 17\u2019 must be added to the latter figure and 11\u00b0 30\u2019 subtracted from the former.","1343":"Accordingly, the one comes out to be 15\u00b0 44\u00bd\u2019 Scorpio, and the other, 16\u00b0 48\u2019 Taurus, which are Mars\u2019s equated eccentric positions ^17.","1344":"As you see, the nodes are nearly opposite one another at about 16\u2153\u02da Taurus and Scorpio, when viewed from the center of the planetary system, which Ptolemy described as a point very near the earth, and Copernicus and Tycho as a point very near the sun.","1345":"Further, it will be seen in Part 5 below how much we are going to change these positions of the nodes when we change the equations by transposing the theory of the sun from the sun's mean position to its apparent position.","1346":"Chapter 13","1347":"Investigation of the inclination of the planes of the ecliptic and of the orbit of Mars.","1348":"In the previous chapter, the nodes and limits have been found quite accurately according to the opinions of Tycho Brahe and myself.","1349":"Now it is to be inquired what exactly the inclination of the plane of Mars\u2019s orbit is to the plane of the ecliptic.","1350":"It is not so evident how to deduce this from the observations themselves.","1351":"For the angle of this inclination is set up around the center of the planetary system, which for Copernicus and Tycho is the sun.","1352":"But the eye cannot be placed at the sun so that this inclination might thence appear beneath the fixed stars and be measured, and the maximum distance of the limit from the ecliptic, seen from another place, will also be seen under another angle.","1353":"In the Ptolemaic form there might appear to be a more direct procedure, but this is not so.","1354":"For it will be demonstrated that the plane of the epicycle always remains parallel to the plane of the ecliptic.","1355":"Therefore, place the center of the plane of the epicycle at either limit, and let the planet lie on the same line of longitude passing from the center of vision through the center of the epicycle.","1356":"The planet will then either be more distant than the center of the epicycle from the observer, and thus its distance from the ecliptic will appear less than the distance of the center of the epicycle from the same ecliptic, or it will be nearer to the observer, and will thus appear greater than what we seek.","1357":"In this difficulty we may take consolation from this one circumstance: that the purpose for which we seek to know the inclination as one of our principles is not such as to require the highest accuracy.","1358":"It will consequently permit us to use those means which furnish indirect evidence of the quantity of the inclination: we shall offer three of these.","1359":"Now it is apparent from what has just been said that it will be most directly helpful to us if we find an observation of the star Mars at that moment at which Mars is reported to be equidistant from the sun and the earth and on the line drawn from the sun to 16\u00b0 or 17\u00b0 Leo or Aquarius (the positions of the limits).","1360":"In the Ptolemaic form, this is where the center of the epicycle is at 16\u00b0 or 17\u00b0 Leo or Aquarius and Mars is as far from the earth as is the center of the epicycle.","1361":"In Mercury alone this problem does not occur.","1362":"Let B be the sun, A the earth, and upon AB let the isosceles triangle ABC be set up, with C the planet\u2019s position in the plane of the ecliptic; and, CE being drawn perpendicular to the orbit of Mars, let the body of Mars be at E. EC will therefore appear the same whether seen from B the sun or A the earth \u2014this is immediately evident.","1363":"But in order that it be known at what position Mars is equidistant from the sun and the earth, observe that when the lines from Mars at C and the earth at A falling upon the sun at B make the angle CBA right, then CB is shorter than CA.","1364":"Consequently, BA, the position opposite the sun\u2019s, should make with BC, the eccentric position of Mars, an angle less than 90\u00b0, in order that CAB and CBA be equal.","1365":"Therefore, if BC is directed toward 17 Leo, the sun ought to be beyond 17 Taurus and before 17 Scorpio.","1366":"Or if on the contrary BC is directed toward 17 Aquarius, the sun should be beyond 17 Scorpio and before 17 Taurus.","1367":"We use these circumlocutions to denote morning  risings or evening settings, with Mars and the sun sextile or quintile ^1.","1368":"In the Ptolemaic form, if C be the earth, A the center of the epicycle, and B Mars, CAB will not be able to be right, as CA and CB are to be made equal.","1369":"So the anomaly of commutation2 ought to be more than 90\u00b0 or less than 270\u00b0.","1370":"If you wish to work a little more precisely, take from Copernicus or from an anticipation of Tycho\u2019s reformation the approximate ratio 1525:1000 as (in Copernicus) the ratio of the orbits of Mars and earth, (in Tycho) of Mars and the sun, or (in Ptolemy) of the eccentric and the epicycle.","1371":"At 16\u00b0 or 17\u00b0 Leo, this is about 5:3, and at 16\u00b0 or 17\u00b0 Aquarius, about 11:8.","1372":"So the triangle ACB is isosceles with sides AC, CB equal, and (with AB=1000), BC is 1666\u2154 when directed toward 17\u00b0 Leo.","1373":"Therefore (CD being dropped perpendicular to AB), where AD, which is half AB, is 1000, AC will be 3333\u2153.","1374":"Looking this up in a table of secants, we find the angles CAD and CBD to be 72\u00b0 33\u2019.","1375":"So also, at 16\u00b0 or 17\u00b0 Aquarius, with AB=1000, AC is 1375, so if AD=1000, AC is 2750, showing 68\u00b0 40\u2019 in the table of secants.","1376":"Therefore, with BC directed towards 16\u00b0 or 17\u00b0 Leo or thereabouts, the apparent position of Mars, AC, ought to be 72\u00bd\u00b0 from the apparent position of the sun AB.","1377":"And with BC at 16\u00b0 or 17\u00b0 Aquarius, these ought to be 68\u2154 from one another.","1378":"And since the sum of the two (CAB, CBA) at 17\u00b0 Leo is 145\u00b0, ACB will be 35\u00b0 at 17\u00b0 Leo.","1379":"Wherefore, Mars, which lies on the line AC, ought to be seen at 22\u00b0 Virgo (the sun being on AB at 5\u00b0 Sagittarius), or at 12\u00b0 Cancer (the sun being at 30\u00b0 Aries).","1380":"Similarly, at 17\u00b0 Aquarius, since the sum (CAB, CBA) is 137\u2153, ACB will be 42\u2154\u00b0, wherefore Mars, lying on the line AC, ought to be seen at 24\u2153\u02da Sagittarius3 (the sun being on AB at 16\u00b0 Libra) or at 0\u00b0 Aries (the sun being at 9\u00b0 Gemini).","1381":"Something approximating this could have happened, first, in November of 1586 or 1588; again, in April of 1581, 1583, 1596, and 1598; third, in September or October of 1587 and 1589; and fourth, in May or June of 1580, 1582, 1595, and 1597.","1382":"In the last instance, suitable observations are lacking, since Mars in Aries, on account of its small ascension (where the sun in Gemini makes the nights bright) can hardly be observed, or even be seen at all.","1383":"Accordingly, on 1588 November 10 at 6h 30m in the morning the planet Mars was seen at 25\u00b0 31\u2019 Virgo, with a latitude of 1\u00b0 36\u2019 45\u201d north, the sun being at 21 Scorpio ^4.","1384":"The sun is thus only 62\u00bd\u02da from Mars, although it should have been 72\u00b0 from Mars in order to make the triangle isosceles, as the problem requires.","1385":"Therefore, Mars is then farther from the earth than from the sun.","1386":"Consequently, its latitude at that place appeared less than was the true inclination.","1387":"On December 5 following, at 6h in the morning, Mars was seen at 9\u00b0 19\u2156\u2019 Libra, with a latitude of 1\u00b0 53\u00bd\u2019 N., the sun being at 23\u00b0 Sagittarius ^5.","1388":"Therefore, since the sun was 73\u00bd\u00b0 from Mars, the digression of the point which Mars then occupied on its orbit was a little less than 1\u00b0 53\u00bd\u2019 (since there should have been  72\u00b0 between Mars and the sun).","1389":"Since the present angle is greater, the distance of Mars from the earth turns out to be less than the distance of Mars from the sun.","1390":"The apparent magnitude of the inclination\u2014at least, of this point from the plane of the ecliptic\u2014is consequently greater.","1391":"But since on December 5 the planet in its eccentric motion was already several degrees beyond the limit, again diminishing its true digression from the ecliptic, this was consequently greater right at the limit.","1392":"And since these two effects cancel one another, the maximum inclination of the planes will be about 1\u00b0 50\u2019.","1393":"Similarly, on 1586 October 22 at 6h in the morning, about dawn, there was about 6\u00b0 9\u2019 eastward between Mars and Cor Leonis ^6.","1394":"The declination of Mars from the equator was 13\u00b0 0\u2019 40\u201d north.","1395":"Hence, its apparent longitude is found to be 0\u00b0 7\u2019 Virgo,7 latitude 1\u00b0 36\u2019 6\u201d N ^8.","1396":"The sun stood at 8\u00b0 Scorpio, 68\u00b0 from Mars.","1397":"It should have been farther.","1398":"Consequently, the line between Mars and the earth was longer than that between Mars and the sun.","1399":"And so the apparent latitude was less than the true digression of the planet from the ecliptic, and this was, in fact, long before it reached the limit.","1400":"But on November 2 at 4\u2154h in the morning, with the sun at 19\u2156\u00b0 Scorpio, Mars was seen at 5\u00b0 52\u2019 Virgo, with latitude 1\u00b0 47\u2019 N ^9.","1401":"The sun was 73\u00bd\u00b0 from Mars, by a nearly exact measure.","1402":"But Mars was a few degrees before its northern limit which is at about 16\u00b0 17\u2019.","1403":"Therefore the latitude at this position appeared about right, although exactly at the limit it is reckoned to be greater than 1\u00b0 47\u2019, namely, about 1\u00b0 50\u2019.","1404":"On December 1 following, at 7\u00bdh in the morning, the equatorial distance10 between Cor Leonis and Mars was 25\u00b0 12\u00bc\u2019, and Mars\u2019s declination was 6\u00b0 2\u00bc ^11.","1405":"Hence is found its longitude, 20\u00b0 4\u2019 30\u201d Virgo, and latitude, 2\u00b0 16\u2019 30\u201d, with the sun at 18\u00b0 Sagittarius, which is 88\u00b0 from Mars.","1406":"It should have been only 72\u00bd.\u00b0 Therefore the line between Mars and the earth is made less than that between Mars and the sun, and because of the lesser distance, the digression appeared greater than it really was.","1407":"At this point, therefore, the digression from the ecliptic was less than 2\u00b0 16\u00bd\u2019.","1408":"Indeed, it was much less, but not thereby much greater than 1\u00b0 47\u2019.","1409":"So here the magnitude of the maximum inclination is indirectly confirmed to be 1\u00b0 50\u2019.","1410":"On the other hand, on 1583 April 22, at 9\u00beh in the night, an interval of 20\u00b0 58\u2019 was observed between Mars and the Dog12 and 22\u00b0 47\u00bd\u2019 between Mars and Cor Leonis ^13.","1411":"Hence, the position of Mars is found to be 1\u00b0 17\u2019 Leo, with latitude 1\u00b0 50\u2154\u2019 north.","1412":"The sun was at 11\u00b0 Taurus, 80\u00b0 distant from Mars.","1413":"This should have been 72\u00bd\u00b0.","1414":"Accordingly, Mars is closer than it should be.","1415":"Therefore, its observed latitude is greater than its true digression from the ecliptic.","1416":"But Mars is more than twenty-one degrees beyond the northern limit.","1417":"So at the limit, is digression will again be greater.","1418":"Therefore, the opposite causes again cancel one another, and the maximum inclination is 1\u00b0 50\u2019.","1419":"Likewise, at 8h in the evening on 1596 March 9, it was observed at 15\u00b0 49\u2019 Gemini, with latitude 1\u00b0 49\u2154\u2019 north ^14.","1420":"The sun was at 30\u00b0 Pisces, 76 degrees from Mars.","1421":"It should have been a little closer.","1422":"Therefore, Mars\u2019s true digression from the ecliptic was a little less than the observed latitude.","1423":"However, this digression was not at its maximum, since Mars had not yet approached within about 25 degrees of the limit.","1424":"So once again, indirect support is provided for a maximum digression of about 1\u00b0 50\u2019 at the limit.","1425":"Now, at the other limit, at 17\u00b0 Aquarius, although observations are rarer,  there is one available.","1426":"On 1589 September 15 at 7\u00bch in the evening, Mars was observed at 16\u00b0 47\u2153\u2019 Sagittarius with 1\u00b0 41\u2154\u2019 southern latitude ^15.","1427":"But when the correction for refraction of light which it underwent at this low altitude is applied, its position was 16\u00b0 45\u2154\u2019, with latitude 1\u00b0 52\u2153\u2019 south.","1428":"The sun was at 2\u00b0 Libra, 74\u2153\u00b0 distant from Mars.","1429":"It ought to have been only 68\u2154\u00b0.","1430":"Therefore, the observed latitude is a little greater than the digression of its position from the ecliptic.","1431":"However, that is not the most distant point, as it is several degrees before the limit.","1432":"Therefore here, too, the effects cancel.","1433":"On November 1 following, at 6\u2159h, it was seen at 20\u00b0 59\u00bc Capricorn, with latitude 1\u00b0 36\u2019 south, the sun being at 19\u00b0 Scorpio ^16.","1434":"While it was then no more than 62\u00b0 from Mars, it should have been 68\u2154.","1435":"Therefore, the apparent latitude is less than the true digression from the ecliptic.","1436":"But at the same time, the digression at this point is less than the digression at the limit, because this point is beyond the limit.","1437":"Therefore, the maximum inclination is much greater than 1\u00b0 36\u2019, and by all indications is about as great as the apparent latitude on September 15, namely, 1\u00b0 50\u2019, approximately.","1438":"I have carried through one method, in which a knowledge of the approximate proportion of the orbs is presupposed.","1439":"The observations followed this method within the limits of calculation, indicating readily enough the maximum inclination of the planes.","1440":"I shall now present another method, for which rarer, more select observations are required.","1441":"If these are to be had, what we are seeking is found without prior knowledge of the ratio of the orbs and this without the encumbrance of a laborious computation.","1442":"When two planes cut one another, any two lines drawn in the respective planes to the same point on the line of intersection and at right angles to that line always include one and the same angle.","1443":"Let the plane of the ecliptic be ACDB, the plane of Mars\u2019s orbit AEFB, and let them intersect one another in AB.","1444":"Let the sun be at A, the earth at B, and from A and B, perpendicular to AB, let AC and BD be set up in the plane of the ecliptic, and AE and BF in the orbit of Mars.","1445":"Let the planet be at F. The inclination EAC of the limit E will be equal to the apparent latitude of the planet at F, namely, FBD.","1446":"You will therefore note that if ever there is a perfect quadrature of the sun and Mars, with the line BA, that is, the sun, at 16\u00b0 or 17\u00b0 Taurus or 16\u00b0 or 17\u00b0 Scorpio\u2014where between the line BA from earth to sun (which in this instance is also the line of intersection of the planes), and the line BF from earth to Mars, there is 90\u00b0 or one quadrant intervening\u2014then, whatever the apparent latitude of Mars FBD will be there, that will also be the maximum inclination of the planes EAC, although at that place F, Mars is not as far from the ecliptic as at E.","1447":"The first such day fell on 1583 April 22, which only just now I had under consideration.","1448":"The sun was at 11 Taurus, five or six degrees below the node.","1449":"The earth, therefore, was above the line of intersection towards Mars.","1450":"On this  account, the apparent latitude will be greater than the truth, since it is seen from nearer.","1451":"On the other hand, since there are not 90\u00b0 between the sun and Mars, the apparent latitude will on this account be less than the truth.","1452":"On the supposition that these opposite deviations cancel one another, the inclination of the planes will approximately equal the observed latitude.","1453":"The observed latitude was 1\u00b0 50\u2154\u2019.","1454":"Therefore, the inclination of the planes is approximately that much.","1455":"On 1584 October 30, there was a select occasion, but no observation is available.","1456":"However, on November 12 following, at 1\u00bdh in the night, when the sun had already fallen about 14\u00b0 or 15\u00b0 below the diameter of intersection, the earth having risen that much (for Copernicus), or the diameter of intersection having fallen that much toward the earth (for Tycho), Mars was seen at 23\u00b0 14\u2019 Leo with latitude 2\u00b0 12\u2156\u2019 north, while the sun was at 1\u00b0 Sagittarius ^17.","1457":"This angle is somewhat diminished owing to the inclination of Mars\u2019s line of vision to the line of intersection.","1458":"But it is greatly augmented by its approach toward the earth.","1459":"Therefore, the inclination is much less than 2\u00b0 12\u2019, namely, 1\u00b0 50\u2019.","1460":"On 1585 April 26 at 9h 42m, Mars was seen at 21\u00b0 26\u2019 Leo with latitude 1\u00b0 49\u00be\u2019 north ^18.","1461":"The sun was at 16\u00b0 Taurus, right near the node.","1462":"Mars\u2019s line of vision was a little inclined, since Mars was beyond 16\u00b0 Leo.","1463":"Therefore, the angle of maximum inclination of the planes was only a little greater than 1\u00b0 49\u00be\u2019; that is, 1\u00b0 50\u2019 or a little greater.","1464":"Similarly, near the other limit, on 1591 October 16 at 6h 30m in the evening, Mars was seen at 1\u00b0 27\u2153\u2019 Aquarius with latitude 2\u00b0 10\u215a\u2019 south, decreasing ^19.","1465":"(For on October 10 preceding, the latitude was 2\u00b0 18\u2154\u2019,20 and on October 2 it was 2\u00b0 38\u00bd\u2018.)","1466":"The sun was at 2\u00bd\u00b0 Scorpio, above the node.","1467":"The earth was therefore below the node towards Mars.","1468":"So because of this proximity, the observed latitude was greater than the inclination of the plane of the ecliptic.","1469":"Fourteen days later, when the sun was at the node, if it were again to have decreased 28 minutes (the amount of decrease in the previous 14 days), there would remain 1\u00b0 45\u2019.","1470":"But the ratio of decrease does not remain the same when the earth departs from a star, or vice versa.","1471":"For at a greater distance the decrease is always less.","1472":"Therefore nothing can be adduced here against a maximum inclination of 1\u00b0 50\u2019.","1473":"On the contrary: it is indirectly confirmed.","1474":"The demonstration can be extended farther.","1475":"Let BA be a line drawn from the earth through the body of the sun at the place of the node, 17\u00b0 Scorpio or Taurus, and let the planet be observed at any point whatever on the zodiac.","1476":"Now the latitude which it appears to have measures the inclination of a point on the plane truly removed from the limit by an amount equal to Mars\u2019s apparent removal from the limit.","1477":"Let Mars be observed on BG.","1478":"Draw AH parallel to it.","1479":"The apparent latitude of point G seen from B will be the same as the inclination of point H. And BG and AH are directed towards the same sidereal degree, because they are parallel.","1480":"For example, in the observation of 1585 April 26, the sun was at 16\u00b0 Taurus, and Mars was observed at 21\u00b0 26\u2019 Leo, with latitude 1\u00b0 49\u00be\u2019.","1481":"Therefore, the inclination at the eccentric motion of 21\u00b0 26\u2019 Leo is 1\u00b0 49\u00be\u2019.","1482":"And since 21\u00b0 26\u2019 Leo is 5\u00b0 from the limit, and the sine of 85\u00b0 is 1\/250 less than the whole sine,21 the maximum inclination here will be greater by 1\/250 of it, that is, about 1\u00b0 50\u00bd\u2018.","1483":"In the Ptolemaic hypothesis, the demonstration of this theorem proceeds  on the following basis.","1484":"Let A be the earth, AB the line through the sun and the point opposite, at 17\u00b0 Taurus or Scorpio, AD Mars\u2019s line of vision, D Mars, and BAD a right angle.","1485":"AD will accordingly be at 17\u00b0 Leo or Aquarius.","1486":"And because D is Mars, a line drawn from D parallel to BA will pass through the center of the epicycle C (since the motion of Mars on its epicycle follows the motion of the sun in its orb).","1487":"Take a point E on AD such that AE equals AC.","1488":"Therefore, since AC will not be at 17\u00b0 Leo or Aquarius, it will not be so far from the ecliptic as the northern limit E. D will likewise not stand so far from the ecliptic as E, because CD and all the points of the epicycle are equally distant from the ecliptic, since the plane of the epicycle, in order to make the hypothesis equivalent, is supposed always to remain parallel to the plane of the ecliptic.","1489":"But proportionally as D or C is less distant from the ecliptic than E, D is closer to A than E, with the result that the distance D may be seen from A as proportionally greater, and both may be seen under the same angle from A. Now, according to spherical trigonometry, as the distance of C from the ecliptic is to the distance of E from the ecliptic, so is the sine of arc CB (that is, AD) to the whole sine AE, because ECB is a circle inclined above AB.","1490":"But C and D are equally distant from the ecliptic, as was just said.","1491":"Therefore, AD is to AE as the distance of D (or the perpendicular drawn from D to the ecliptic) is to the perpendicular from E. Therefore, the triangles ADD and AEE will be similar, since they have right angles at points D and E on the ecliptic, and the sides are proportional.","1492":"Also, they will be concurrent, since the sides (AD, AE) are drawn in the plane of the ecliptic through the same point A, and are directed toward the same point of longitude, 17\u00b0 Leo or Aquarius.","1493":"Therefore, the lines AD, AE in the orbit are also concurrent; that is, the line extended from the earth A through Mars D at this position will hit upon E, the center of the epicycle, when it is at the limit.","1494":"Thus the angles of maximum inclination and of observed latitude of Mars will be the same at this place.","1495":"A third way depends upon computation and upon prior knowledge of the ratio of the orbs.","1496":"We shall have a taste of this one only for the sake of confirmation.","1497":"A true and accurate treatment is reserved for Part V and ch.","1498":"63, and is not required here.","1499":"In Tycho\u2019s table of oppositions, the apparent latitude at 21\u00b0 16\u2019 Leo was 4\u00b0 32\u2159\u201922","1500":"Let A be the sun, B the earth, C Mars on the eccentric.","1501":"Thus the line AE running out through the earth B among the fixed stars will intersect the ecliptic, and AC will intersect the orbit of Mars.","1502":"And since Mars is at 21\u00b0 Leo, near the limit, the angle EAC is near its maximum.","1503":"I track this down as follows.","1504":"Let BA be 1000, AC 1664, and EBC 4\u00b0 32\u2159\u2019.","1505":"Therefore, as AC is to EBC, so is BA to BCA, 2\u00b0 43\u2019 27\u201c ^23.","1506":"This, subtracted from EBC, leaves the required angle BAC, 1\u00b0 48\u2019 43\u201c; hence, right at the limit, it would be about 1\u00b0 49\u2019 and is somewhat altered if the ratio BA to AC is altered (more on this below).","1507":"In this manner, from any given acronychal observation with a comparatively great latitude, the inclination is found, first, of that point on the orbit, and then at its maximum, by considering the distance from the node or limit.","1508":"For example, on 1593 August 24, the apparent latitude at opposition to the sun comes out to be 6\u00b0 3\u2019 south ^24.","1509":"Mars was at 12\u00bd\u00b0 Pisces.","1510":"Now let BA be 1000 and AC 1389, from our prior knowledge.","1511":"As CA is to the sine of CBE, BA is to the sine of BCA, 4\u00b0 21\u2019 10\u201c.","1512":"Subtracting from CBE, this leaves the required angle BAC, 1\u00b0 41\u2019 50\u201c.","1513":"However, this position is about 26\u00b0 from the limit, 64\u00b0 from the node.","1514":"So, as the sine of 64\u00b0 is to this digression from the ecliptic of 1\u00b0 42\u2019, so is the whole sine to the maximum inclination of the planes, which comes out to be 1\u00b0 53\u2019.","1515":"We need not be concerned about the three minutes\u2019 excess, for they arise from the assumed ratio, for which see Part IV below.","1516":"In the Ptolemaic form, A will be the earth, C the center of Mars\u2019s epicycle, and D the lowest point on the epicycle, since Mars is situated at opposition to the sun.","1517":"And because the sun\u2019s line EA is on the ecliptic, while the plane of the epicycle is set up parallel to the plane of the ecliptic, CD will be parallel to EA.","1518":"Therefore, BAC and ACD, the inclinations of the eccentric and the epicycle, are equal.","1519":"But, owing to the full equivalence of the hypotheses, CD is equal to BA; that is, as AB is to AC in Copernicus, so is the semidiameter of the Ptolemaic epicycle DC to CA, the line from the earth to the center of the epicycle.","1520":"Therefore, CDA and CBA are equal, and EBC and BAD are equal: the apparent latitude.","1521":"Chapter 14","1522":"The planes of the eccentrics are non-liberating ^1.","1523":"The convolutions of Ptolemy\u2019s hypothesis forced him to accumulate many monstrosities in the theory of latitudes.","1524":"For when he decided to make the plane of the epicycle tip every which way (it not being immediately clear, through the mists of his hypothesis, that the plane of the epicycle is parallel to the plane of the ecliptic), he contrived the latitude from three components, and in order that contraries counterbalance one another,*  utterly wrenched his epicycle from its parallel position.","1525":"He did not choose to find average values, whether on the grounds that his observations were not closely spaced, or that he distrusted those that were so, and hence accepted extreme values which were in error.","1526":"As a consequence, you may see that in the usual computation (e.g., in Magini\u2019s Ephemerides) there is no conjunction whatever of Mars and the sun that is not,  as they say, \u201cthrough the body\u201c.","1527":"If this were true, it would been in vain that nature devised latitudinal temperings, which prevent the excessive arousal of the sublunar powers that often repeated physical conjunctions would cause.","1528":"Copernicus, ignorant of his own riches, ever took it upon himself to express Ptolemy, not the nature of things, to which, nonetheless, he of all men came closest.","1529":"(In this regard, see Rheticus\u2019s Narratio prima.)","1530":"For although he rejoiced to find that when the earth approaches a celestial body, the apparent latitudes are increased, he still did not dare to reject the remaining Ptolemaic increases in the latitudes (which this approach of the earth would not bring about).","1531":"Instead, in order to reproduce these as well, he fabricated librations of the planes of the eccentrics, in which the angle of inclination (which for  Ptolemy was fixed) would be varied.","1532":"Moreover, in a manner close to being monstrous, this happens not according to the laws of motion2 of its own eccentric, but to those of the earth\u2019s orb, clearly foreign.","1533":"See Copernicus Book VI Ch.","1534":"1.","1535":"Armed by my own skepticism, I always opposed this gratuitous connection of diverse orbs as a cause of motion, even before seeing Tycho\u2019s observations.","1536":"In this I more greatly congratulate myself that the observations were found to stand in agreement with me, as has happened with many other preconceived opinions.","1537":"But lest anyone deem me untrustworthy on this very account, claiming that I would treat the observations with prejudice, let him now witness that I","1538":"have most solidly demonstrated that there are no liberations in the inclination of the eccentric.","1539":"For three ways of investigating the maximum inclination were proposed.","1540":"In the first, the sun was near Mars\u2019s sextiles and quintiles,3 that is, about as close to Mars\u2019s conjunction as it could be and still allow Mars to be conveniently seen and observed.","1541":"In the second, it was near quadrature with Mars, and in the third it was right opposite Mars.","1542":"But when the sun was at all three places, Mars exhibited one and the same maximum inclination (1\u00b0 50\u2019, about), northwards, at the same place on its eccentric, and the same amount southwards at the opposite position.","1543":"Likewise, in Ch.","1544":"12, it appeared that when Mars was near the nodes of its motion on the eccentric, no matter what position the sun occupied on its orb (whether near Mars or far from it), Mars was never seen to have any latitude.","1545":"And in the fifth part below it will be proved in many ways that the declination of Mars\u2019s orbit from the ecliptic is constant at any particular position on its orbit.","1546":"And so let us conclude with great certainty that the inclination of the planes of the eccentrics to the ecliptic does not vary at all.","1547":"(For why should I not form a general conclusion, seeing that there is no reason why it should exist in only a single planet?","1548":"Even so, I have demonstrated the same for both Venus and Mercury from the observations.)","1549":"And a follower of Ptolemy may learn from this that the plane of the epicycle is always parallel to the plane of the ecliptic.","1550":"For this is already demonstrated where the center is near the limits, and it was proved above in Ch.","1551":"12 that when the center is near the nodes, the epicycle lies entirely on the ecliptic.","1552":"Now who will set me up a fountain of tears, by which, for his deserts, I might bewail the pathetic industry of Apianus, who in his Opus Caesarium,4  following his trust in Ptolemy, spent so many hours and wasted so many ingenious meditations trying to express, by means of spirals and corollae and helices and volutes and a vast labyrinth of the most intricate curves, a human figment which the nature of things clearly disowns?","1553":"But that man shows us that he was easily capable of equaling nature by the divine talents of his most perspicacious wits.","1554":"Apart from this, he entertained his mind with these tricks (in which he rivaled nature herself), which were thoroughly mastered and assembled in his models, and he has consequently won the prize of undying fame,5 whatever diminishment fortune herself might have in store for the works themselves.","1555":"But what are we to say of the empty artistry6 of those who made the devices?7 For they make six hundred, nay rather twelve hundred little wheels, so they can triumph in the presentation of the latitudes (that is, human figments thereof) in their works, and claim the consequent reward.","1556":"Chapter 15","1557":"Reduction of observed positions at either end of the night to the fine of the sun\u2019s apparent motion1","1558":"Now, with that investigation carried through to

positions which a planet may occupy on its orbit when the sun itself is diametrically opposite it.","1559":"The years 1580 and 1597 may be omitted from the argument, as they present no suitable evidence owing to uncertainty of the observations ^2.","1560":"Suppose, however, that on 1580 November 12 at 10h 50m Mars was observed at 8\u00b0 37\u2019 Gemini,3 and the motion over five days was 1\u00b0 55\u2019.","1561":"Since at the given time the sun stood at 0\u00b0 45\u2019 36\u201c Sagittarius, and its motion over five days is 5\u00b0 5\u2019, the sum of the two motions will come to 7\u00b0 0\u2019.","1562":"But the sun is 7\u00b0 51\u2019 24\u201c removed from opposition to Mars.","1563":"Of this, seven degrees exactly are traversed in 5 days, or 120 hours.","1564":"So, according to the same ratio, the remaining 51\u2019 24\u201c will be traversed in 14 hours 41 minutes.","1565":"Therefore, the moment of opposition was November 18 at 1h 31m.","1566":"Its position was 6\u00b0 28\u2019 Gemini on the ecliptic.","1567":"Now this is 20\u00b0 away from 16\u00bd\u00b0 Taurus.","1568":"I want to know how much longer this makes the arc on the orbit extended from the node to the arc of  latitude through 6\u00b0 28\u2019 Gemini.","1569":"So I turn to Philip Lansberg\u2019s trigonometry ^4.","1570":"I mention him out of honor and gratitude, for he has supplied me in abundance with the finest axes, best adapted for building astronomical foundations, from nearby, and at little expense of time.","1571":"Without him, these would have had to be sought from afar with great deal of trouble and toil, and the handles would not have been so well fitted.","1572":"From Lansberge, then, the tangent of the 20\u00b0 side multiplied by the secant of the angle of inclination, 1\u00b0 50\u2019, the last five digits being dropped,5 gives an increase of only 18\u00bd of the smallest units, to which corresponds about 35 seconds.","1573":"Mars therefore, standing opposite 6\u00b0 28\u2019 Gemini, is 35\u201c further along on its orbit.","1574":"It should therefore be placed at 6\u00b0 28\u2019 35\u201c Gemini, a tiny and quite unnecessary correction.","1575":"The latitude is 1\u00b0 40\u2019 north.","1576":"On the night following 1582 December 28, at 11h 30m, Mars was observed at 16\u00b0 47\u2019 Cancer,6 while the true position of the sun was 17\u00b0 13\u2019 45\u201c Capricorn.","1577":"The moment of opposition had therefore passed.","1578":"Now the sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 61\u2019 18\u201c, that of Mars 24\u2019, and their sum, 85\u2019 18\u201c.","1579":"At this moment, the distance between the stars was 26\u2019 45\u201c.","1580":"Therefore, as 1\u00b0 25\u2019 18\u201c is to 24 hours, so is 26\u2019 45\u201c to 7 hours 32 minutes.","1581":"Subtracting this from 11 hours 30 minutes gives December 28 at 3h 58m after noon as the moment of true opposition.","1582":"Its position on the ecliptic was 16\u00b0 54\u2019 32\u201c Cancer, and by reduction to the orbit (a 50\u201c correction), 16\u00b0 55\u00bd\u2019 Cancer.","1583":"The latitude was 4\u00b0 6\u2019 north, as given by Brahe\u2019s table of oppositions.","1584":"For among the observations I find various latitudes: on the night following December 26, 4\u00b0 6\u2019 or 4\u00b0 2\u2019, while on the night following December 29, 4\u00b0 8\u2019 or 4\u00b0 6\u00bd\u2019.","1585":"On 1585 January 31 at 12h 0m, Mars was observed at 21\u00b0 18\u2019 11\u201c Leo ^7.","1586":"The sun was at 22\u00b0 21\u2019 31\u201cAquarius.","1587":"The true opposition had therefore passed.","1588":"The distance was 1\u00b0 3\u2019 20\u201c.","1589":"The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 61\u2019 16\u201c, that of Mars 24\u2019 15\u201c, and their sum 85\u2019 31\u201c.","1590":"Now as 1\u00b0 25\u2019 31\u201c is to 24 hours, so is 1\u00b0 3\u2019 20\u201c to 17 hours 46 minutes, to which correspond about 18\u2019 of Mars\u2019s motion.","1591":"Therefore the time was January 30 at 19h 14m, and Mars\u2019s ecliptic position was 21\u00b0 36\u2019 10\u201c Leo.","1592":"For reduction, some very small quantity is subtracted, because Mars is then beyond the limit.","1593":"Therefore, the extension of the arc on the orbit from the following node is directed westward.","1594":"But because Mars was only 4 or 5 degrees from the node, the subtraction is rendered quite imperceptible.","1595":"The latitude, on the authority of the Tychonic table, was 4\u00b0 32\u2019 10\u201c north.","1596":"For the observation on January 31 at 12h gave 4\u00b0 31\u2019.","1597":"They added the remainder to the Tychonic figure, on account of diurnal parallax.","1598":"On the night following 1587 March 4, at 1h 16m past midnight, the position of Mars was found to be 26\u00b0 26\u2019 17\u201c Virgo,8 from Cor Leonis9 and Spica Virginis, with an observed latitude of 3\u00b0 38\u2019 16\u201c north.","1599":"But because Mars was elevated 37\u00bd\u00b0 above the horizon, diurnal parallax comes into the reckoning, and subtracts some small quantity from the longitude, thus making it 26\u00b0 26\u2019 Virgo, with a slightly greater latitude.","1600":"For since the sun is nearly twice as far away from earth as is Mars, Mars\u2019s parallax will consequently be nearly twice the sun\u2019s.","1601":"On the supposition that the sun\u2019s is 3\u2019, Mars\u2019s will be about 5\u2019.","1602":"Now when 9\u00b0 Sagittarius is rising, the nonagesimal10 is 55\u00b0 from the zenith.","1603":"Opposite this number in our parallactic table,11 under the column headed 5\u2019, the latitudinal parallax 4\u2019 is shown.","1604":"Therefore, the latitude observed from the center of the earth would be 3\u00b0 42\u2019 22\u201c north.","1605":"In Part V below, this will be useful to us in a more accurate examination of Mars\u2019s parallaxes, where a determination will be made of the precise inclination and of the absolutely certain distance of Mars for this position ^12.","1606":"The sun\u2019s true position was 23\u00b0 59\u2019 11\u201c Pisces.","1607":"The true opposition was therefore still to come.","1608":"The stars were 2\u00b0 26\u2019 49\u201c apart.","1609":"The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 59\u2019 35\u201c, that of Mars 24\u2019, and their sum 1\u00b0 23\u2019 35\u201c.","1610":"As this is to 24 hours, so is 2\u00b0 26\u2019 49\u201c to 1 day 18 hours 7 minutes, to which corresponds 42\u2019 7\u201c of Mars\u2019s motion.","1611":"Therefore, the time of true opposition was March 6 at 7h 23m.","1612":"Mars\u2019s position on the ecliptic was 25\u00b0 43\u2019 53\u201c Virgo.","1613":"For the reduction to the orbit, 55\u201c must be subtracted.","1614":"Therefore, on the orbit it was at 25\u00b0 43\u2019 Virgo.","1615":"The latitude was decreasing.","1616":"It was therefore somewhat less than 3\u00b0 38\u2019 N., or 3\u00b0 42\u2019 corrected for parallax.","1617":"On the night following 1589 April 15 at 12h 5m, the planet was found at 3\u00b0 58\u2019 20\u201c Scorpio,13 with latitude 1\u00b0 4\u2019 20\u201c north, decreasing.","1618":"Mars\u2019s altitude was 22\u2155\u00b0, where refraction from the table for the fixed stars was zero, and from the table for the sun, 3\u00bd\u2019.","1619":"But the parallax was about twice as great as the sun\u2019s, that is, 6 minutes at the horizon.","1620":"The degree rising was 24\u00b0 Sagittarius.","1621":"Therefore, the nonagesimal was 64\u00b0 from the zenith, giving a diurnal latitudinal parallax of 5\u2019 24\u201c.","1622":"Whether it really was that much will become apparent below, through a careful consideration of latitudes ^14.","1623":"For there, the northern latitude, free from diurnal parallax (and if there is no refraction), would come out to be 1\u00b0 9\u2019 45\u201c north.","1624":"And because the altitude of the nonagesimal is 26\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax15 at the horizon is 2\u2019 38\u201c.","1625":"But Mars is 40\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, counting from 4\u00b0 Scorpio to 24\u00b0 Virgo, which, under the column  headed 2\u2019 38\u201c shows a true longitudinal parallax of 1\u2019 42\u201c.","1626":"That hastens Mars further forward than when viewed from the center of the earth, and this is so on the assumption that it underwent no refraction.","1627":"But to me it is more probable that it undergoes the same refraction as the sun, greater, that is, than that of the fixed stars, because the opposition of the sun and Mars stirs up the air, while the fixed stars are observed when the air is as calm as possible.","1628":"Still, let there be no refraction at all, and let Mars be placed at 3\u00b0 57\u2019 Scorpio.","1629":"At that moment the sun was at 5\u00b0 36\u2019 20\u201c Taurus.","1630":"At this time, therefore, Mars was 1\u00b0 39\u2019 20\u201c past opposition to the sun.","1631":"Mars\u2019s diurnal motion, as is clear from comparison with April 13, is 22\u2019 8\u201c; the sun\u2019s, 58\u2019 10\u201c; the sum, 1\u00b0 20\u2019 18\u201c.","1632":"As this is to 24 hours, so is 1\u00b0 39\u2019 20\u201c to 1 day 5 hours 42 minutes.","1633":"Therefore, the moment of opposition was April 14 at 6h 23m PM.","1634":"Its position was 4\u00b0 24\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio, or a little past, if refraction were applied or if the previously assumed value for the diurnal parallax was too great.","1635":"For reduction to the orbit, some imperceptible quantity must be subtracted, since it is barely 12 degrees from the node.","1636":"This would be about 24 seconds, which are of no importance, and Mars would be at 4\u00b0 24\u2019 Scorpio, with latitude three minutes greater than before.","1637":"For from that position, the latitude was decreasing from the eighth of March; nor was it a maximum at opposition.","1638":"VI.","1639":"On the night following 1591 June 6 at 12h 20m, Mars was found at 27\u00b0 14\u2019 42\u201c Sagittarius,16 with latitude 3\u00b0 55\u00bd\u2019 south.","1640":"Refraction was of course provided for (from the table for the fixed stars), since it was large, in that Mars had no more than 6\u00b0 altitude on the meridian.","1641":"There was, however, no mention of parallax.","1642":"But at that time Mars was distant from the earth by half the solar distance.","1643":"Therefore, the horizontal parallax is greater than 6 minutes, on the supposition that the sun\u2019s parallax is 3\u2019.","1644":"I omit it nonetheless, partly because the refraction is supplied from the table for the sun (which, as I said, is the more probable), exceeding that which Brahe took here by 4\u00bd\u2019, which almost completely cancels out the parallax; and partly because Mars was on the meridian and near the winter solstice point, and thus had no longitudinal parallax.","1645":"Of the latitude, on the other hand, it will have to be seen below in Part IV whether it might not be a few minutes less, since the parallax projects the planet too far south.","1646":"The sun was at 24\u00b0 58\u2019 10\u201c Gemini.","1647":"The difference in position between the stars was 2\u00b0 16\u2019 10\u201c.","1648":"The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 57\u2019 8\u201c, and Mars\u2019s (for four days) was 1\u00b0 12\u2019 24\u201c, since on June 10 at 11h 50m it was at 26\u00b0 2\u2019 18\u201c Sagittarius.","1649":"For one day, therefore, 18\u2019 12\u201c.","1650":"The sum of the diurnal motions is 1\u00b0 15\u2019 20\u201c.","1651":"This corresponds to 1 day 19 hours 24 minutes, which, added to the 6th at 12h 20m (because opposition was yet to come), shows [the moment of opposition to be] the 8th at 7h 43m.","1652":"Mars\u2019s position was 26\u00b0 41\u2019 48\u201c Sagittarius, to which are added 52\u201c for reduction to the orbit, so as to make it about 26\u00b0 43\u2019 Sagittarius.","1653":"The latitude was six minutes greater than on 6 June, because, by the observations, the latitude here was increasing until the fortieth day after opposition, and increased nearly thirteen minutes between the 6th and the 10th of June.","1654":"Therefore, ignoring parallax and keeping the same refraction, it would be 4\u00b0 1\u00bd\u2019 ^17.","1655":"VII.","1656":"On 1593 August 24 at 10h 30m, the ecliptic position of Mars was found  to be 12\u00b0 38\u2019 Pisces,18 with latitude 6\u00b0 5\u2019 30\u201c south.","1657":"The altitude was great enough that horizontal variations canceled one another.","1658":"On the August 29th following, at 10h 20m, Mars was observed at 11\u00b0 15\u2019 24\u201c Pisces, with latitude 5\u00b0 52\u2019 15\u201c south.","1659":"It was decreasing precipitously.","1660":"For before August 10 it was maximum, fourteen days before opposition.","1661":"The motion for the five days was 1\u00b0 22\u2019 36\u201c, and for one day, 16\u2019 31\u201c.","1662":"The sun\u2019s position on August 24 at 10\u00bdh was 11\u00b0 2\u2019 31\u201c Virgo.","1663":"The stars were 1\u00b0 35\u2019 30\u201c apart.","1664":"The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 58\u2019 20\u201c.","1665":"The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 14\u2019 51\u201c.","1666":"This requires 1 day 6 hours 57 min.","1667":"until opposition, so that this will be August 26 at 5h 27m in the morning.","1668":"Mars\u2019s position was 12\u00b0 16\u2019 Pisces.","1669":"Its latitude was 6\u00b0 2\u2019 south, approximately, if the horizontal variations do indeed cancel.","1670":"VIII.","1671":"On 1595 October 30 at 8h

40m, using two quadrants, to be 50\u00b0 19\u2019, while the tail of Leo26 was 56\u00b0 45\u2019.","1718":"Therefore, from the declinations and right ascensions of the fixed stars and our distances, Mars\u2019s position is determined as 13\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c Virgo, latitude 4\u00b0 7\u2019 55\u201c ^27.","1719":"This is the Tychonic procedure.","1720":"I have included the other for the sake of showing a consensus, and also that it might be evident that despite the lack of absolute perfection in the demonstration, short cuts either in computation or in our understanding can under certain circumstances be applied.","1721":"For in that previous procedure there is less in the actual work than in the reporting of it.","1722":"At Prague, 5\u00b0 Scorpio was rising ^28.","1723":"Therefore, the nonagesimal was about 32\u00bd\u00b0 from the zenith.","1724":"And since Mars\u2019s distance from the earth was rather more than half the sun\u2019s distance, the resulting parallax of about 5\u2019 opposite 32\u00bd\u00b0 in our parallactic table, shows a latitudinal parallax of 2\u2019 41\u201c.","1725":"Thus the latitude as seen from the middle of the earth would be 4\u00b0 10\u2154\u2019 north.","1726":"And because the altitude of the nonagesimal was 57\u00bd\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax at the horizon was 4\u2019 13\u201c.","1727":"But since Mars was 38\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, the longitudinal parallax corresponding to this position is 2\u2019 36\u201c, and if this be eliminated, Mars would be placed at about 13\u00b0 18\u2019 Virgo ^29.","1728":"At that moment, the sun\u2019s position was 10\u00b0 16\u2019 42\u201c Pisces.","1729":"The distance between the bodies was 3\u00b0 1\u2019 18\u201c.","1730":"The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 4\u201c, and that of Mars, 24\u2019 5\u201c (for it was 24\u2019 18\u201c at 21\u00b0 Leo in 1585, and 24\u2019 at 26 Virgo in 1587).","1731":"The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 24\u2019 9\u201c.","1732":"The true opposition therefore followed 2 days 3 hours 43 minutes later, on 21 February\/3 March before dawn at 2h 13m, Mars being at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 35\u201c Virgo.","1733":"Forty seconds must be subtracted to reduce the position to the orbit, putting Mars at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 Virgo, with slightly less latitude than before, since the latitude was then decreasing.","1734":"It was therefore about 4\u00b0 10\u2019, or 4\u00b0 7\u2153\u2019 if the parallax be neglected.","1735":"But because, since Tycho\u2019s death, we have not made frequent observations nor continued them over several days, it would be best, for certainty\u2019s sake, also to make use of those observations which David Fabricius of East Frisia, a sedulous practitioner of astronomy, has communicated to me.","1736":"On February 16, old style, at 5h in the morning, he took the planet\u2019s distances from the tail of Leo (for the latitude), from the neck of Leo,30 and, on the other hand, from the bright star in the southern wing of Virgo, so as to check its longitude by working it out twice.","1737":"I could make use of Tycho\u2019s line of reasoning, which he routinely adopted in volume I of the Progymnasmata when (as here) the declination of the planet was not known.","1738":"But because that method extends to ten operations, I prefer for the sake of brevity to proceed as I did before with my own observations.","1739":"Here there are no hidden dangers.","1740":"First, the star in the wing of Virgo, adjusted to our time, is at 4\u00b0 36\u2019 30\u201c Libra with latitude 2\u00b0 50\u2019 north.","1741":"Fabricius found that Mars is 20\u00b0 18\u2019 westward from it on the zodiac, which puts Mars at about 14\u00b0 18\u2019 30\u201c Virgo.","1742":"This is a preliminary, approximate figure: the longitude will shortly be corrected.","1743":"Now the tail of Leo31 is at 16\u00b0 4\u2019 Virgo, with latitude 12\u00b0 18\u2019 North, and Mars was found to be 8\u00b0 17\u2019 distant from the Tail.","1744":"What is sought is the distance of its parallel from the Tail, since the difference in longitude is 1\u00b0 45\u2019.","1745":"Dividing the secant of 8\u00b0 17\u2019 by the secant of 1\u00b0 45\u2019 gives the secant of 8\u00b0 6\u2019, the arc sought.","1746":"This subtracted from the fixed star\u2019s northern latitude of 12\u00b0 18\u2019 leaves Mars\u2019s latitude, 4\u00b0 12\u2019 north.","1747":"This I now take as determined, and compare it with the latitudes of the fixed stars according to the laws of trigonometry.","1748":"From the Wing of Virgo, I find Mars\u2019s longitude to be 14\u00b0 19\u2019 Virgo; from the Neck of Leo, 14\u00b0 23\u2019 36\u201c.","1749":"The mean of these two is 14\u00b0 21\u2019 18\u201c Virgo.","1750":"And since the sextant gave distances larger than the truth, the latitude would come out at 4\u00b0 14\u2019 north.","1751":"On the night following February 23, at 12h, he observed Mars in relation to five fixed stars: the Tail of Leo and Arcturus for latitude, and for the longitude, in the first instance, Spica (which followed it), and, in the second, the Neck of Leo and Cor Leonis (which preceded it).","1752":"By a rough estimate, I foresee that Mars is going to fall at 11\u00bc\u00b0 Virgo.","1753":"It was found to be 9\u00b0 24\u2019 from the Tail of Leo, and hence, its latitude comes out at 4\u00b0 6\u2019 ^32.","1754":"And now, through this and the latitudes of the fixed stars, together with their distances (17\u00b0 26\u2019 from Regulus, 17\u00b0 51\u2019 from the Neck of Leo, 37\u00b0 28\u2019 from Spica, 44\u00b0 15\u2019 from Arcturus), Mars\u2019s position comes out at 11\u00b0 21\u2019 23\u201c Virgo (from Regulus), 11\u00b0 20\u2019 52\u201c Virgo (from the Neck of Leo), and 11\u00b0 17\u2019 40\u201c (from Spica).","1755":"Again (as you see) the distances err in being too great.","1756":"For from the Heart and the Neck [of Leo], Mars is pushed a little eastward, and from Spica and Arcturus a little westward, and more from Arcturus, owing to its greater northern latitude ^33.","1757":"The mean (ignoring Arcturus), 11\u00b0 19\u2019 20\u201c Virgo, is very nearly true.","1758":"Also, the latitude is greater, namely, 4\u00b0 7\u2019 40\u201c north.","1759":"Now from February 15 at 17h to 23 February at 12h, a period of 7 days 19 hours, Mars moved 3\u00b0 0\u2019: 180 minutes in 187 hours.","1760":"That is, about one minute per hour.","1761":"And if you wish to take it into account, the parallax (if any) is subtracted from the longitude on February 16 and a little is added on February 23.","1762":"Because the last observation follows the time of observation found by me by 2 days 21 hours 47 min., add the motion corresponding to this time, 1\u00b0 7\u2019: the position will come out 12\u00b0 26\u2019 Virgo.","1763":"The agreement is thus very good\u2014it could not be better\u2014given that both of us [that is, Kepler and Fabricius] work independently and do not rely on the facilities used by Tycho Brahe.","1764":"As for the latitude, on the 16th it was 4\u00b0 12\u2019, and on the 23rd it was 4\u00b0 7\u2154\u2019.","1765":"It is therefore fitting to set it at 4\u00b0 9\u2019 on the 21st, which comes between the other two dates.","1766":"Correction for parallax makes it somewhat greater.","1767":"And I, too, was putting it at a little less than 4\u00b0 10\u2154\u2019, or 4\u00b0 10\u2019.","1768":"XII.","1769":"Finally, in 1604, when I had published my previously written Ephemerides, in which on the night between March 29 and 30\/April 8 and 9 the planet was placed on a line from Arcturus to Spica, that very thing appeared.","1770":"For on the evening of April 8 it was slightly east of that line, but already on April 9 it was to the west.","1771":"At that time, with the help of Johann Schuler and using Hofmann\u2019s sextant, I found 33\u00b0 4\u2019 between Arcturus and Spica, which ought to have been 33\u00b0 1\u00bd\u2019.","1772":"Therefore, the reading was 2\u00bd\u2019 too great.","1773":"Immediately after, between Arcturus and Mars there was 29\u00b0 43\u00bd\u2019; therefore, correctly, 29\u00b0 41\u2019.","1774":"And since the latitude of Arcturus is 31\u00b0 2\u00bd\u2019 north, this left 2\u00b0 21\u00bd\u2019 as the latitude of Mars ^34.","1775":"There was then 54\u00b0 8\u00bd\u2019 between Cor Leonis and Mars, and at the same time, the same amount between Cor Leonis and Spica.","1776":"This should, however, have been 54\u00b0 2\u2019.","1777":"There were therefore 6\u00bd minutes too much, while before the excess was only 2\u00bd\u2019.","1778":"The origin of this uncertainty of four minutes could not be ascribed to the intervention of obstacles, as we were unable to eliminate it while observing.","1779":"But let us suppose that, as before, the excess was 2\u00bd\u2019, making the distance between Mars and Cor Leonis 54\u00b0 6\u2019.","1780":"The error could then be in Spica\u2019s position, possibly because Mars was mistaken for Spica, since they were close to one another.","1781":"Hence, Mars\u2019s latitude comes out to 2\u00b0 21\u00bd\u2019, longitude 18\u00b0 25\u2019 Libra.","1782":"The hour is known since, at the time of observation, the Back of Leo was culminating, whose right ascension is 163\u00b0 13\u2019.","1783":"Now the sun\u2019s position at noon is 18\u00b0 56\u2019 24\u201c Aries, whose right ascension is 17\u00b0 27\u2019 55\u201c.","1784":"Hence the difference in ascensions is 145\u00b0 45\u2019, which resolves into 9 hours 43 min.","1785":"The rising point was 22\u00bd\u00b0 Scorpio.","1786":"Therefore, the nonagesimal was 39\u00b0 from the zenith, and the distance of Mars from the earth was a little greater than half that of the sun from the earth.","1787":"So the parallax was about 5\u00bd\u2019, and its latitudinal part, 3\u2019 28\u201c.","1788":"Therefore the latitude without parallax was 2\u00b0 25\u2019 (whether this correction was rightly made, we shall consider below).","1789":"And because the altitude of the nonagesimal was 51\u00b0, and Mars\u2019s distance from the nonagesimal was 56\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax was 3\u2019 32\u201c.","1790":"Therefore, Mars would be at 18\u00b0 21\u00bd\u2019 Libra ^35.","1791":"At our chosen moment, the sun\u2019s position is 19\u00b0 20\u2019 8\u201c Aries.","1792":"The two celestial bodies are 58\u00bd\u2019 apart.","1793":"The sun\u2019s diurnal motion is 58\u2019 38\u201c, and that of Mars, 22\u2019 36\u201c.","1794":"(For in 1587 in Virgo it is 24\u2019, and in 1589 at 4\u00b0 Scorpio it is 22\u2019 8\u201c).","1795":"The sum of the diurnal motions is 1\u00b0 21\u2019 14\u201c.","1796":"From all these beginnings, it follows that the true opposition preceded the observation by 17 hours 20 min., namely, on 29 March\/8 April at 4h 23m in the morning.","1797":"Mars\u2019s position was 18\u00b0 37\u2019 50\u201c Libra.","1798":"For reduction to the orbit, subtract about 39 sec., making Mars\u2019s position 18\u00b0 37\u2019 10\u201c Libra.","1799":"The latitude was slightly greater than 2\u00b0 25\u2019, but, when parallax is ignored, it is 2\u00b0 22\u2019 north.","1800":"Now these twelve eccentric positions of Mars (so called because the  longitudes are freed from the effects of the second inequality) have been established with all possible care.","1801":"If in this prickly business something has escaped me somewhere (and it did escape sometimes for a period of as much as eighteen months: I relied upon a false foundation\u2014false, that is, for the applied observation\u2014and all that work was in vain), I am entirely at a loss to imagine what it could be.","1802":"I shall therefore set out all the positions in the following table, with the addition of the mean longitudes from Tycho.","1803":"I could have gotten these from the Prutenic tables, or from the computation upon which Ptolemy based his demonstrations and which he designed for that purpose, but this would be unnecessary.","1804":"For if the mean motion needed correction, it will be corrected later.","1805":"For the present, it will serve to measure the time intervals without any appreciable error.","1806":"36","1807":"Chapter 16","1808":"A method of finding a hypothesis to account for the first\ninequality.","1809":"Ptolemy, in Book 9 chapter 41 of the Great Work, where he is about to take up the first inequality, made by way of preface a somewhat cursory declaration of the suppositions of which he wished to make use.","1810":"It is, in summary, as follows: We see that a planet spends unequal times on opposite semicircles.","1811":"As, although from 2\u2154\u00b0 Cancer through Leo to 26\u00be\u00b0 Sagittarius is less than a semicircle, and from 26\u00b0 Sagittarius through Aquarius to Cancer is more than a semicircle, nonetheless the planet is found to spend longer on the former than on the latter, although a law of uniformity2 would require the contrary.","1812":"For from a mean longitude of 2s 23\u00b0 18\u2019 to 9s 5\u00b0 44\u2019 is 6s 12\u00b0 26\u2019, more than a  semicircle, that is, more than half of the planet\u2019s periodic time ^3.","1813":"So from 12\u00b0 16\u2019 Pisces through Leo to 12\u00b0 27\u2019 Virgo is about a semicircle and 11 minutes.","1814":"But if the mean longitude of the former position (11s 9\u00b0 55\u2019) be subtracted from the longitude of the latter (5s 14\u00b0 59\u2019), the difference is seen to be 6s 5\u00b0 5\u2019, which is 5\u00b0 5\u2019 more than half.","1815":"The planet consequently takes a proportionally shorter time from Virgo through Aquarius to Pisces.","1816":"Now if you examine adjacent positions one at a time and compare the intervening arcs with the times or with the arcs of mean longitude, you will see that the planet is slowest at one fixed point on the zodiac, and swiftest at the opposite point, and that at the intermediate points its motion gradually increases or decreases, according to its proximity to one or the other.","1817":"These things reveal first of all that the motion of a planet (however irregular it may appear) is governed according to cycles, and that the present cycle is the successive modification of motion and a return to its same state.","1818":"For if the planet moved in straight lines joined by angles (such as if it should move around a pentangle\u2014I was once engaged in such ideas), its motion would sometimes suddenly change from swifter to slower in an evident manner, according to the relationship of the lines, and this would happen not in one but in many places on the zodiac, according to the number of lines.","1819":"However, since so great an inequality still remains in the planet\u2019s motion, after the removal of the inequality that depends upon the sun, it therefore will be incapable of being either governed or demonstrated by the supposition of a simple circle (one set up at the center of observation).","1820":"This can, however, be done by composition of several circles, or the equivalent (as Ptolemy said in his preliminaries to Book 3).","1821":"The simplest ways of doing this are two: by using either an eccentric circle or a concentric with an epicycle.","1822":"Thus Ptolemy chooses an eccentric for the first inequality, for the sake of distinguishing between the two and providing an aid to comprehension, since an epicycle would be required for the second inequality.","1823":"Then, thinking over this general description, he denies that a mere eccentric suffices the planets.","1824":"For he first considered closely what would duly follow from the simultaneous revolution of an epicycle (to account for the second inequality) and an eccentric (for the first inequality), and it was then evident, by comparing observations, that the center of the epicycle approaches much nearer to the earth at apogee, and flees farther from it at perigee, than the simple eccentric that accounts for the first inequality allows.","1825":"From this discovery, by a continuous train of thought, he alights on the measure of this approach, and relates that he discovered that the center of the eccentric that carries the center of the epicycle is exactly at the midpoint between the center of observation, the earth, and the center of uniformity or of the eccentric accounting for the first inequality.","1826":"And, without a single demonstration, he nevertheless relies upon this principle for the three superior planets.","1827":"Copernicus, as he frequently did on other occasions, here too followed his master  religiously, his form of hypothesis being accommodated to this measure.","1828":"Not without reason, astronomers have wondered about this, and I among them (using Maestlin\u2019s voice), as you see in the Mysterium cosmographicum Ch.","1829":"22 p.","1830":"79.","1831":"Despite my having opined, in that passage of the said book, that Ptolemy used blind guesswork to establish this, the truth is the opposite.","1832":"For he was able to prove it with a perfectly good demonstration given a suitable  observation, as I shall demonstrate below.","1833":"One finds fault with the theorist only in that he did not transmit to posterity those observations along with the demonstration.","1834":"And so, since I thought then that this was altogether too much to assume,4 and also saw it pointedly called into question by Copernicus when he argued for a change in Mars\u2019s eccentricity on the basis of his figures which were not in accord with this bisection of the eccentricity, I envisaged a method which would lead me to a knowledge of the ratio of the two eccentricities (because, as I said, it is not indubitably 2:1).","1835":"And since Ptolemy used three acronychal5 observations and this preconceived opinion of the ratio of the eccentricities to find the position of the apogee, the correction of the mean longitude, and finally, the magnitude of the eccentricity, I saw that in order to weaken the sinews of the problem (once the axiom of the ratio of the eccentricity is taken away), it will be indeterminate and not having a single case, and thus I would need in addition the support of a fourth acronychal observation.","1836":"And so, in the year 1600, having acquired knowledge of this art, I came to Tycho, and was happy to learn that he too did not assume this ratio, but made an investigation, as his figures indicate.","1837":"For he makes the center of the (Copernican*)  eccentric distant from the center of vision by 13,680 units, while the point of equality in turn is another 3,780 of these units beyond that.","1838":"In the Ptolemaic form, this would be as if he were to make the distance of the centers of vision and of the eccentric 9,900, and the remaining distance between the center of the eccentric and the point of equality 7,560.","1839":"Now I myself could also have taken the bisection of the eccentricity as certainly established, and with better reason than Ptolemy, because in Ch.","1840":"22 of  my Mysterium I had brought forward a physical cause for the bisection.","1841":"Indeed, it was for this very reason that I had come to Tycho, that I might use his observations to inquire further into my opinions expressed in that book.","1842":"I of course did this without prejudice, and continue to do so.","1843":"And if I survive to see astronomy achieve its purity and perfection, so that a verdict can be given in the case which I have brought before her tribunal in that book, I promise the reader that I shall retract that book and, upon confirming what is seen as true, will faithfully reveal the remainder that has turned out not to be so ^6.","1844":"But back to the argument.","1845":"About center B let the eccentric FG be described, and on it, through B, the diameter of the apsides HI, taken as if immutable over any number of years.","1846":"If there be danger of error in this assumption, we are not lacking ways of taking it into account.","1847":"On this line below B let A be the observer, and above B let C be that center about which angles are made proportional to amounts of time, since (as was just said above) these are not proportional about A. Now let F, G, D, and E be four observations distributed about the circumference of the circle, so situated that the planet, stripped of the second inequality, would appear there as if  viewed from point A. For indeed, according to Ptolemy, A is the true center of vision or the center of the earth, while according to Tycho and Copernicus vision takes place along the lines FA, GA, DA, and EA, and A is the sun ^7.","1848":"But it was said above that in either way the planet is likewise shorn of its second inequality.","1849":"Now let each point be connected with each of the others, and let AF be at 25\u00b0 43\u2019 Virgo, AG at 26\u00b0 43\u2019 Sagittarius, AD at 12\u00b0 16\u2019 Pisces, and AE at 17\u00b0 31\u2154\u2019 Taurus.","1850":"Hence, the four angles about A are given: FAG is 91\u00b0 0\u2019, GAD is 75\u00b0 33\u2019, DAE is 65\u00b0 15\u2154\u2019, and EAF is 128\u00b0 11\u2153\u2019.","1851":"These must be corrected somewhat on account of the precession of the equinoxes.","1852":"For in relation to the fixed stars the planet is not so far forward at E (the last observation) as is indicated by these numbers.","1853":"Wherefore FAE is a little greater, and the others smaller by the same amount.","1854":"In the same way, by subtraction of the [mean] longitudes, the angles about C are also obtained.","1855":"Proposition.","1856":"It is now required to select values for angles FAH and FCH such that, once these are supposed, the points F, G, D, E stand on one circle, and that center B of that circle lie between the points C and A on the line CA.","1857":"The solution is not geometrical, at least if algebra is not geometrical, but proceeds by a double iteration ^8.","1858":"For algebra, too, forsakes us here, because terms communicated by strictly straight lines through straight line do not extend to angles,9 unless perchance one would wish to cram the entire theory of sines into this one operation.","1859":"But behold what we are required to do.","1860":"If we were to assume a value for the angle FAH, then since the line AF has a certain sidereal position, the other leg AH would also be assumed to have a certain sidereal position.","1861":"But let AH be the line of the apogee, or the line of the aphelion in the Copernican and Tychonic notion.","1862":"We are thus required to assume and posit that which is sought.","1863":"For it was in order to learn the position of this aphelion that we embarked upon this path.","1864":"In the same way, since the sidereal position of AH (that is, CH) was arrived at through this assumption of ours, and it passes through C the center of our equant circle (and therefore also through the starting point from which the numbering of its parts has its beginning, namely, the apsis which is conceived as being above H); and since we are also required to assume the angle FCH, the line CF therefore also will acquire its position on the circumference of the equant.","1865":"And indeed, this is the mean longitude corresponding to the observed position of the planet at F. And we were seeking to know what this mean longitude is.","1866":"Therefore, in addition to the apogee, we are assuming yet another thing among those which we were seeking.","1867":"At the same time, however, it is not unusual, whether in geometry, or arithmetic, or dialectic, to use a form of argument which leads to an impossibility, so that if something absurd is seen to follow from the assumptions, they are rejected as false; and this is carried out until the consequent removal of excesses and defects unveils the exact truth (which in the mathematical disciplines lies hidden in the middle between the two).","1868":"In the present case this comes about in the following manner.","1869":"Let the line CA be taken as the nominal standard (and thus, let it be given).","1870":"Since the angles FCH and FAH are assumed, and hence also the inclinations of the remaining lines to HCA, and AC is the common side of the four triangles CFA, CGA, CDA, CEA, whose angle are given, therefore the four lines AF, AG, AD, and AE will be given in relation to the length AC.","1871":"And since in the four new triangles FAG, GAD, DAE, and EAF, the sides are already given with the angles at A between two sides,  the individual angles at the bases of the several triangles (that is, AFG, ADG, ADE, and AFE), will not be a matter of ignorance.","1872":"But AFG and AFE are parts of the angle GFE.","1873":"And in the quadrilateral DEFG (if, indeed, it is inscribed in a circle, which is one of the hypotheses here), it is a consequence that two opposite angles (as GFE, GDE) taken together are equal to the sum of two right angles.","1874":"Therefore, when the four angles which we have just found are combined, if their sum differs from the measure of two right angles, we shall pronounce the assumptions false, whether the falsehood be in one or the other of the assumed values, or both.","1875":"Then, one angle, FCH, being kept the same, and the other, FAH, being changed,10 a return will be made to the beginning, and the sum of the four angles will once more sought.","1876":"If this sum differs more than the previous sum from two right angles, it suggests that FAH was altered in the wrong direction.","1877":"Therefore, the opposite must be done: if you had added something to it, you now would diminish it, or vice versa.","1878":"But if, on the other hand, you have come closer to the correct measure, then you will be sure that you are on the way.","1879":"And then by comparing the original discrepancy with that which still remains, you will carry on in that same proportion by increasing or decreasing the angle FAH.","1880":"But it is still not certain that this second correction will directly reconcile your four angles with the exact measure.","1881":"For the rate of increase of circular variables is not the same as that of straight ones.","1882":"Your labor will have to be repeated again and again, until your sum for the angles in question is 180\u00b0 or very nearly as much (you may safely ignore very small discrepancies).","1883":"When you have carried this out until the angles F and D (and therefore the remaining angles G and E) truly stand upon the same circumference, now, in turn, an enquiry must be made into the other matter that it is fitting to pursue, and that is, whether the center of that circle B lies between C and A on the same line.","1884":"For on this point it was said above that Ptolemy assumed it outright, and physical considerations demand that the slowest motion occur where the star is at its greatest distance from A, the sun, as at H. This can happen in no other way than if A, B, and C are on the same line.","1885":"To find this out, let the known angles GAD, DAE, be taken as one, so that the angle GAE may be known, and in GAE from this angle and sides GA, AE, let the side GE be sought.","1886":"Now in the triangle GFE the angle GFE stands upon the circumference.","1887":"Therefore, GBE, the angle at the center, is its double.","1888":"But the angle GFE was previously found through its parts GFA, AFE.","1889":"So, again, in the isosceles triangle GBE the angle GBE and the side GE are given.","1890":"Consequently, the angles at the base will not be unknown, as well as GB the radius of the circle, in proportion to AC, the eccentricity taken at the beginning.","1891":"And because BG and BGE are now had, and AG and AGE were had before, therefore, by subtracting AGE from BGE (or vice versa, as the case requires), the remainder will be AGB.","1892":"Next, in triangle AGB, AG, BG, and the included angle AGB are given.","1893":"[Hence, the other sides and angles will not be unknown, and thus the angle BAG will be given] ^11.","1894":"If this differs from CAG, which was taken at the beginning, it shows that B itself, contrary to what should happen, does falls outside the line CA.","1895":"So again we shall pronounce the assumed magnitudes of angles FCH and FAH to be false.","1896":"But if we keep FCH fixed and change FAH we fall into yet another absurdity, namely, that the positions D, E, F, G, do not fall upon  a circle (just as they did not above, before we had finally established the magnitude of FAH).","1897":"Therefore, it is obvious that FCH, too, has to be changed.","1898":"Let it be changed, then; that is, let another quantity be taken at will for the angle FCH, and keeping that constant, let the angle FAH be adjusted four, five, or six times, until once again the four angles at F and D add up to two right angles.","1899":"Then let an attempt be made at a second enquiry, using the triangles GAE, GFE, GBE, and BGA, to find BAG, in comparison with CAG as it has now most recently been established.","1900":"Here you will again see whether you have departed farther from the truth, or have in truth come closer, and according to the qualities of excess or defect and ratios of the additions you will thence return to the beginning until you find BAG equal to the value you had assumed during that trial for CAG or HAG.","1901":"When you have arrived at this point, then finally, in triangle BGA, you will assign a round number (100,000) to BG as a standard, and, in the same ratio (through the mediation of the angles), you will seek out BA the eccentricity of the eccentric and CA the eccentricity of the equant.","1902":"Whence, by subtracting BA, CB remains.","1903":"Then you will issue the pronouncement, concerning both the position of the apogee and the correction of the mean motion (which you had assumed in the final operation), that they are well established, at least as far as pertains to this form of hypothesis.","1904":"If this wearisome method has filled you with loathing, it should more properly fill you with compassion for me, as I have gone through it at least seventy times at the expense of a great deal of time, and you will cease to wonder that the fifth year has now gone by since I took up Mars,12 although the year 1603 was nearly all given over to optical investigations.","1905":"There will arise subtle geometers such as Vieta who will think it something great to show up the contrived nature13 of this method.","1906":"For in this matter, Vieta did object to Ptolemy, Copernicus, and Regiomontanus ^14.","1907":"Let them therefore go forth themselves and solve the figure geometrically, and they will be to me great Apolloes ^15.","1908":"For me it is enough to draw four or five conclusions from a single argument (which includes four observations and two hypotheses); that is, in getting from the labyrinth back to the highway, to show, instead of a geometrical light, a contrived thread,16 which nonetheless will lead you to the exit.","1909":"If this method is difficult to grasp, the subject is much more difficult to investigate with no method at all.","1910":"There now follows an example of this instruction based upon the four proposed observations.","1911":"Because of precession, all positions are reduced to [the time of] the first observation.","1912":"Here, the apparent longitude was 25\u00b0 43\u2019 Virgo, the mean longitude 6s 0\u00b0 47\u2019 40\u201c, and the annual motion of the fixed stars is 51 seconds, as Brahe has demonstrated in the Progymnasmata.","1913":"Therefore, from 1587 March 6 to 1591 June 8 is 4 years 3 months, to which corresponds a motion of precession of 3\u2019 37\u201c.","1914":"Therefore, we must set the apparent position in 1591 at 26\u00b0 39\u2019 23\u201c Sagittarius, and the mean longitude at 9s 5\u00b0 40\u2019 18\u201c.","1915":"Similarly, from 1587 March 6 to 1593 August 25 is 6 years 5\u00bd months, to which corresponds a motion of  precession of 5\u2019 30\u201c.","1916":"And so Mars is to be placed at 12\u00b0 10\u2019 30\u201c Pisces, with mean longitude 11s 9\u00b0 49\u2019 34\u201c.","1917":"Finally, from 1587 March 6 to 1595 October 31 is nearly 8 years 7 months, to which corresponds a motion of 7\u2019 18\u201c.","1918":"And so Mars is to be placed at 17\u00b0 24\u2019 22\u201c Taurus, with mean longitude 1s 7\u00b0 6\u2019 51\u201c.","1919":"Now first, we shall assume that the apogee or aphelion in 1587 is at 28\u00b0 44\u2019 0\u201c Leo, and second, we shall assume that the mean longitudes should be increased by 3\u2019 16\u201c,17 so that the mean longitudes are 6s 0\u00b0 50\u2019 56\u201c, 9s 5\u00b0 43\u2019 34\u201c, 11s 9\u00b0 52\u2019 50\u201c, and 1s 7\u00b0 10\u2019 7\u201c.","1920":"18","1921":"For the angles of the equations.","1922":"For the lines from A.","1923":"Let AC be taken as the standard, with magnitude 10,000.","1924":"Now as the [sines of the] angles of the equations are to AC, so are the [sines of the] angles at C to the lines from A.

and those at D are greater, because those lines AG and AE are longer than AD (48,052).","1929":"And since those four angles about A are equal to four right angles, the sum of their supplements consequently will also equal four right angles, because four semicircles are equal to eight right angles.","1930":"Therefore, half of the sum of the supplements is equal to two right angles, which is what we wish the sum of GFE and GDE to be.","1931":"Consequently, the angles at D ought to exceed [the halves of] their supplements by the same amount that those at F fall short of theirs.","1932":"But the tangents of the differences of the angles at the bases in this kind of triangle are found if you divide the differences of the sides by the sums of the sides, and multiply the quotient by the tangents of the halves of the supplements ^20.","1933":"Therefore, if the differences of the two angles at F together equal the sum [of the two differences] at D, angle at F plus the angle at D will equal two right angles ^21.","1934":"From this it is clear, therefore, that the sum of F and D is less than two right  angles, because the difference to be subtracted exceeds that to be added.","1935":"The amount wanting is 24\u2019 15\u201c.","1936":"Now I know from many repetitions of this task that by adding 3\u2019 20\u201c to the aphelion, the sums come together.","1937":"This I shall prove.","1938":"The angles of the equations and their sines will stay the same, as well as the tangents of the halves of the supplements of the angles at A.","1939":"Here the sums differ by no more than 1\u2019 48\u201c.","1940":"So we have now moved the apogee too far forward, and must move it back by another 12\u201c.","1941":"But not much care is needed with such a small difference.","1942":"We shall make it up \u201cfrom the equal and the good\u201c [that is, by interpolation], in order to be able to carry on with our method.","1943":"Before, when we had erred in defect by 29\u2019 15\u201c, the sum of the differences at F and D was 12\u00b0 1\u2019 44\u201c.","1944":"Now, when we have erred in excess by 1\u2019 48\u201c, this sum comes out to be 12\u00b0 19\u2019 46\u201c.","1945":"And so, since 31\u2019 will produce 18\u2019 in the sum of the differences, therefore, 1\u2158\u2019 produces about 1\u2019, so that the exact sum is 12\u00b0 18\u2019 44\u201c, whose half, 6\u00b0 9\u2019 22\u201c, is the sum at either F or D.\nFor the Triangles GFE, GBE.","1946":"Next, GE is sought, from the sides GA, AE, and the angle GAE.","1947":"As the sine of AGE is to AE, so is the sine of GAE to GE ^22.","1948":"Therefore, in GBE, as [sine] GBE is to GE, let [sine] BGE be to BE.","1949":"Therefore B is a little off the line CA on the side of G, since CAG is greater than BAG by 30' 38\".","1950":"But I know from many trials that by the addition of one half minute to the mean longitude, B is made to lie upon the line CA.","1951":"But at the same time, to keep the quadrangle on the circle, the aphelion has to be moved forward 2'.","1952":"If is worthwhile seeing this through, at the same time demonstrating the eccentricity.","1953":"So since 30\" are added to CF and its counterparts, and 2' to CH, HCF will be diminished by 1' 30\".","1954":"Therefore,","1955":"HCF is 32\u00b0 2' 6\";

motion of the nodes","2029":"Although it is not really necessary, we shall consider this subject here because it is related to the motion of the aphelia.","2030":"And because Ptolemy says in Book 13

the method developed above, is able in its calculations not only to account, in turn, for the four observations upon which it was founded, but also to comprehend all the other observations within two minutes\u2014a magnitude which this star, when in its acronychal position, always fills and even exceeds in the size of its body ^2.","2046":"This shows that if anyone were to repeat the above method, taking in turn  various sets of four observations, the same eccentricity with the same division, an identical aphelion, and very nearly the same mean motion, would always result.","2047":"I therefore proclaim that the acronychal positions displayed by this calculation are as certain as the observations made with the Tychonic sextants can be.","2048":"As I have said before, these observations are subject to some degree of uncertainty (at least two minutes), owing to Mars's small but appreciable diameter, and refraction and parallax, which are not yet known with complete certainty ^3.","2049":"Finally, you see how nothing prevented the transposition of acronychal observations from the mean to the apparent motion of the sun, so as to keep me from, not just imitating, but even surpassing, the certitude of the Tychonic calculation, which was raised as an objection against my abandoning the sun's mean motion.","2050":"4 5","2051":"Chapter 19","2052":"A refutation, using acronychal latitudes, of this hypothesis constructed according to the opinion of the authorities and confirmed by all the acronychal positions.","2053":"Who would have thought it possible?","2054":"This hypothesis, so closely in agreement with the acronychal1 observations, is nonetheless false, whether the observations be considered in relation to the sun's mean position or to its apparent position.","2055":"Ptolemy indicated this to us when he teaches that the eccentricity of the equalizing point is to be bisected by the center of the eccentric bearing the planet.","2056":"For here neither Tycho Brahe nor I have bisected the eccentricity  of the equalizing point.","2057":"Now for Copernicus* it was a matter of religion not to neglect this anywhere.","2058":"For he made very little use of observations, perhaps thinking that Ptolemy used no more than are referred to in his Great Work.","2059":"Tycho Brahe balked at this.","2060":"For in imitating Copernicus, he set up this ratio of the eccentricities, which the acronychal observations required.","2061":"But when this was gainsaid not only by the acronychal2 latitudes (for these still underwent some increase arising from the second inequality) but also, and much more forcefully, by observations of other positions with respect to the sun which are affected by the second inequality, he stopped here and turned to the lunar theory, and I meanwhile stepped in.","2062":"Now the method by which the whole theory of Mars could easily be acquitted of error, if the premises were correct, and by which it is demonstrated to be incorrect, is this.","2063":"First, through the latitudes at acronychal positions.","2064":"In the Copernican form, let the line DE be set out in the plane of Mars's eccentric, upon which let A be the sun, D the northern limit, E the southern limit, or the point nearest it.","2065":"And through A  let the straight line HL be drawn, lying in the plane of the earth's eccentric orb.","2066":"Now let AH and AD be conceived as lying in the one plane of a circle of latitude, and likewise AL and AE.","2067":"And let the earth in 1585 lie at B on line AH, and in 1593 let it be at the point C on line AL.","2068":"Now AB and AD are directed toward 21\u00b0 Leo, so that the sun A seen from B appears at 21\u00b0 Aquarius.","2069":"And on the other hand, E and C are at 12\u00b0 Pisces, so that the sun A seen from the earth C appears at 12\u00b0 Virgo.","2070":"But 12\u00b0 Virgo is nearer to the sun's apogee than is 21\u00b0 Aquarius.","2071":"Therefore, BA is shorter than AC.","2072":"I shall take these lines from vol.","2073":"I p.","2074":"98 of Tycho Brahe's Progymnasmata 3 and shall suppose them to be correct, although below (by a method developed for the purpose) I am going to be showing them to be slightly different ^4.","2075":"In Tycho BA is shown as 97,500, and AC as 101,400, while in the correction which is to follow, BA turns out a little longer and AC a little shorter; they are not equal, however.","2076":"Now because in Ch.","2077":"13 above, through two procedures independent of the present enquiry, the angle BAD was found to be about 1\u00b0 50' at the limit (about 16\u00b0 Leo), therefore, at four or five degrees from the limit it will be 1\u00b0 49\u00bd\u00b0.","2078":"But HBD, the apparent latitude in 1585, was 4\u00b0 32' 10\".","2079":"Hence, given the angles HBD and BAD, their difference BDA of 2\u00b0 42' 40\" is also given.","2080":"Now as the sine of BDA is to the known length BA, so is the sine of DBA to DA.","2081":"So that if BA is taken to be 97,500, DA comes out to be 163,000.","2082":"But if BA is 100,000, DA will be 167,200.","2083":"Likewise, since in 1593 C and E are in Pisces, and Mars is 26\u00b0 from its limit, 64\u00b0 from the node, consequently, the whole sine is to the sine of the maximum inclination 1\u00b0 50' as the sine of 64\u00b0 is to the sine of CAE, the inclination at this position.","2084":"CAE is therefore 1\u00b0 39'.","2085":"But the apparent latitude LCE was 6\u00b0 3'.","2086":"Therefore the angle AEC is 4\u00b0 24'.","2087":"And now, as before, as the sine of AEC is to the known length AC, so is the sine of ACE to AE.","2088":"So that if AC is taken to be 101,400, AE comes out to be about 139,300.","2089":"But if AC is 100,000, AE comes out to be about 137,380.","2090":"Now since 21\u00b0 Leo is about 8\u00b0 from the aphelion, the line AD will be about 150 parts longer at aphelion (as will be clear to anyone who computes the distances from the hypothesis we have found and substitutes these numbers); that is, either 163,150 or 167,350.","2091":"And since 12\u00b0 Pisces is about 13\u00b0 from the perihelion, AE when right at the perihelion will be about 300 parts shorter; that is, either 139,000 or 137,080.","2092":"So we have the lengths of the lines AD and AE when right at the apsides, when they are parts of the same straight line DE.","2093":"So let them be added:","2094":"Let these numbers be substituted for the original ones, where the radius of the eccentric was 100,000.","2095":"Thus, as 151,075 is to 100,000, so is 12,075 to 8000,\nand as 152,215 is to 100,000, so is 15,135 to 9943.","2096":"Therefore, the exact eccentricity of the eccentric, as indicated by the acronychal latitudes, is somewhere between 8000 and 9943, where the radius of the eccentric orb is 100,000.","2097":"But our hypothesis based upon the acronychal observations of longitude resulted in an eccentricity of the eccentric of 11,332, far different from that which is near the mean between 8000 and 9943.","2098":"Therefore, something among those things we had assumed must be false.","2099":"But what was assumed was: that the orbit upon which the planet moves is a perfect circle; and that there exists some unique point on the line of apsides at a fixed and constant distance from the center of the eccentric about which point Mars describes equal angles in equal times.","2100":"Therefore, of these, one or the other or perhaps both are false, for the observations used are not false.","2101":"The same demonstration also holds against that hypothesis established by observations adjusted to opposition to the sun's mean position, because the latitudes remain about the same over the time interval between the two moments.","2102":"Thus they show an eccentricity of the eccentric of 9943, while in Ch.","2103":"5 above, 12,600 was taken from the Brahean revision, and 12,352 in the Ptolemaic equant, where the whole eccentricity of the equalizing point was 20,160 or 19,763.","2104":"For the transformation of our diagram to the Ptolemaic form, let DE be the line of apsides, A the earth, D and E the center of the epicycle at the highest and lowest apsis, and from both points D and E let straight lines be drawn toward the earth A parallel to the plane of the ecliptic BC.","2105":"On these, let DF, EG be taken as radii of the epicycle, equal to BA, AC, and let the planet be at F and G. Therefore, the inclination FDA will be equal to the inclination BAD, and the line of vision AF will be parallel to the original line BD.","2106":"Therefore, the observed latitude, HAF and HBD, is the same.","2107":"The same must be said of the congruent triangles ACE and EGA.","2108":"And thus the demonstration and the magnitudes of the corresponding lines are the same.","2109":"It will occur to the reader to question why I make the semidiameter of Mars's epicycle unequal to itself, namely, DF equal to BA, which is longer, and EG equal to CA, which is shorter.","2110":"I answer from Part I, that this happens because of the transposition of observations from opposition to the sun's mean position to opposition to the sun's apparent position.","2111":"If we should stay with the sun's mean motion\u2014and the present line of argument prevails even then\u2014DF and EG will remain equal at least up to this point.","2112":"But for this see Part I Ch.","2113":"6.","2114":"For the Brahean form, leaving one of the triangles (DBA, say) the same, so that B may be the motionless earth and A the sun in 1585, let AB be extended so that BH is equal to AC, and let H be the sun in 1593, at 12\u00b0 Virgo, and let HI be made equal and parallel to AE in the same direction, so that Mars at perigee is at I, and at apogee at D; HBA the ecliptic, BHI, BAD the inclination; IBA the latitude at perigee, and DBH at apogee.","2115":"So again the sum of DA and HI will come out the same, whose half is DK, and the eccentricity will be KA.","2116":"The only difference is this, that for Ptolemy  the plane of the epicycle, and for Tycho the plane of the eccentric, is moved from north to south and back, remaining parallel to itself, while in Copernicus both stay in the same place.","2117":"Meanwhile, consider this also.","2118":"In chapter 16 I had found the combined eccentricity to be 18,564, whose half, 9282, is just about the mean between 8000 and 9943.","2119":"And Ptolemy too, as was remarked above, had taught us that half of the eccentricity found by acronychal observations is to be assigned to the eccentricity of the eccentric.","2120":"So it was no lack of reason that so moved him, and we should not rashly reject this bisection, since the observed latitudes support it.","2121":"Now if, on the other hand, we bisect the eccentricity of 18,564 that we found, we shall indeed represent the acronychal positions near the middle longitudes on the eccentric accurately enough, but not so well the positions around the octants and towards the apsides.","2122":"Take, for example, the opposition in 1593.","2123":"From the preceding chapter, the simple anomaly was 6s 11\u00b0 3' 16\".","2124":"I multiply the sine of 11\u00b0 3' 16\", namely, 19,174, by 9282 (before, it was to be multiplied by 7232).","2125":"This gives 1780, the sine of the arc 1\u00b0 1' 12\", which is part of the equation.","2126":"When this is added to 11\u00b0 3' 16\", the sum is the semiequated anomaly, 6s 12\u00b0 4' 28\".","2127":"The supplement of this is 167\u00b0 55' 32\", whose half is 83\u00b0 57' 46\".","2128":"The tangent of this is about 945,500, which, multiplied by the perihelial distance of 90,718 and in turn divided by the aphelial distance of 109,282, gives a tangent of 784,880, whose arc is 82\u00b0 44' 20\".","2129":"This, subtracted from the 83\u00b0 57' 46\" found earlier, leaves 1\u00b0 13' 26\", which is the other part of the equation.","2130":"If this be added to the semi-equated anomaly, and the sum be added to the aphelion, it puts the planet at 12\u00b0 13' 37\" Pisces, which differs from the former hypothesis by three minutes, and is more distant from the observed position.","2131":"For it should have been 12\u00b0 16' Pisces.","2132":"This appears more clearly at 17\u00b0 Cancer in 1582.","2133":"For with the eccentricity bisected, Mars falls at 17\u00b0 4\u00be\u2019 Cancer, and this calculated value differs from ours by 7\u2154\u2019 at about 45\u00b0 from aphelion, but by about 9' from the observation.","2134":"And from this difference of eight minutes, so small as it is, the reason is clear why Ptolemy, when he made use of bisection, was satisfied with a fixed equalizing point.","2135":"For if the eccentricity of the equant, whose magnitude the very large equations in the middle longitudes fix indubitably, be bisected, you see that the very greatest error from the observations reaches 8', and this in Mars,  which has the greatest eccentricity; it is therefore less for the rest.","2136":"Now Ptolemy professes not to go below 10', or the sixth part of a degree, in his observation.","2137":"The uncertainty or (as they say) the \"latitude\" of the observations therefore exceeds the error in this Ptolemaic computation.","2138":"Since the divine benevolence has vouchsafed us Tycho Brahe, a most diligent observer, from whose observations the 8' error of this Ptolemaic computation is shown in Mars, it is fitting that we with thankful mind both acknowledge and honor this favor of God.","2139":"For it is in this that we shall carry on, to find at length the true form of the celestial motions, supported as we are by these proofs showing our suppositions to be fallacious.","2140":"In what follows, I shall myself, to the best of my ability, lead the way for others on this road.","2141":"For if I had thought I could ignore eight minutes of longitude, in bisecting the eccentricity I would already have made enough of a correction in the hypothesis found in  Ch.","2142":"16.","2143":"Now, because they could not be ignored, these eight minutes alone will have led the way to the reformation of all of astronomy, and have become the material for a great part of the present work.","2144":"Chapter 20","2145":"Refutation of the same hypothesis through observations in positions other than acronychal.","2146":"I shall now proceed to the other argument whereby the eccentricity of the eccentric as found in Chapter 161 is proven false, despite its providing true longitudinal motions.","2147":"This argument is based upon observations of Mars at positions with respect to the sun other than opposition, when the planet was observed in the region of the eccentric's apsides.","2148":"On 1600 March 5\/15 about midnight, Mars was observed at 29\u00b0 12\u00bd' Cancer with latitude 3\u00b0 23' north.","2149":"Its mean longitude, corrected by our addition,2 was 4s 29\u00b0 14' 58\", while the aphelion was at 4s 29\u00b0 2' 45\".","2150":"Therefore, the anomaly was 0s 0\u00b0 12' 13\", requiring an equation of 2', to be subtracted, according to the hypothesis of eccentric positions established above.","2151":"Therefore, Mars's eccentric position was 29\u00b0 13' Leo, and the sun's position, 25\u00b0 45' 51\" Pisces.","2152":"In the diagram, let A be the sun, B Mars, and C the earth.","2153":"By subtraction of CB (29\u00b0 12\u00bd\u2019 Cancer) from AB (29\u00b0 13' Leo) the angle CBA will be 30\u00b0 0' 30\", while by subtraction of CA (25\u00b0 45' 51\" Pisces) from CB (29\u00b0 12' 30\" Cancer), BCA will be 123\u00b0 26' 39\".","2154":"But as [sin] CBA is to CA, so is [sine] BCA to BA.","2155":"But CA, the distance of the sun from the earth, is 99,302 from Tycho's table.","2156":"(Although this is incorrect, the true value is nevertheless between this and 100,000, as we shall learn below in Ch.","2157":"30).","2158":"Therefore, AB is between 165,680 and 166,846.","2159":"At perihelion, let the observation be taken that was made on the night following 1593 July 30 at 1h 45m ^3.","2160":"Mars was found to be at 17\u00b0 39\u00bd\u2019 Pisces with latitude 6\u00b0 6\u00bc\u2019 south.","2161":"Mars's mean longitude was 10s 26\u00b0 16' 38\", aphelion 4s 28\u00b0 55' 43\", so Mars was 2\u00b0 39' 5\" from perihelion, to which corresponds an equation of 32', to be subtracted, in accordance with the above hypothesis, making Mars's eccentric","2162":"position 10s 25\u00b0 44' 30\", and the sun's apparent position 17\u00b0 3' 0\" Leo.","2163":"In the diagram let BA be extended to D, and let AD be at 25\u00b0 44' 30\" Aquarius and ED at 17\u00b0 39' 30\" Pisces.","2164":"Therefore, EDA is 21\u00b0 55' 0\".","2165":"And because ED is at 17\u00b0 39' 30\" Pisces and EA at 17\u00b0 3' Leo, AED is therefore 149\u00b0 23' 30\".","2166":"Now as [sin] EDA is to EA, so is [sine] AED to AD.","2167":"But EA, the sun's distance from the earth, is 102,689, from Tycho's table, an erroneous figure, to be sure, but it is surely greater than 100,000.","2168":"Therefore, AD is between 140,080 and 136,409.","2169":"But  since the star Mars is 2\u2154 degrees from perihelion, AD will be shorter by about 15 at the perihelion itself, that is, between 140,065 and 136,394.","2170":"Distances for both apogee and perigee must be increased, because they were computed using observations related to the ecliptic.","2171":"Thus AD and AB are lines in the plane of the ecliptic.","2172":"On which point, take this","2173":"Protheorem4 to be used frequently below","2174":"By observations of the star Mars related to the ecliptic, and by lines in the plane of the ecliptic found through those observations, to show the length of lines corresponding to them and next to them in the plane of Mars's own orbit.","2175":"Let the line BAD be set out in the plane of the ecliptic, and through A, which denotes the sun or center of the world, let the straight line LAM be so drawn in the plane of the orbit that the star be at L and M.

therefore, AB will be 168,760.","2209":"At perigee, on 1593 July 30, since (in Brahe's reckoning) Mars's [mean] longitude was 10s 26\u00b0 12' 43\" and the apogee was at 23\u00b0 34' Leo, the simple anomaly was 182\u00b0 38' 43\", which requires an equation of 35' 52\", to be added.","2210":"Therefore, Mars's eccentric position was 10s 26\u00b0 48' 35\", and the sun's mean position 18\u00b0 24' 31\" [Leo].","2211":"Therefore, in the diagram, EDA will be 20\u00b0 50' 55\", and AED will be 158\u00b0 45' 0\" ^6.","2212":"Let EA again be 100,000, although below (as has just been remarked) it will turn out to be somewhat greater.","2213":"AD is therefore 137,300.","2214":"This you shall diminish by 15 so as to fit right at perigee: let it be 137,285.","2215":"The other you shall increase by about 100, so as to fit exactly at the apogee, so it will be 168,860.","2216":"But we shall increase both (as before) because of the inclination of the planes, 82 being added at apogee and 72 at perigee.","2217":"The final values will be:  \nthe eccentricity from the point of the sun's mean motion, or (in the Ptolemaic form) on the line of apsides drawn through the center of the epicycle.","2218":"Now where BK is 100,000, KA is 10,312.","2219":"However, the Tychonic revision based upon acronychal observations and presented in Chapter 8 required BK to be greater, namely, 12,352.","2220":"It has therefore been shown that the Tychonic revision is also subject to the same incongruity, that the eccentric has one eccentricity that results from acronychal observations, and a different one that results from the others.","2221":"And meanwhile, the observations in this Tychonic rendition lead the way to bisection.","2222":"For Tycho's figure for the whole eccentricity of the equalizing point is 20,160, half of which is 10,080, or in the form of the Ptolemaic equant, 9882.","2223":"And here we have found it to be 10,312, which closely approximates half the Tychonic value.","2224":"Indeed, it will approach much nearer, decreasing to a value less than the Tychonic (that is, to a very exact 9282), when AC in the greater diagram (BI in the smaller, on the left) is diminished, and along with it AB or GI (the distance at apogee); and, in turn, when AE of the right diagram (and its equal and equivalent DF of the left) is increased, and along with it AD or HF (the distance at perigee).","2225":"For when the lesser part is increased, and the greater diminished, the difference between the two is decreased.","2226":"The blame for this discrepancy among the different ways of finding the eccentricity (I am repeating this over and over so that it will be remembered) falls entirely upon the faulty assumptions deliberately entertained by me, in common with Tycho and all who have ever devised hypotheses.","2227":"For the necessary consequence of this enquiry is that there is no single fixed point on the planet's eccentric about which the planet always sweeps out equal angles in equal times.","2228":"We would instead have to make such a point reciprocate up and down along the line of apsides\u2014if, indeed, we could keep the other assumption of a circular orbit.","2229":"And how such a reciprocation could be reconciled with natural principles, I do not see.","2230":"But in fact the other assumption will be demolished, in Ch.","2231":"44 below; that is, the orbit of the star is not a perfect circle, but an oval, and its greatest diameter is the line of apsides, while its least is that passing through the center at the middle elongations.","2232":"No wonder, then, that the other observations at points not at opposition to the sun do not accord with the hypothesis constructed in Chapter 16, since we have made two false assumptions in it.","2233":"Chapter 21","2234":"Why, and to what extent, may a false hypothesis yield the truth?","2235":"I particularly abhor that axiom of the logicians, that the true follows from the false, because people have used it to go for Copernicus's throat, while I am his disciple in the more general hypotheses concerning the system of the world.","2236":"I therefore considered it particularly worth while now to show the reader how it does happen here that the true follows from the false.","2237":"First, you have already seen that what has followed is not completely true.","2238":"For the path of the planet through the single plane of the ecliptic was considered in two ways: first, in respect to its longitude beneath certain degrees and minutes of the circle of the zodiac, and second, in respect to its altitude or distance from the center of the world about which it moves, which it shows to be different by means of other zodiacal positions.","2239":"Therefore, our false supposition, although it does put the planet in the right longitudinal position at the right time, does not give it the right altitude.","2240":"So what follows from this false hypothesis is not completely true.","2241":"Further, even concerning the longitude alone, the fact that the result appears identical to the senses does not prove that the as yet unknown true hypothesis and the false one assumed by us have an identical result.","2242":"For there can be a very small discrepancy which the senses do not perceive.","2243":"There are, however, occasions upon which a false hypothesis can simulate truth, within the limits of observational precision, with respect to the longitude.","2244":"These I shall now demonstrate.","2245":"Through the center of the world A let the straight line MP be set out, falling upon opposite parts of the zodiac (29\u00b0","2246":"Leo and Aquarius, say).","2247":"And let it so be that according to some true hypothesis the planet spends half its time between lines AM and AP on the left and the other half on the right, so that after successive halves of its periodic time it is always alternately on the lines AM and AP.","2248":"And let it be assumed that this particular effect of the true hypothesis is expressible by  some other hypothesis that has been discovered.","2249":"And so let a circle of any kind or some other curvy line be described about a center taken on the line MP, with the sole provision that it go around the center of the world A and that it be cut into two equal parts by the line MP.","2250":"What is proposed will happen if the planet traverse the circle with a uniform motion (one which is regular about any one particular point on the line MP, whether fixed or movable); as, for instance, if the circle OP were described about center A and moved uniformly about it.","2251":"So all these circles and other figures have something in common through which what was proposed occurs, namely, that they move around the center of the world, and move regularly around some point on the line MP.","2252":"Now the figure, whether this or that circle, whether one or another point of uniform motion, out of all those comprehended under the same genus, can be false.","2253":"But we have brought about what was proposed, not through this false specific model, but through that which, within this false one, was comprehended within a general truth.","2254":"Now let us continue, and let it happen that after successive quarter periods the planet lies on the lines AM, AK, AP, AL, the angles MAK, MAL, being less than right angles.","2255":"Here, then, the former circle OP will be in error at the sides.","2256":"For since the motion was supposed regular about A, a straight line drawn through A perpendicular to MP (namely, VX) will make the angles MAV, MAX measures of quarter periods.","2257":"And accordingly, this hypothesis would put the planet on the lines AV, AX, when it should have been on AK, AL.","2258":"Now experience testifies that the planets' motion closely emulates circularity (although it may perchance not exactly attain it), and it is the nature of motions of this kind to undergo gradual intensification and remission, admitting nothing sudden.","2259":"Therefore, the error of this hypothesis of the circle OP will begin little by little from the line AM, will grow continually greater, becoming a maximum at AK, and will again gradually decrease and vanish at AP.","2260":"Therefore, the uniform and concentric hypothesis OP will never be more in error than it is at AK, AL, by the angles KAV, LAX, which, for Mars, are 10\u00bd\u00b0.","2261":"So let there now be another hypothesis which, in addition, also shows us the lines AK, AL.","2262":"But again, there can be several hypotheses that do this.","2263":"For we might connect the points where AK and AL intersect the circle OP, and where this straight line intersects the straight line MP we may place the center of uniform motion of the circle OP, so that the motion of the circle OP becomes nonuniform.","2264":"We would then also have [the planet on] the lines AK, AL [at the appropriate times].","2265":"But since we have a certain inclination towards choosing the simplest and most regular, we shall therefore seek out that circle that moves uniformly about its own center while effecting for us what is proposed.","2266":"Therefore, beginning from A, mark off equal lengths AK, AL upon the lines AK, AL; let the points K and L be joined by a straight line intersecting MP at C; and about C with radius CK let the eccentric circle MN be described, whose motion shall be regular about its center.","2267":"This hypothesis will represent the planet in the correct position, on the four lines AM, AN, AK, AL.","2268":"But it is not this hypothesis alone, but many others as well, that could have this effect.","2269":"For they have this feature that is general, and is indeed perfectly true, that the point of uniform motion is on the line that connects the  positions of the planet falling upon the lines AK, AL, and at that point upon it where the line intersects MP.","2270":"Now it follows from the premises that this hypothesis has absorbed the entire maximum error of the former hypothesis OP, namely, KAV, LAX, at about the quarters of the period, nor does it commit a new error (since at AM, AP it is equivalent to the former).","2271":"Therefore, if this hypothesis is still in error, that error will be much smaller than KAV.","2272":"And since it has done its job at CM, CN, CK, CL, the error (if any) will retreat to the four regions intermediate to those just mentioned, and will occur at the eighths of the period, since the time is measured about C. Therefore, angles MCK, KCN being bisected, let two new lines be drawn through C intersecting the circumference at Q, T, R, S. The maximum error, if any, will be about these points.","2273":"But the hypothesis will also place the planet on the lines AQ, AR, AS, AT, at the eighths of the period.","2274":"Now suppose (as is true for Mars) that after the eighths of the periodic time the planet should not appear on the lines AQ, AR, AS, AT, but should instead be, for the former two, on the lines AF, AE, higher up, and for latter two on the lines AG, AD, lower down.","2275":"Therefore, if the former error KAV was 10\u00bd\u00b0, the present error QAF will hardly amount to a few minutes.","2276":"For Mars, the magnitude of QAF or RAE is observed to be about 9\u2019, while SAG or TAD is about 28'.","2277":"Now as a third step, let this hypothesis too be corrected.","2278":"As this can happen in a variety of ways (specifically, by a reciprocation of the point C along the line CA), we are not prevented by any scruple from keeping the point of uniform motion C fixed at distance CA, on account of the angle KAV, and also keeping the planet's path circular.","2279":"These three, taken by choice and not forced by demonstration, will compel us to move the center of the eccentric downwards to B from the point of uniform motion C. Hence, HI is substituted for MN, and the body of the planet departs from the points Q, R, S, T, nevertheless remaining on the lines CQ, CR, CS, CT (because the measure of time stays at C), and arrives at the points marked F, E, G, D. And QF, ER, SG, TD would be such as to make QAF, EAR 9\u2019 and SAG, TAD 28'.","2280":"With this done, that error at the eighths of the period will also be absorbed, and the hypothesis will exhibit the longitude perfectly accurately at eight places.","2281":"Thus if again some error remains, it will be at the sixteenths of the period, the points in between.","2282":"Also, since this third eccentric HI is equivalent to the first at positions AM, AP, as well as to the second at the additional positions AK, AL, it introduces no new error.","2283":"And because the error of the second was greatest at the eighths of the period, and this is now absorbed, at the sixteenths there will therefore be a much smaller error remaining from the old error.","2284":"Let us estimate it proportionally: just as the error of the first eccentric was 10\u00bd \u00b0 while that of the second was 9' or 28', that is, one seventieth or one twenty-fifth of the former, let us now make the errors of the second that many  times the errors of the third.","2285":"Plainly, already at the sixteenths of the period, we will have driven the business down to within the limits of observational accuracy.","2286":"It is at least now clear to what extent and in what manner the truth may follow from false principles: whatever is false in these hypotheses is specific to them and can be absent, while whatever endows truth with necessity is in general aspect wholly true and nothing else ^1.","2287":"Further, as these false principles are fitted only to fixed positions throughout the whole circle, so the truth does not invariably follow outside those very positions, except to the extent that happens in this procedure, that the difference can no longer be appraised by the acuteness of the senses.","2288":"Also, this same dullness of the senses hides the following additional small error which remains at the eighths of the period.","2289":"That there is such a remainder I prove thus:","2290":"Once again, let a perfect eccentric be described about B so that BD, BE, BF, BG are equal, and let us have made BC such that the angle QAF is of the required magnitude.","2291":"Now it is not likewise left to our discretion how great we want angle SAG to be, since it will be completely determined.","2292":"From A draw a perpendicular to QT, and let this be AZ.","2293":"Now, as above, let AC be 18,564 where CQ is 100,000.","2294":"And because ACZ is 45\u00b0, AZ or ZC will be 13,127 (both in the same units).","2295":"Therefore, ZQ is 113,127, and AQZ 6\u00b0 37' 5\", and QAZ 83\u00b0 22' 55\", whose tangent is 864092 ^2.","2296":"Now let FAZ be taken as 9' less: its tangent FZ will be 844900 ^3.","2297":"But where AZ is 13,127, ZF will be 110,910.","2298":"Therefore, QF will be 2217.","2299":"Now QF is larger than TD, which I prove thus: QT is the diameter of the circle, and is therefore equal to the two semidiameters FB, BD taken together.","2300":"But BF, BD taken together are greater than FD.","2301":"Therefore, QT is also greater than FD.","2302":"Let the common part FT be subtracted.","2303":"The remainder QF is then greater than TD.","2304":"And yet, over and above what is required, we shall allow them to be equal.","2305":"Let CZ, 13,127, be subtracted from CT, so as to leave ZT, 86,873.","2306":"Now from AZ, AT, ATZ is known, and it is 8\u00b0 35' 33\".","2307":"So ZAT is 81\u00b0 24' 27\".","2308":"And because ZT is 86,873, I shall add to it a magnitude equal to QF, as if it were TD, namely, 2217.","2309":"This will makes ZD 89,090.","2310":"But where AZ is 100,000, ZD will become the tangent of the angle ZAD, 686,291.","2311":"Thus this angle is 81\u00b0 42' 35\".","2312":"But ZAT was 81\u00b0 24' 27\".","2313":"Therefore TAD, or SAG, is less than the difference, 18' 8\", since TD is less than 2217.","2314":"This then is the required angle TAD, which ought to have been 27\u2157\u2019.","2315":"And so if you make QAF 12' instead of 9', TAD becomes 24'.","2316":"And in both places the planet is made to be 3 minutes higher than it should be.","2317":"The equation therefore will be seen to be too large, and thus the eccentricity [of the equant] is too large.","2318":"It will straightaway be diminished, then, so that the planet is about 1\u00bd\u2019 lower at the lines AK, AL, and the same amount (that is, 1\u00bd\u2019 ) higher at D, E, F, and G ^4.","2319":"This mutual tempering of various influences causes one error to compensate for another, brings the calculation within the limits of observational precision, and makes it impossible to perceive the falsity of this specific hypothesis.","2320":"And so this sly courtesan cannot gloat over the dragging of truth (a most chaste maiden) into her bordello.","2321":"Any honest woman following the lead of this prostitute would stay closely in her tracks owing to the narrowness of the streets and the press of the crowd, and the stupid, bleary-eyed professors of the subtleties of logic, who cannot tell a candid appearance from a shameless one,  judge her to be the prostitute's maidservant.","2322":"This is without doubt the reason for the remaining discrepancies of one or two minutes in Ch.","2323":"18, in Cancer, Leo, Scorpio, and several other places.","2324":"But the error is not easy to see, since the observations used do not fall at the apsides and at the quarters and eighths of the period.","2325":"Conclusion of Part II","2326":"Up to the present, the hypothesis accounting for the first inequality (in which Brahe and Copernicus are in agreement, both differing somewhat in form from Ptolemy) has been presented using the sun's mean motion, which all three authors had substituted for the sun's apparent motion.","2327":"Thereafter, it was shown that whether we follow the sun's apparent motion and the hypothesis found in Ch.","2328":"16, or the sun's mean motion and the hypothesis proposed in Ch.","2329":"8 according to Brahe's revision, in both instances there result false distances of the planet from the center, whether of the sun (for Copernicus and Brahe) or of the world (for Ptolemy).","2330":"Consequently, what we had previously constructed from the Brahean observations we have later in turn destroyed using other observations of his.","2331":"This was the necessary consequence of our having followed (in imitation of previous theorists) several things that were plausible but really false.","2332":"And this much of the work is dedicated to this imitation of previous theorists, with which I am concluding this second part of the Commentaries."},"Entities":{"809":[],"810":[["Mars","PLAN"]],"811":[],"812":[],"813":[],"814":[],"815":[["inclination","ASTR"]],"816":[],"817":[],"818":[],"819":[],"820":[],"821":[["Maestlin","NAME"],["Rheticus","NAME"]],"822":[["Maestlin","NAME"]],"823":[],"824":[],"825":[],"826":[],"827":[["Tycho
