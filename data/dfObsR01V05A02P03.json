And since \u03b2\u03b8\u03b7 is 68\u00b0 26' 44\", while before, when \u03b8\u03b7 was being found, \u03b1\u03b8\u03b7 was 69\u00b0 18' 46\", \u03b2\u03b8\u03b1 is therefore 0\u00b0 52' 2\". Next, in the triangle \u03b2\u03b8\u03b1, from the sides and the included angle, \u03b8\u03b1\u03b2 and \u03b1\u03b2 are sought. And the angle \u03b8\u03b1\u03b2 is found to be 97\u00b0 50' 30\", so that \u03b1\u03b2 is at 15\u00b0 8' 30\" Gemini, because \u03b1\u03b8 is at 22\u00b0 59' Virgo. Tycho, however, places the sun's apogee at 5\u00bd\u00b0 Cancer. So you see that this very free enquiry has brought us within 20\u00b0 of the correct Tychonic position. Also, \u03b1\u03b2 is found to be 1023, and if \u03b8\u03b2 be taken as 100,000, \u03b1\u03b2 will become 1530. But the whole solar eccentricity is 3592, and its half is 1796 or 1800. So here somewhat less than half of the solar eccentricity is claimed for the eccentricity of our circle. But you should bear in mind that observations near minimum values may be somewhat in error, and that use was made of a questionable mean longitude and equation from Tycho. This will become quite clear if you will carry out the same operation with the angle \u03b8\u03b7\u03b6, and then with \u03b7\u03b5\u03b6 and \u03b8\u03b5\u03b6. For each time, \u03b1\u03b2 has a somewhat different magnitude, and its position beneath the fixed stars will fall one side or the other of 5\u00bd\u00b0 Capricorn and Cancer.","245":" Consequently, we shall look into this more carefully below, where in many instances, through a fine demonstration, the eccentricity will be found to be half the solar eccentricity, and the apogee very near the Tychonic one.","246":"It has thus been demonstrated in the Copernican form that the center of the earth's circuit is halfway between the sun's body and the point of uniform motion of that circuit.

And so, since this Ptolemaic epicycle and this Brahean deferent have so great an analogy with the theory of the sun, it is likely that they also have a greater analogy: that is, the sun's true eccentricity, too, will only be half of that computed from the maximum equation; or, what is the same thing, the sun will make use of an equant, whose eccentricity is twice the eccentric's eccentricity.","251":"Finally, in the Tychonic form it has been demonstrated that the point whence originate the planets' eccentricities does not move on the sun's concentric, but throughout its course is unequally distant from the earth, about which it moves regularly and uniformly; and that it is farther away near the sun's perigee, and nearer at apogee, again by half of the sun's eccentricity.

With \u03b1\u03b8 accordingly moved forward, if these lines of sight \u03b7\u03b8, \u03b6\u03b8, and the rest were to stay the same, it would come about that \u03b1\u03b8 would be intersected by \u03b7\u03b8 at a place higher than \u03b8; and on the other hand it would be intersected by \u03b6\u03b8 and its counterparts at a place lower than \u03b8. 7 So \u03b1\u03b8 would not keep the same length.

","366":" That these characteristics belong to the Ptolemaic epicycle, is properly demonstrated. But that they are carried over from the epicycle to the theory of the sun is shown by a probable argument only, pieced together from Ptolemaic opinions. For, keeping everything as it was, let \u03b1\u03c4 be set up equal to \u03b1\u03c0 and in the same line but in the opposite direction, so that \u03c4\u03b1 may be the center of the sun's uniform motion, which the theorists had thought to be the center of the sun's orbit. Therefore, the line \u03b8\u03bd\u03bf will always be parallel to the line of the sun's apogee \u03b1\u03c4.

And in this matter, he, along with Ptolemy and Copernicus, was strongly urged by me (in Ch. 6 of Part I) to seek that point of attachment, whether it is the center of the concentric or of an eccentric, in the center of the solar body, this being supported by physical arguments and by the demonstration of its geometrical possibility. Additional support is provided by the valid argument of Ch. 22 and 23, that unless this were done, even if the observations were referred to the sun's mean position, the Ptolemaic epicycle and the Brahean deferent would be made eccentric, in directions exactly opposite to the sun's eccentricity. I have also promised stronger arguments, deduced from Brahe's own observations, for abandoning the sun's concentric, and in Ch. 52 and 57 below I will produce them ^12.

I have also promised stronger arguments, deduced from Brahe's own observations, for abandoning the sun's concentric, and in Ch. 52 and 57 below I will produce them ^12. But it has already been proved here in Chapter 26 that this center of Mars's concentric (or the point from which Mars's eccentricity originates) is found, not on an equal eccentric described about the center of the sun's point of uniform motion \u03c4, as Brahe along with the other authorities had believed, but on an eccentric described about \u03be, which is in the middle position between \u03b1 and \u03c4.\nTherefore, if the center of Mars's concentric goes around with the sun, it nevertheless goes around on an eccentric described about \u03be, and consequently the sun itself will go around on an eccentric described about \u03be. But its motion is uniform about \u03c4. Therefore, the sun's eccentricity \u03b1\u03c4 must be bisected at \u03be. For it is not likely that, although the centers of the concentrics of Mars and the sun go around in the same way, reach apogee at the same time, transpose their apogees in the same way, go slowly or quickly in the same way, and describe the same circumferences, their circles would nevertheless make different digressions from the earth in the same direction.\nLet it be enough for now, to present this form of demonstration in the three hypotheses. In what follows, whenever there is need of the same demonstration, I shall use Copernicus's form alone, it being simpler, so as not to be too long-winded. Now, in contrast, the industrious reader has seen how any of  these diagrams can be transformed into either the Ptolemaic or the Copernican form using parallel lines.

For \u03c0\u03b2\u03c3 is greater than \u03b6\u03b2\u03b1, which \u03b6\u03b1 subtends. So Ptolemy, and after him Reinhold in the Theoricae, demonstrated correctly that the greatest equation (eccentric equation alone, or optical part) occurs at \u03b6 ^8. I shall, however, set up this demonstration in another, simpler form. Let any point be taken above \u03b6, such as \u03b8, and any below \u03b7 or \u03b6, such as \u03b9. Let them be connected with \u03b1, and from \u03b2 let perpendiculars \u03b2\u03ba fall to \u03b8\u03b1 or \u03b9\u03b1 extended. Now since \u03b4\u03b1\u03b6 and \u03b2\u03ba\u03b1 are equal, they being right angles, and \u03ba\u03b2\u03b1, \u03ba\u03b1\u03b2 together are equal to one right angle, when the same angle \u03b4\u03b1\u03b8 or \u03b2\u03b1\u03ba is subtracted from the equals, the equals \u03b8\u03b1\u03b6, \u03ba\u03b2\u03b1 will remain. And first, let a line be drawn through \u03b1 above \u03b6, as \u03b8\u03b1 was just drawn, whether \u03b8 is next to \u03b6 or remote. At the same time let its perpendicular \u03b2\u03ba be inclined to \u03b2\u03b1. Now \u03b2\u03b1 is greater than any of the perpendiculars \u03b2\u03ba, since \u03b2\u03b1 is subtended by the right angle \u03b2\u03ba\u03b1, while \u03b2\u03ba is subtended by the smaller, acute angle \u03b2\u03b1\u03ba. Now since \u03b2\u03b6, \u03b2\u03b8, \u03b2\u03b9 are equal, and \u03b2\u03b1\u03b6, \u03b2\u03ba\u03b8, \u03b2\u03ba\u03b9 are right, they fit onto the same semicircle, whose diameter is equal to \u03b2\u03b6, \u03b2\u03b8, \u03b2\u03b9. And \u03b2\u03b1, being longer, subtends a greater part of the circumference of any such semicircle than does \u03b2\u03ba or any of the perpendiculars; and for that reason, its angle \u03b2\u03b6\u03b1 will be greater than \u03b2\u03b8\u03ba, or the angle of the equation for any other point above \u03b6, such as \u03c0 or \u03be.

For Saturn takes 30 years, Jupiter 12, Mars 23 months, earth 12, Venus 8\u00bd, and Mercury 3. Nevertheless, it follows from what has been said that every orb of power emanating from the sun (in the space embraced by the lowest, Mercury, as well as that embraced by the highest, Saturn) is twisted around with a whirl equal to that which spins the solar body, with an equal period. (There is nothing absurd in this statement, for the emanating power is immaterial, and by its own nature would be capable of infinite speed if it were possible to impress a motion upon it from elsewhere, for then it could be impeded neither by weight, which it lacks, nor by the obstruction of the corporeal medium.)

My answer is that it is to some extent from the sun, and to some extent not from the sun.","975":"Examples of natural things, and this hitherto disparaged kinship of  celestial things for terrestrial ones, cry out that in a simple body the operations which are more general are simpler, while the variables, if any (such as, in the motion of the planets, the varying distance from the sun, or the eccentricity), arise from the concurrence of extrinsic causes.","976":"Thus, in a river, the simple property of water is to descend towards the  centre of the earth.

Hence, the small area between the two conchoids AQRBSLA and AAAAAA is the measure of the excesses of the distances from A over the distances from B \u2014and the standard of measure is the same as that by which the parallelogram is set equal to all the distances from B.

raised an objection against myself at the end of the chapter: if the cause I proposed were true, it ought to hold universally for all planets ^1.","10":"But since the earth, one of the celestial bodies (for Copernicus), or the sun (for the rest) had not hitherto required this equant, I decided to leave that speculation open, until the matter were clearer to astronomers.","11":"I nevertheless entertained a suspicion that this theory might perchance also have its equant.","12":"After I gained the recognition of Tycho, this suspicion was confirmed in me.","13":"For in a letter to me in Styria in 1598 Brahe said the following:","14":"The annual orb according to Copernicus, or the epicycle according to Ptolemy, does not appear always of the same size, in comparisons made to the eccentric, but introduces a perceptible alteration in all three superior planets, so much so that for Mars the angle of difference reaches one degree 45' ^2.","15":"He also touched upon this point at the same time in the appendix to his Mechanica,3 an account of his studies.","16":"Also, his words in volume I p.","17":"209 of his letters4 are not much different, where he states the opinion that as an effect of the solar eccentricity a certain amount of nonuniformity is also mixed in with the eccentric equations and the acronychal positions.","18":"This is, in fact, refuted in Part I: it is not reflected in the acronychal positions, or at least very little.","19":"But it appears that this needs to be understood through a certain correction regarding Mars at 90\u00b0 from the sun.","20":"Now when I heard that the annual orb grows and shrinks, an inspiration said to me that this illusion arises thus: Copernicus's annual orb, or Ptolemy's epicycle, is not everywhere distant from that center about which by supposition it is sweeping out equal angles in equal times.","21":"For what physical cause  could make the circuit of the center of the planetary system (Tychonic) or of the circuit of the earth (for Copernicus) or of the epicycle bearing the star (for Ptolemy) grow and shrink?","22":"What, I ask, is this novelty unprecedented in astronomy, this unlikely absurdity?","23":"Wouldn't it seem more worthy of belief that the sun (for Copernicus) or the center of the planetary system (Tychonic) or the body of the planet (for Ptolemy) would in certain places be farther from, and in others nearer to, the selected point of uniform motion (at rest for Copernicus and Tycho, and moving around on the circumference of the eccentric for Ptolemy)\u2014and this especially on the line of apsides?","24":"And for this, that suspicion of mine arising from my Mysterium cosmographicum\u2014that an equant might be introduced into the theory of the sun (or, as I call it, the theory of the Ptolemaic epicycle)\u2014seemed to provide a convenient occasion.","25":"Let us suppose that the second inequality starts from the line of the sun's mean motion, as the practitioners have hitherto been pleased to hold (lest anyone hold suspect here my innovation of using the sun's apparent motion), and in the present diagram let the planet's eccentricity for Copernicus originate not from the sun's center A, but from the point C about which the earth's motion is supposed regular.","26":"But let that point C not be the center of the earth's orb DE but only of uniformity of motion, and let its distance from the sun A be greater than that of B, the center of the earth's orb ED.","27":"I say that, these things being granted, such observations will be produced from which one might suspect the annual orb of growing and shrinking.","28":"Let a line CF be drawn from C perpendicular to DE, and let the star Mars be at F twice: once when the earth is at D and again when it is at E; and let F be joined with the points D and E. Now because C is the point of uniformity of the earth's motion on DE, FCD and FCE will be the anomaly of commutation, and (as we suppose) equal on both sides.","29":"Now if CD and CE were equal (as has hitherto been thought) then the angles DFC and EFC, parallaxes of the orb, would be equal on both sides, for both anomalies of commutation.","30":"But because CE is greater than CD, the angle CFE will also appear greater than the angle CFD.","31":"Therefore, anyone not noticing that this growth occurs only at or about E, and that the contrary diminution occurs only at the contrary position D, will think that the entire annual orb sometimes gets larger, with radius CE, and sometimes smaller, with radius CD.","32":"This is because such a person presupposes, along with astronomy as it has hitherto been practiced, that the point of equal motion C is at the same time also the center of the circle DE.","33":"In the Ptolemaic form, let the earth be at C, and the lines of the sun's mean motion be CK, CL, in place of DC and EC in the preceding Copernican arrangement.","34":"And let the center about which the epicyclic motion is regular be at F, and IH be equal and parallel to ED so that, CI being drawn, it is parallel to DF and CH to  EF.","35":"For when the earth (or the observer) is transferred to the center of the world C, as Ptolemy has it, Mars at F is likewise transferred to H. Similarly, owing to the translation of D to C, F is transferred to I. Now Ptolemy, thinking that the point F, about which the motion of the epicycle IH is uniform, is also the center of the epicycle IH, supposed FI and FH to be exactly equal.","36":"Consequently, for both of the equated anomalies HFC as well as IFC (that is, at both 90\u00b0 and 270\u00b0, in this diagram) he posited one and the same equation of the epicycle, namely, the equal angles HCF and ICF.","37":"So if observation affirms that HCF is greater than ICF, then the center of the epicycle will not be at the point of uniform motion F, but at G, in the direction of H. Further, on the supposition that F be nevertheless considered the center of the epicycle, the epicycle will appear distinctly enlarged at anomaly 90\u00b0 at H, and diminished at 270\u00b0 at I, while in both instances Mars, in its eccentric position (that is, on the line CF), is in the same position with respect to the fixed stars.","38":"In the Tychonic form, let C remain the earth, DE the sun's circle with center B, but let the center of uniform motion be A. And let the lines along which the planet is seen (namely, CI and CH) be the same as in Ptolemy.","39":"Accordingly, let HL, IK descend from H and I parallel to FC.","40":"In order that K and L be the center of the planetary system, let the center of its circuit be M, which is in the direction of the sun's perigee, so that the point M, the center of the circuit KL (in which is found the point from which Mars's eccentricity originates) descends as far below C as the point B, the true center of the sun's circuit (contrary to common opinion), descends below A, the putative center of the same circuit of the sun.","41":"And let AC and BM be equal.","42":"The line of equated motion on the eccentric (that is, KI, LH) will be parallel to itself after an integral number of returns of the planet.","43":"Therefore Tycho, thinking that the earth C is in the middle of the circuit KL bearing the planets' eccentrics, will make angles CIK, CHL equal when the angles of commutation CLH, CKI are equal.","44":"But if these are perceived to be unequal, CHL being the greater, CL will be longer than CK: and the orb KL, the deferent of the center of the system, will appear to grow at L and to shrink at K, because M, the center of the orb which is the planetary system's deferent, is not believed to be elsewhere than at the earth C, about whose center the motion of that orb is uniform.","45":"Now what greatly contributes to obscuring the true cause of this difference, namely, to freeing the sun's eccentricity from suspicion, is the fact that thereby*  the distance CK of the center of the system from the earth becomes short just where the distance CE of the sun from the earth becomes long; and conversely, that the former, CL, becomes long where the latter, CD, becomes short.","46":"The reason why the apsides have thus been reversed is this.","47":"For Copernicus, the earth traverses the regions opposite the Tychonic sun and the Ptolemaic epicycle, and also DC, CE, the distances of the earth from the sun, of the sun from the earth, and of Mars H or I from the epicycle's center of uniform motion F, subtend angles of the same magnitude in all three forms of hypothesis.","48":"Therefore, it also happens that the Copernican distances of the sun and the earth will be transferred to the opposite sides by Brahe and Ptolemy; that is, CE to CL or FH, and CD to CK or FI.","49":"Next, in order either to confirm or undermine this speculation by observations, this is the road upon which I  set out.","50":"Since the sun's apogee is at 5\u00bd\u00b0 Cancer, I enquired whether there might exist an observation in which Mars, reckoned by the first inequality, would be twice at 5\u00bd\u00b0 Libra or Aries, while the sun would be at 5\u00bd\u00b0 Cancer at one time, and then at 5\u00bd\u00b0 Capricorn.","51":"As it turns out, this is not possible within such a short space of time (20 or 30 years).","52":"For the periodic motions of Mars and the sun are incommensurable, nor do they ever coincide at 90\u00b0 from one another, or at opposition, after a certain number of complete periods, or quarter or half periods, of either.","53":"I therefore had to choose the next best thing, which was to find many days throughout those 20 years on which the planet was observed, and in which the equated anomaly of commutation was 90\u00b0 or 270\u00b0 or nearly that much, with Mars at 6 Aries or Libra or thereabouts.","54":"Afterwards, it was necessary to look up all those dates in the catalog of observations of Mars, so I could see whether it had been observed at those moments.","55":"Had the indefatigable Tycho Brahe not observed Mars very frequently, the selection would have been so exclusive that I would not have been able to accomplish what I wished.","56":"Now since Tycho put the apogee of Mars at 23\u00bd\u00b0 Leo, while the required position of Mars, corrected by the eccentric equation, was 5\u00bd\u00b0 Libra, an equated anomaly of 42\u00b0 was required.","57":"And from his table, to an equated anomaly of 42\u00b0 there corresponds an equation of 8\u00b0 15\u2157'; therefore, a mean anomaly on the eccentric of 50\u00b0 16' was required, and through this I was shown twelve points in time in the twenty years between 1579 and 1600.","58":"Thus, what had to be skillfully tracked down is whether for any of these times there was an equated anomaly of commutation that was at one time 90\u00b0 and again 270\u00b0, or if the former were greater or less, the latter would be correspondingly less or greater.","59":"One revolution of Mars has 687 days, and two of the sun have 730\u00bd.","60":"The difference is 43\u00bd days, to which corresponds 42\u00b0 54' 23\" of the sun's mean motion.","61":"This, therefore, is how much the anomaly of commutation changes at the end of any revolution of Mars.","62":"Therefore, when in any two year period one seeks two anomalies of commutation that are equal, with Mars at the same eccentric position, each angle of commutation should be 21\u00b0 27'.","63":"Over four years 42\u00b0 54' is required; over six years, 64\u00b0 22'; over eight years, 85\u00b0 49'.","64":"And we were supposing 90\u00b0, if it were possible.","65":"Therefore, we had to look for our two observations eight years apart.","66":"However, a team of two such observations is not to be found in the catalog of observations we had.","67":"I next turned to the interval of six years, and found at length that from 1585 May 18 and 1591 January 22 suitable observations exist.","68":"For they corresponded to 1585 May 30 at 5h and 1591 January 20 at 0h ^5.","69":"For both, the mean longitude of Mars was 6s 22\u00b0 43'.","70":"The Tychonic equation was 9\u00b0 14' 52\", to be subtracted.","71":"Therefore, Mars's eccentric position was 13\u00b0 28' 16\" Libra.","72":"The equated commutation for 1585 was 8s 4\u00b0 23' 30\", by which it was shown,  Ptolemaic style, that the planet was 64\u00b0 23' 30\" beyond the perigee of the epicycle.","73":"Similarly, the equated commutation for 1591 was 3s 25\u00b0 36' 30\", by which it was shown that the planet was 64\u00b0 23' 30\" before the perigee of the epicycle.","74":"Therefore, both the angles of commutation, FCD and FCE (or CFI, CFH) in the diagram, are equal.","75":"However, in 1585 the sun was in 18\u00b0 Gemini, 18\u00b0 before apogee, and in 1591 in 9\u00b0 Aquarius, 33\u00b0 beyond perigee, and this inequality could not be avoided.","76":"Now to the observations: on 1585 May 18 at 10\u00bdh at night Mars was observed at 0\u00b0 50' 45\" Virgo with latitude 1\u00b0 19' 30\" north ^6.","77":"Magini puts it at 1\u00b0 5' Virgo,7 14' or 15' too much.","78":"Therefore, when on the 30th at 5h in the evening he puts it at 6\u00b0 48' Virgo, we shall again subtract the discrepancy of eleven days previously.","79":"So he will be left with 6\u00b0 34' Virgo.","80":"Here we will assume that some very few minutes are in error because the deduction over 12 days is too great, and the diurnal motion is not exactly the same as that obtained here from Magini.","81":"For consider that on April 18 preceding at 10h Mars was found at 17\u00b0 37\u00bd\u2019 Leo, while Magini puts it at 18\u00b0 0' Leo.","82":"The difference is 22\u00bd\u2019.","83":"Over the 33 days elapsed to May 18 this difference was diminished to the measure of 14\u00bc\u2019 .","84":"So if we extrapolate, since over 33 days eight minutes vanished, in the same ratio, over the 12 following days 3 minutes will vanish.","85":"Therefore, on May 30 the difference will be 11\u00bc\u2019.","86":"So, more accurately, Mars is at 6\u00b0 37' Virgo.","87":"Similarly, on 1591 January 22 at 7h in the morning, Mars was 34\u00b0 32' 45\" from Spica with declination 17\u00b0 25' south, at an altitude of 16\u00b0 ^8.","88":"Therefore, after correction for horizontal variations, the declination was 17\u00b0 30'.","89":"Hence, the right ascension was 230\u00b0 23' 12\", longitude 22\u00b0 33' Scorpio, latitude 1\u00b0 0' 30\" north.","90":"Now this time differs from ours by 1 day 19 hours, and the diurnal motion, from Magini, is 33'.","91":"Therefore, 59' are required for the intervening time.","92":"Therefore, the remainder is the position of Mars on January 20 at 0h (which, as we said, corresponds to the other time): 21\u00b0 34' Scorpio.","93":"Witness the great difference in the equations on the annual orb, despite the promise that the two anomalies of commutation would be equal.","94":"The Copernican hypothesis shows us the cause.","95":"The earth at D and E was considered to be equally distant from the point of uniform motion C, but it was found to be at unequal distances, in such a way that the center of its circuit is at B towards the sun A. And by equivalence, in the Ptolemaic form the epicycle HI is not equally situated about point F, whose  eccentric path the acronychal observations have been describing to us, and about which the epicycle's motion is regular.","96":"And the center of the epicycle G draws towards E, on the same side as the solar perigee.","97":"Similarly, in the Tychonic form the deferent KL of the planetary systems does not go around the earth C at a constant distance, although its motion is regular about this point, but the center M of its circuit draws towards the region of the sun's perigee.","98":"Chapter 23","99":"From the knowledge of two distances of the sun from the earth and of the zodiacal positions and the sun\u2019s apogee, to find the eccentricity of the sun's path (or the earth\u2019s, for Copernicus).","100":"From this it is also not difficult for us to measure the line BC tentatively.","101":"Let FC be 100,000.","102":"And because DFC is 36\u00b0 51' and FCD is 64\u00b0 23' 30\", therefore the remaining angle FDC is 78\u00b0 45' 27\".","103":"And as the sine of this angle is to FC (100,000), so is the sine of DFC to DC, 61,148.","104":"In the same way, because EFC is 38\u00b0 5\u00bd\u2019 minus a little, and FCE is 64\u00b0 23' 30\", FEC will be 77\u00b0 31' 0\" plus a little.","105":"Therefore, EC is 63,186 minus a little.","106":"Let the earth's orb NED be set out, and on it let CBN be the line of apsides, and N perihelion, R aphelion, B the center, C the point of equality of motion, E and D the positions of the two observations, and let these be joined to C and to B. Now EC and CD are known in the same units, and angle ECD is known, viz.","107":"128\u00b0 47' 19\".","108":"Let EC be extended, and let DO be dropped perpendicular to it from D; and also to DE let two perpendiculars CP, BQ be dropped from C and B.","109":"DCO is therefore 51\u00b0 12' 41\", and CDO is 38\u00b0 47' 19\".","110":"Therefore, where DC is 61,148,","111":"DO will be 47,660 and CO 38,305.","112":"And this placed on the end of CE makes EO 101,491.","113":"But from the two given sides DO, OE about a right angle, the magnitude of DEO is obtained: 25\u00b0 9' 20\".","114":"Therefore DE is 112,125.","115":"The half of this, 56,062\u00bd, is the magnitude of DQ, since DB, BE are equal.","116":"And because DEC was 25\u00b0 9' 20\", EDC or PDC will be 26\u00b0 3' 21\".","117":"Therefore, where DC is 61,148, CP will come out to be 26,858 and PD is 54,932.","118":"Subtract this from QD, and the remainder, PQ, is 1130\u00bd.","119":"And now from the known inclination of the lines ED and NC the length CB is easily obtained.","120":"For since CR is the line of the aphelion, at 5\u00b0 30' Capricorn, while CD is at 17\u00b0 52' Sagittarius (because the sun is at 17\u00b0 52' Gemini), DCR will be 17\u00b0 38'.","121":"But EDC was 26\u00b0 3' 21\".","122":"Therefore, after subtraction, there remains the inclination of the lines in question: 8\u00b0 25' 21\".","123":"From P let PS be drawn parallel to CB.","124":"This will be equal to CB, and CP will be equal to BS.","125":"So in right triangle PQS, as the whole sine  is to the tangent and secant of the angle QPS, 8\u00b0 25' 21\", so is the known magnitude of PQ to QS, 167, and SP, 1143, which is CB.","126":"And because PC and SB are equal, with magnitude 26,858, add QS, and QB will come out to be 27,025.","127":"So in the right triangle DQB, given the sides about the right angle, DB will also be given, 62,237.","128":"Therefore, the ratio of DB to BC (the radius to the eccentricity, which is being sought) is the same as 62,237 to 1143.","129":"And as 62,237 is to 100,000 so is 1143 to 1837.","130":"This, at last, is the eccentricity sought.","131":"It would have been less if we had accounted for the","132":"precession of the equinoxes, for then CE would have been less.","133":"And so from these two observations and the accepted true position of the sun's aphelion [sic] there is provided the distance of our equalizing point C or F (which we were considering as center) from the orbit's true center B or C or M, which is 1837 where the radius of its orbit is 100,000.","134":"In contrast, Tycho Brahe found the sun's eccentricity, that is, the distance of the equalizing point C from the center A of the solar body (in Copernicus) or the distance of the equalizing point A of the solar motion from the cen","135":"ter of the earth C (in the Tychonic-Ptolemaic supposition) to be 3584, whose half, 1792, is only slightly different from 1837.","136":"It is therefore fitting that the halving of the eccentricity hold in the theory of the sun, which halving previously held for the eccentric of Mars (in Chapter 19 and 20).","137":"For owing to the large corrections and the use of a controverted value for the diurnal motion, the observations which I have presented are not exact enough to allow anything to be concluded from 45 parts in one hundred thousand, not to mention the ignoring of precession in Mars's and the sun's eccentric motions for the time interval involved.","138":"What has been demonstrated here of the circuit of the earth can be demonstrated in exactly the same way concerning the Ptolemaic epicycle and the Tychonic deferent of the system, provided only that in the diagram the apsides be reversed.","139":"I have supposed here that the sun's apogee established by Tycho was in the right place, and that the orbit of the sun (or earth) which it bodily traverses is arranged in a circle.","140":"Although in Ch.","141":"44 below the analogy with other planets will declare something different, the small breadth of the deflection nonetheless does not in the least vitiate our demonstration.","142":"Chapter 24","143":"A clearer proof that the epicycle or annual orb is eccentric with respect to the point of uniformity.","144":"Such, then, was the beginning of this enquiry, timid and encumbered with so many concerns that the anomaly of commutation be equal on both sides.","145":"Now that we have once made a hazard of this, we are buoyed by audacity  and will begin to be more free on this battlefield.","146":"For I shall seek out three or more observed positions of Mars with the planet always at the same eccentric position, and from these find by trigonometry the distances of that number of points on the epicycle or annual orb from the point of uniform motion.","147":"And since a circle is defined by three points, I shall use triplets of such observations to investigate the position of the circle, its apsides (previously taken as a presupposition), and its eccentricity with respect to the point of uniform motion.","148":"If a fourth observation will be at hand, it will serve as a test.","149":"Let the first time be 1590 March 5 at 7h 10m in the evening, since then Mars had hardly any latitude, and thus no one looking at the demonstration could be troubled by any irrelevant suspicions about the intermingling of latitude.","150":"To this there correspond these moments, in which Mars returns to the same sidereal position: 1592 Jan.","151":"21 at 6h 41m; 1593 Dec.","152":"8 at 6h 12m; 1595 Oct.","153":"26 at 5h 44m ^1.","154":"For the first of these times, Mars's [mean] longitude, according to Tycho's revision, is 1s 4\u00b0 38' 50\", and for subsequent times 1' 36\" greater for each.","155":"For this is the motion of precession corresponding to the periodic time of one return of Mars.","156":"And since Tycho places the apogee at 23\u00bd\u00b0 Leo, its equation will be 11\u00b0 14' 55\", and consequently the equated anomaly in 1590 will be 1s 15\u00b0 53' 45\".","157":"Now at the same time, the commutation, or difference of the mean, motions of the sun and Mars, is reckoned to be 10s 18\u00b0 19' 56\", so the equated [commutation], or the difference between the sun's mean motion and Mars's equated eccentric motion, is 10s 7\u00b0 5' 1\".","158":"We shall present this first in the Copernican form, since it is simpler to perceive.","159":"Let \u03b1 be the point of uniform motion of the earth's circuit, and let this be considered to be the circle \u03b4\u03b3 described about \u03b1, and let the sun be on the side \u03b2, such that the  line of the sun's apogee \u03b1\u03b2 lies in the direction of 5\u00bd\u00b0 Cancer, even though we are going to investigate this degree freely, as if unknown, in Ch.","160":"25.","161":"And let the earth be on \u03b1\u03b8 in 1590, \u03b1\u03b7 in 1592, \u03b1\u03b5 in 1593, and \u03b1\u03b6 in 1595.","162":"And the angles \u03b8\u03b1\u03b7, \u03b7\u03b1\u03b5, \u03b5\u03b1\u03b6 are equal, since \u03b1 is the point of uniform motion and the periodic times of Mars are presupposed equal.","163":"And let the planet at these four times be at \u03ba, and its line of apsides be \u03b1\u03bb.","164":"Thus the angle \u03b8\u03b1\u03ba, according to the measure of the equated anomaly of commutation, is 127\u00b0 5' l\" ^2.","165":"As for the observed position of Mars, at the same time on the preceding day, the fourth,3 it was at 24\u00b0 22' Aries ^4.","166":"Its diurnal motion for the day would be 44'.","167":"Therefore, at our time it was seen at 25\u00b0 6' Aries, which is the position of the line \u03b8\u03ba.","168":"But \u03b1\u03ba is directed towards 15\u00b0 53' 45\" Taurus.","169":"Therefore, \u03b8\u03ba\u03b1 is 20\u00b0 47' 45\".","170":"So the remainder \u03b1\u03b8\u03ba to make up two right angles is 32\u00b0 7' 14\".","171":"Now as the sine of \u03b1\u03b8\u03ba is to \u03b1\u03ba, which we shall say is 100,000 units, so is [the sine of] \u03b8\u03ba\u03b1 to \u03b8\u03b1, which is what is sought.","172":"Therefore, \u03b8\u03b1 is 66,774.","173":"Now if the remaining lines \u03b7\u03b1, \u03b5\u03b1, \u03b6\u03b1, will turn out to be of the same length, my suspicion will be false, but if they are different, my triumph will be complete.","174":"Second, then, in 1592 at our moment the equated longitude was 1s 15\u00b0 55' 23\"; the equated commutation was 8s 24\u00b0 10' 34\" \u2014 that is, the angle \u03b7\u03b1\u03ba is

\u03b7\u03ba\u03b1 is 35\u00b0 46' 23\", and \u03b1\u03b7\u03ba is 60\u00b0 3' 3\", and \u03b1\u03b7 is 67,467, now  longer than \u03b1\u03b8.","180":"This is doubtless because the sun has descended towards perigee, and the earth has been moved from \u03b8 to \u03b7; thus, in this region the sun is found beyond \u03b2 at a nearer point.","181":"Third, in 1593 at our moment the equated longitude was 1s 15\u00b0 56' 56\", the equated commutation was 7s 11\u00b0 16' 16\", which makes \u03b5\u03b1\u03ba 41\u00b0 16' 16\".","182":"It was observed December 10 at 7h 20m at 4\u00b0 45' Aries,

they have equal periods.","201":"And let \u0391\u039b be Mars's line of apsides.","202":"Let \u0391\u039a, \u0391\u039b be parallel to \u03b1\u03ba, \u03b1\u03bb in the preceding Copernican form.","203":"From the center of the earth \u0391, let the lines \u0391\u0398, \u0391\u0397, \u0391\u0395, \u0391\u0396 be drawn parallel to the previous lines \u03ba\u03b8, \u03ba\u03b7, \u03ba\u03b5, \u03ba\u03b6, and equal to them, so that Mars is at \u0398 in 1590, at \u0397 in 1592, at \u0395 in 1593, and at \u0396 in 1595; and at the same time the sun's mean position at those times is \u0391\u03a4, \u0391\u0399, \u0391\u039f, \u0391\u03a7, respectively, so that \u039a\u0398 and \u0391\u03a4 are parallel (as is known from the Ptolemaic hypothesis), and so","204":"on for the rest.","205":"With \u0398, \u0397, \u0395, and \u0396 connected with \u039a, it will be demonstrated as before, with exactly the same numbers, lines, and angles, that these lines are unequal, contrary to common opinion, and consequently that Mars does not traverse the circle \u0393\u0394, whose center is at the center of uniform motion \u039a, but the circle \u0396\u0397\u0395\u0398 instead, whose center lies in the direction of \u0392 from \u039a, very near to the line \u039a\u0392, which should be parallel to the line drawn from the earth \u0391 through the sun's perigee.","206":"Therefore, the epicycle's apogee lies in the direction of the sun's perigee.","207":"And because the epicycle, owing to the total equivalence just mentioned, is to be supposed equal to the sun's circuit, with \u0396\u039a parallel to \u03a7\u0391, \u0395\u039a to \u039f\u0391, \u0397\u039a to \u0399\u0391, and \u0398\u039a to \u03a4\u0391, it is also likely that \u03a7\u0391, \u039f\u0391, \u0399\u0391, and \u03a4\u0391 are unequal, and that the point of the sun's mean position (the center of the sun's epicycle, in the Brahean conception) does not stand at the same distance from the point of uniform motion throughout its circuit.","208":"This I remark only in passing: it has no effect upon the present demonstration, but serves as an extension to it.","209":"In the Tychonic form, let A be the earth, and about it let the sun's concentric CD be described, and let this be considered to be the deferent of the system of the planets, since A is the point of uniform motion of the sun's concentric.","210":"Therefore the sun itself will be on another eccentric circle.","211":"Let its center be in the direction of B from A. Now let AL be the reference for Mars's line of apsides, so that the line of apsides, in the circling and translating of its eccentric, remains ever parallel to AL.","212":"And let the lines of the sun's mean motion at our four moments be AH, AT, AE, AS, and from A let the lines along which Mars is observed be extended in the direction of one or another degree of the zodiac in accordance with the description above.","213":"And since at all four","214":"times Mars is supposed to be at the same place on the eccentric, its distances from the points of the sun's mean position will all be equal and parallel.","215":"Let them be GH, FT, IE, and KS, all equal, and let the angles LHG, LTF, LEI, LSK, all be equal to the previous angle \u039b\u0391\u039a or \u03bb\u03b1\u03ba, so that at our moments Mars might be at G, F, I, K. I would note in passing that these four points G, F, I, K, in actual fact will make an arc exactly equal in length and placement to the previous arc \u0398\u0397\u0395\u0396 in the Ptolemaic form.","216":"This is because there is no difference between the two other than that Ptolemy has an epicycle, equal to the [circle of the] theory of the sun, carried around on an eccentric, while Tycho has the eccentric carried around on the [circle of the] theory of the sun or on a circle equal to the Ptolemaic epicycle.","217":"Once again, then, with the angles and numbers remaining the same, it will be demonstrated, contrary to common opinion, that the lines AH, AT, AE, AS are unequal.","218":"And so that point on the eccentric whence originates the eccentricity of Mars and all the planets (which is here considered to be on the line of the sun's mean motion, following earlier practitioners) does not go around on that circle DC about whose center A it makes equal angles in equal times, but on the circle HTES whose center lies in the direction opposite the center of the sun's eccentric B, as has thus far become roughly clear from the lines themselves.","219":"Chapter 25","220":"From three distances of the sun from the center of the world, with known zodiacal positions, to find the apogee and eccentricity of the sun or earth.","221":"I shall now once again test the quantity of the eccentricity and the position of the apogee in a single circle adapted to all three forms.","222":"For it is easily seen that they are simply opposites: for example, in the Copernican form the longest line is towards Gemini, while in the other forms it is towards Sagittarius.","223":"This is because Copernicus's observer is looking towards the center, and the others are looking away from it.","224":"Thus Copernicus too looks across the center at the same parts of the zodiac as the others.","225":"Let the circle \u03b8\u03b7\u03b5\u03b6, with center \u03b2, be set out, in which from the given point \u03b1 there are the given lines \u03b1\u03b8, \u03b1\u03b7, \u03b1\u03b5, and \u03b1\u03b6, as before, with the angles about \u03b1 also given, for each of them is 42\u00b0 52' 47\".","226":"What is sought is both the magnitude \u03b1\u03b2 and the direction of that line with respect to the fixed stars or to the other lines.","227":"Let \u03b8, \u03b7, and \u03b5 be selected and joined with one another, since three points suffice for investigating this.","228":"First, in the triangle \u03b8\u03b1\u03b7 the sides and the included angle are given, \u03b8\u03b7 is sought, and is shown by trigonometry to be 49, 1691 in the same units in which the sides \u03b1\u03b8 and \u03b1\u03b7 were expressed.","229":"Second, in triangle \u03b1\u03b5\u03b7 the angle \u03b1\u03b5\u03b7 is sought, and found to be 68\u00b0 12' 26\".","230":"Third, in the triangle \u03b8\u03b1\u03b5 the angle \u03b1\u03b5\u03b8 is sought, and is found to be 46\u00b0 39' 10\", which, subtracted from \u03b1\u03b5\u03b7 leaves 21\u00b0 33' 16\", which is the angle at the circumference \u03b8\u03b5\u03b7.","231":"Therefore, twice this amount, 43\u00b0 6' 32\", will be \u03b8\u03b2\u03b7, the angle at the center, because \u03b2 is by supposition the center of the circle.","232":"So in the isosceles triangle \u03b8\u03b2\u03b7 the angles are given, as well as the side \u03b8\u03b7 found previously.","233":"The size of \u03b8\u03b2, the radius of the circle, is sought, and found to be 66,923.","234":"And since \u03b2\u03b8\u03b7 is 68\u00b0 26' 44\", while before, when \u03b8\u03b7 was being found, \u03b1\u03b8\u03b7 was 69\u00b0 18' 46\", \u03b2\u03b8\u03b1 is therefore 0\u00b0 52' 2\".","235":"Next, in the triangle \u03b2\u03b8\u03b1, from the sides and the included angle, \u03b8\u03b1\u03b2 and \u03b1\u03b2 are sought.","236":"And the angle \u03b8\u03b1\u03b2 is found to be 97\u00b0 50' 30\", so that \u03b1\u03b2 is at 15\u00b0 8' 30\" Gemini, because \u03b1\u03b8 is at 22\u00b0 59' Virgo.","237":"Tycho, however, places the sun's apogee at 5\u00bd\u00b0 Cancer.","238":"So you see that this very free enquiry has brought us within 20\u00b0 of the correct Tychonic position.","239":"Also, \u03b1\u03b2 is found to be 1023, and if \u03b8\u03b2 be taken as 100,000, \u03b1\u03b2 will become 1530.","240":"But the whole solar eccentricity is 3592, and its half is 1796 or 1800.","241":"So here somewhat less than half of the solar eccentricity is claimed for the eccentricity of our circle.","242":"But you should bear in mind that observations near minimum values may be somewhat in error, and that use was made of a questionable mean longitude and equation from Tycho.","243":"This will become quite clear if you will carry out the same operation with the angle \u03b8\u03b7\u03b6, and then with \u03b7\u03b5\u03b6 and \u03b8\u03b5\u03b6.","244":"For each time, \u03b1\u03b2 has a somewhat different magnitude, and its position beneath the fixed stars will fall one side or the other of 5\u00bd\u00b0 Capricorn and Cancer.","245":"Consequently, we shall look into this more carefully below, where in many instances, through a fine demonstration, the eccentricity will be found to be half the solar eccentricity, and the apogee very near the Tychonic one.","246":"It has thus been demonstrated in the Copernican form that the center of the earth's circuit is halfway between the sun's body and the point of uniform motion of that circuit.","247":"That is, that the earth proceeds nonuniformly on its orbit, slowing when it recedes far from the sun and speeding up when it approaches.","248":"This is in conformity with physical principles and with the analogy with other planets.","249":"In the same way it has been demonstrated in the Ptolemaic form that the epicycle is eccentric with respect to the point about which its motion is uniform, and that its eccentricity is half of the sun's eccentricity as it is commonly determined, and in the opposite direction.","250":"Finally, in the Tychonic form it has been demonstrated that the point whence originate the planets' eccentricities does not move on the sun's concentric, but throughout its course is unequally distant from the earth, about which it moves regularly and uniformly; and that it is farther away near the sun's perigee, and nearer at apogee, again by half of the sun's eccentricity.","251":"And so, since this Ptolemaic epicycle and this Brahean deferent have so great an analogy with the theory of the sun, it is likely that they also have a greater analogy: that is, the sun's true eccentricity, too, will only be half of that computed from the maximum equation; or, what is the same thing, the sun will make use of an equant, whose eccentricity is twice the eccentric's eccentricity.","252":"I admit that this line of argument is a little weaker when applied to the Ptolemaic and Tychonic form, insofar as we are using the sun's mean motion, following the authorities.","253":"The argument consequently will become clearer when, moved by those reasons adduced in Chapter 6 above, I measure out the planet's motion by the sun's apparent motion.","254":"Chapter 26","255":"demonstration from the same observations that the epicycle is eccentric with respect to the point of attachment or axis, and that the annual orb (and so also the earth's path around the sun, or the sun's around the earth) is eccentric with respect to the body of the sun or earth, with an eccentricity just half that which Tycho Brahe found through equations of the sun's motion.","256":"We shall now go through the observations1 again, carefully: On 1590 March 4 at 7h 10m, Mars was found by careful observation and calculation to be at 24\u00b0 22' 56\" Aries with latitude 0\u00b0 3' 20\" S. At that time, 8\u00b0 Aries was setting, so Mars was rather low.","257":"Therefore, it was raised up towards the east by refraction, so it seems right that without refraction it would have been seen at 24\u00b0 20' Aries.","258":"Its parallax can only be very small, particularly at this distance, for Mars was near the sun and therefore had receded very far from the center of the earth.","259":"On 1592 January 23 at 7h 20m, using only one stellar distance from Mars, without the confirmation of another, Mars was found at 11\u00b0 32' 44\" Aries with latitude 0\u00b0 1' 36\" S. And so we shall make no changes for horizontal variations, although we suspect an uncertainty of one or two minutes.","260":"On 1593 December 7 at 8h 0m Mars was found at 3\u00b0 6' 50\" Aries with no danger of horizontal variation, with latitude 7\u2019 9\" S. However, the right ascension found using three stars showed a discrepancy of 4', and the value taken as true was the mean between the extremes.","261":"On 1595 October 25 at 8h 10m, the planet's distance from three fixed stars was observed, and by unanimous consensus the planet was found to be at 19\u00b0 39' 25\" [Taurus] with latitude 0\u00b0 12' 41\" S.","262":"Now we shall reduce the three subsequent times to the first.","263":"Accordingly, to its sidereal position","264":"The motion over three days and 35 minutes of time in 1592 was 2\u00b0 9' 4\", according to Magini ^2.","265":"Therefore, at our time Mars was seen at 9\u00b0 23' 40\" [Aries].","266":"In 1593 the motion over 1 hour 45 min., from the diurnal motion of 33', is 2' 25\".","267":"And so at our time Mars's position comes out to be 3\u00b0 4' 27\" Aries.","268":"Likewise, in 1595 the motion over 2 hours 25 min., from a diurnal motion of 22' 11\", is 2' 14\".","269":"Therefore at our time the position of Mars comes out to be 19\u00b0 41' 39\" Taurus.","270":"FROM THIS THERE FOLLOWS THE TABLE OF POSITIONS","271":"Now because we have proposed to enquire how far the earth is from the center of the sun, we will need first of all to use the hypothesis constructed above in Ch.","272":"16, from oppositions to the sun's apparent position, to find the position of the line drawn from the center of the sun through the body of Mars to the zodiac.","273":"And on 1595 October 25 at 5h 45m that line is found at 14\u00b0 19' 52\" Taurus.","274":"Therefore, for the three other times it is set back each time by 1' 36\".","275":"Thus, in 1593 it was at 14\u00b0 18' 16\" Taurus; in 1592, at 14\u00b0 16' 40\" Taurus; and in 1590, at 14\u00b0 15' 4\" Taurus.","276":"Let the First Diagram be in Copernicus\u2019s Form","277":"And let \u03b1 be the center of the sun; \u03b2 the center of Mars's eccentric, drawn through \u03bf; \u03c7 the center of uniform motion for Mars's eccentric; \u03b3 the center of the earth's eccentric; \u03b4, \u03b5, \u03b6, \u03b7 four positions of the earth, opposite the sun's apparent positions; \u03b8 the position of Mars on its eccentric.","278":"Let all points be connected with one another.","279":"3","280":"We shall now test the magnitude of the eccentricity that may be deduced from these distances.","281":"If the sun's theory lacks an equant, the eccentricity of its circle will turn out to be about 3600.","282":"This is because we used the true or apparent positions of the sun, whose point of uniform motion has to be that far (namely, 3600) from the center of the world, as Brahe has proved from solar observations.","283":"But if, on the other hand, the eccentricity turns out to be less, and is about half the Brahean value, we have won, and vindicated our contention, that the point of uniform motion found by Brahe is not the center of the sun's eccentric.","284":"You can see at a glance (I would note in passing) that \u03b1\u03b6 is the shortest, it being near the sun's perigee; next, that \u03b1\u03b5 is longer, it being in Aquarius, 34 degrees from perigee; then \u03b1\u03b7, it being 54 degrees from perigee; and lastly, that \u03b1\u03b4 is longest, because it is 80 degrees from perigee.","285":"And since \u03b1\u03b6 is almost at perigee, it will be hardly any longer than the shortest.","286":"Similarly, since \u03b1\u03b4 is near the middle elongation, it will be only a little less than the mean distance.","287":"Therefore, the eccentricity will come out to be a little greater than 1038, which is the difference between \u03b4\u03b1 and \u03b6\u03b1.","288":"And if \u03b4\u03b1 is assigned the measure of 100,000, 1038 will have the value 1539; and this is about what the eccentricity will amount to (it is actually a little greater).","289":"And this is much closer to 1800, half the Tychonic value, than to the full value of 3600.","290":"The same is to be said of the sun's apogee.","291":"For because \u03b6\u03b1 is shortest, the perigee is about 25\u00b0 53' Sagittarius.","292":"And because \u03b5\u03b1 is shorter than \u03b7\u03b1, the perigee is closer to 10\u00b0 17' Aquarius than to 11\u00b0 42' Scorpio.","293":"But the mean is 25\u00b0 57' Sagittarius.","294":"Therefore, the perigee is beyond 25\u00b0 57' Sagittarius and before 10\u00b0 17' Aquarius; that is, in Capricorn.","295":"This I wanted to give as a foretaste to make up for the coming labors.","296":"For now I shall follow the geometric path to investigate the position of the apogee and the eccentricity.","297":"And since three points determine a circle, I shall at first use the points \u03b4, \u03b6, and \u03b7.\nI proceed as in Ch.","298":"25 above.","299":"Since the points \u03b4, \u03b6, \u03b7 are placed on a single circumference with center \u03b3, the angle \u03b4\u03b7\u03b6 will be half of the angle \u03b4\u03b3\u03b6, and its measure will be the arc \u03b4\u03b6.","300":"Therefore, the ratio of \u03b4\u03b6 to the radius \u03b4\u03b3, and to the eccentricity \u03b3\u03b1, will be given, together with the angle \u03b4\u03b1\u03b3, because \u03b1\u03b3 lies in the direction of the apsides.","301":"But for the knowledge of the angle \u03b4\u03b7\u03b6 and of the line \u03b4\u03b6, we need to solve the three triangles.","302":"4","303":"And yet it was said before that using \u03b4 and \u03b6 the eccentricity comes out to be a little greater than 1539, supposing that \u03b6 is nearest to perigee.","304":"But since here (letting \u03b7 be received into the company in place of \u03b6) the eccentricity comes out much greater, this hints, although erroneously, that there is some line at perigee which is still shorter than \u03b1\u03b6.","305":"In order that this distance at perigee might be able to be shorter than \u03b1\u03b6, this line of argument has moved the perigee to 16 Capricorn, that is, farther from \u03b1\u03b6.","306":"But since we already know that the sun's perigee is not in 16 Capricorn but in 6 Capricorn, it is appropriate to assign the cause of the slight error to the point \u03b7 and to the excessive length of the line \u03b1\u03b7 ^5.","307":"For the result of this is that the circle \u03b4\u03b5\u03b7 would be too large, and its radius \u03b4\u03b3 too long; and consequently \u03b3\u03b1 would be too long, and \u03b3 would move perpendicularly away from the line \u03b4\u03b7, but obliquely from the point \u03b6. Thus, the line \u03b3\u03b1 would now be placed too far to the east.","308":"Therefore, letting \u03b4 and \u03b3 remain, let \u03b1\u03b7 be supposed shorter.","309":"Then the center \u03b3 moves perpendicularly toward the line \u03b4\u03b7, and \u03b4\u03b3 thus becomes shorter.","310":"And because \u03b3 approaches \u03b4\u03b7 perpendicularly, it recedes obliquely from the present \u03b3\u03b1.","311":"Hence, if a straight line be drawn from \u03b1 through the new position of \u03b3, it will be inclined back towards \u03b4.","312":"You thus see how shortening \u03b1\u03b7 helps us in two ways.","313":"But to shorten \u03b1\u03b7 is a very easy, small change, because the angles are small: it can be done by saying that the planet was seen in a slightly prior position along a line drawn from \u03b7 below \u03b8.","314":"6 For example, let the observed position of Mars be 19\u00b0 40' Taurus, and the supplement \u03b1\u03b7\u03b8 be 7\u00b0 58' 26\", and \u03b7\u03b8\u03b1 5\u00b0 20' 8\": then \u03b1\u03b7 will be 67,030.","315":"The second and third triangles are then changed, \u03b1\u03b7\u03b4 becoming 23\u00b0 53' 0\", and \u03b1\u03b7\u03b6 67\u00b0 15' 32\".","316":"Therefore, \u03b4\u03b7\u03b6 is 43\u00b0 22' 26\", and \u03b4\u03b3\u03b6 86\u00b0 44' 52\".","317":"The remaining  angles are 93\u00b0 15' 8\", whose half, \u03b3\u03b4\u03b6, is 46\u00b0 37' 34\", and \u03b3\u03b4\u03b1 is 1\u00b0 10' 12\".","318":"Hence \u03b4\u03b3 is 67,892.","319":"And where this is 100000, \u03b1\u03b4 will be 99,416, and \u03b4\u03b3\u03b1 73\u00b0 24' 39\".","320":"Consequently the perigee is in 10\u00b0 36' Capricorn, and the eccentricity is still about 2100.","321":"Thus, as the true perigee was approached the eccentricity decreased, and so when we get exactly to the correct perigee we shall also get exactly to the halving of the eccentricity.","322":"But it is nonetheless worthwhile to find out, in addition, how much we gain by changing the line \u03b1\u03b8, adding one minute to the computed eccentric position of Mars while keeping fixed the point of observation (that is, the point \u03b7) for the year 1595.","323":"With \u03b1\u03b8 accordingly moved forward, if these lines of sight \u03b7\u03b8, \u03b6\u03b8, and the rest were to stay the same, it would come about that \u03b1\u03b8 would be intersected by \u03b7\u03b8 at a place higher than \u03b8; and on the other hand it would be intersected by \u03b6\u03b8 and its counterparts at a place lower than \u03b8.","324":"7 So \u03b1\u03b8 would not keep the same length.","325":"But since we are supposing that Mars is at the same eccentric position all four times, the length of \u03b1\u03b8 will also be the same for all four times.","326":"Therefore, in order that the point of intersection \u03b8 be the same, and nonetheless the lines of sight go towards their original zodiacal positions, it will be necessary to draw a line parallel to \u03b7\u03b8 somewhat lower, thus making \u03b1\u03b7 shorter; and also a line outside \u03b6\u03b8 and parallel to it, by which \u03b1\u03b6 would be lengthened; and so on for the rest.","327":"Next, the whole labor is to be repeated from the beginning.","328":"For \u03b4\u03b5\u03b8\u03b1 will now be 19\u00b0 56' 4\", \u03b5\u03b8\u03b1 34\u00b0 53' 40\", \u03b6\u03b8\u03b1 41\u00b0 14' 46\", and \u03b7\u03b8\u03b1 5\u00b0 21' 8\".","329":"Therefore \u03b4\u03b1 will be 67,522, \u03b5\u03b1 66,660, \u03b6\u03b1 66,451, \u03b7\u03b1 66,963.","330":"Hence, \u03b1\u03b4\u03b6 will be 45\u00b0 26' 37\", \u03b1\u03b7\u03b4 23\u00b0 54' 30\", \u03b1\u03b7\u03b6 67\u00b0 20' 48\".","331":"And \u03b4\u03b7\u03b6 will be 43\u00b0 26' 18\", and \u03b4\u03b3\u03b6 86\u00b0 52' 36\", \u03b3\u03b4\u03b6 46\u00b0 33' 42\", and \u03b3\u03b4\u03b1 1\u00b0 7' 5\"- a different angle from different beginnings.","332":"Now, when \u03b1\u03b6 is divided by the sine \u03b1\u03b4\u03b6, and the quotient multiplied by the sine of \u03b4\u03b1\u03b6, the product is \u03b4\u03b6, 93,252.","333":"Again, when this is divided into the sine of \u03b4\u03b3\u03b6, and the quotient is multiplied by the sine of \u03b4\u03b6\u03b3, the product will be \u03b4\u03b3, 67,823.","334":"Hence the angle \u03b4\u03b3\u03b1 is 76\u00b0 37\u2019 30\", and the perigee is at 7\u00b0 23' Capricorn, with an eccentricity about 1880, which would clearly be 1800 if the perigee were brought back to 5\u00bd Capricorn, as could happen through the combined effect of both causes.","335":"For if you now subtract only half a minute from the apparent position for 1595, we will be within range.","336":"And there could easily be a one minute error in the equations of the eccentric found by the hypothesis of Chapter 16.","337":"So, since the result is easily vitiated by the data from 1595, let us now omit them and use the remaining three points \u03b4, \u03b5, \u03b6, keeping the most recent correction of eccentric position, and forming the new triangles \u03b4\u03b1\u03b5 and \u03b5\u03b1\u03b6.","338":"8","339":"And because \u03b4\u03b6 remains 93,252, as before, dividing the sine of \u03b3\u03b4\u03b6 by the sine of \u03b4\u03b3\u03b6 and multiplying the quotient by \u03b4\u03b6 gives \u03b3\u03b4 as 67,873.","340":"But \u03b1\u03b4 is 67,522.","341":"From this and \u03b3\u03b4, \u03b4\u03b3\u03b1 is found to be 75\u00b0 8' 40\" and the perigee in 8 51 45 Capricorn, about what it was before.","342":"The eccentricity, somewhat more than 2000, is to be decreased to 1800 (as before), if the perigee were to be moved back to 5\u00bd\u00b0 Capricorn.","343":"This is accomplished by lengthening \u03b1\u03b5.","344":"And \u03b1\u03b5 is lengthened if we say that the planet appeared one or two minutes before 9\u00b0 24' Aries.","345":"For then, from the point \u03b8 set up by the other lines of observation, some line would be drawn outside \u03b8\u03b5 towards \u03b8\u03b6.","346":"One might, however, hold suspect such license in making small changes in the data, thinking that by taking the same liberty in changing whatever we don't like in the observations, the full Tychonic eccentricity might also at last be obtained.","347":"Anyone who thinks this way should make a try at it, and, comparing his changes with ours, he should judge whether the changes remain within the limits of observational precision.","348":"He also needs to beware lest, elated by a trust in one such iteration, he render himself all the more guilty afterwards, because of the very divergent apogees found for the sun.","349":"I, to be sure, have laid all my prejudices and preferences out in the open here, so that I am more afraid of appearing to the reader to be importunate than I am of seeming untrustworthy.","350":"And by the way, a remark for future use: if \u03b3\u03b4 is made 100,000, \u03b1\u03b8 will come out to be 147,443, or even greater when the figures that are still missing  are obtained correctly.","351":"Finally, to avoid prolixity, if \u03b1\u03b8 be 147,700, and the eccentric position of Mars in 1595 be 14\u00b0 21' 7\" Taurus, and the eccentricity of the earth be 1800, and the earth's path oval, as will be said in Chapters 30 and 44, the appearances will come out to be","352":"And thus it has been demonstrated that \u03b1\u03b3 is about 1800, although it ought to have been 3600 if Tycho's discoveries were accommodated to the Copernican form and the sun's apparent motions.","353":"Consequently the point \u03c0 of the earth's uniformity of motion must be sought on the line \u03b1\u03c0, so that \u03b3\u03c0 and \u03b3\u03b1 are equal.","354":"For if the earth is moved uniformly about \u03c0, that is, if \u03b4\u03c0\u03b5, \u03b5\u03c0\u03b6, \u03b6\u03c0\u03b7 are equal, Tycho's observations of the sun will remain unaltered, and \u03c0\u03b9\u03b1 will be 3600.","355":"And at the same time, since the earth will be at the same distance from point \u03b3 when at the points \u03b4, \u03b5, \u03b6, \u03b7, the observations of Mars will also remain unchanged.","356":"Second Diagram: Ptolemaic Form9","357":"In the Ptolemaic form, the delineation can be done in two ways.","358":"In the first, let the earth replace the solar body at \u03b1, and then lines of vision be drawn out from \u03b1 parallel to \u03b4\u03b8, \u03b5\u03b8, \u03b6\u03b8, \u03b7\u03b8, so that the Copernican positions of the earth \u03b4, \u03b5, \u03b6, \u03b7  coalesce into one Ptolemaic position of the earth.","359":"Meanwhile, let the star Mars, which for Copernicus had stayed at one point \u03b8, now be placed about \u03b8 at four locations: \u03b9, \u03ba, \u03bb, \u03bc. The description of this circle is as follows.","360":"Upward through \u03b8 let \u03b8\u03bd be drawn equal and parallel to \u03b3\u03b1.","361":"And about center \u03bd, with radius \u03b3\u03b5, let the circle \u03b9\u03ba\u03bb\u03bc be  described.","362":"Thus the point \u03b8, which we can call the point of attachment, moves around on the eccentric, which before, in Copernicus, the planet bodily traversed.","363":"While the epicycle is thus being borne around, the center \u03bd is driven around \u03b8, so that at one time it is inside \u03b8\u03b1 and at another it is outside; however, \u03b8\u03bd is always parallel to itself and to the line \u03b1\u03b3.","364":"And the epicycle will be moved uniformly, not about \u03b8 to which it is attached, nor about its center \u03bd, but about a higher point, \u03bf, such that \u03b8\u03bf is twice \u03b8\u03bd.","365":"For the earth too will thus be moved10 uniformly about \u03c0, not about the center of its orb \u03b3, nor about the sun at \u03b1.","366":"That these characteristics belong to the Ptolemaic epicycle, is properly demonstrated.","367":"But that they are carried over from the epicycle to the theory of the sun is shown by a probable argument only, pieced together from Ptolemaic opinions.","368":"For, keeping everything as it was, let \u03b1\u03c4 be set up equal to \u03b1\u03c0 and in the same line but in the opposite direction, so that \u03c4\u03b1 may be the center of the sun's uniform motion, which the theorists had thought to be the center of the sun's orbit.","369":"Therefore, the line \u03b8\u03bd\u03bf will always be parallel to the line of the sun's apogee \u03b1\u03c4.","370":"Now, if you decide that the diurnal parallax of Mars should be kept in the same ratio to the sun's parallax as that given out by Tycho, \u03b9\u03ba\u03bb\u03bc will also be equal to the [circle of the] sun's theory, and consequently \u03b8\u03bf will also be equal to the eccentricity of the point \u03c4, about which the sun moves uniformly.","371":"But \u03b9\u03ba\u03bb\u03bc also moves in the same direction in which the sun moves on its circle, according to Ptolemy, and at the same times both the sun on its eccentric and the planet on its epicycle are found in the same, or at least corresponding, places, so that lines from \u03c4 through the sun and from \u03bf through the planet are ever parallel, again as taught by Ptolemy.","372":"So, since all other things are in agreement, why not this, too: that, just as \u03b9\u03ba\u03bb\u03bc is moved uniformly, not about the center \u03bd but about the point \u03bf above it, as is demonstrated here by the transposition of the eccentric of the earth into the epicycle, where we took \u03b8 in place of \u03b1, \u03bd for \u03b3, and \u03bf for \u03c0: so likewise, these points are distinct in the sun, so that the eccentricity \u03b1\u03c4, which is found from solar observations, is to be bisected at \u03be, with \u03be the center of the sun's eccentric \u03bb\u03c1\u03c3\u03c5?","373":"For Ptolemy made use of such a procedure to make it appear that if the sun's apparent positions were used, exactly the same eccentricity would be used on the planet's epicycle as was found in the sun.","374":"So since the observations give evidence of the double eccentricity of the Ptolemaic epicycle (because, as was said, the parallel relationships of the lines leave the triangles the same as in the Copernican form), the spirit of Ptolemy urges us to bisect the sun's eccentricity as well, so that the lines \u03bb\u03b9, \u03c1\u03ba, \u03c3\u03bb, \u03c5\u03bc remain parallel.","375":"So by this reasoning even Ptolemy will be persuaded that \u03b1\u03c4, the eccentricity of the sun's motion found by Tycho, should be bisected at \u03be, so that the center of the sun's orbit is at \u03be, and the uniformity of motion at \u03c4.","376":"Now this argument in the Ptolemaic form (as I just now began to say) is no firmer than the Ptolemaic world system itself.","377":"For anyone who believes Ptolemy, thinking that for the three superior planets there are three theories  of epicycles, exactly equal to the theory of the sun, in quantity and quality, in lines as well as motions, in absolutely all respects\u2014this same person will not admit this one inconsistency, but will also gladly derive this bisection for the solar theory from the epicycle, as if from an image in a mirror to the face itself.","378":"And finally, when a comparison of hypotheses has been made, and it has appeared that four theories of the sun (or rather, six, as will be said elsewhere) can be generated from a single theory of the earth, like many images from one substantial face, the sun itself, the clearest of truth, will melt all this Ptolemaic apparatus like butter, and will disperse the followers of Ptolemy, some to Copernicus's camp, and some to Brahe's.","379":"Here, one might raise a question.","380":"The Ptolemaic epicycle has three notable points: the center \u03bd, the point \u03b8 which we have called the point of attachment, and the point \u03bf about which its motion is uniform.","381":"Now since it is said that the line \u03b8\u03bf remains parallel to \u03b1\u03c4 throughout the entire circuit, what are the properties of the circuits described by the other two points \u03bd and \u03bf?","382":"In order to show this, let lines be drawn from \u03be and \u03c4\u03b1 parallel to \u03b1\u03b2, and from \u03b2 and \u03c7 parallel to \u03b1\u03c4, and let them be extended so as to intersect one another; and let the intersection of the lines from \u03be and \u03b2 be \u03c6, from \u03be and \u03c7 be \u03c8, from \u03c4 and \u03b2 be \u03c2, and from \u03c4 and \u03c7 be \u03c9. Now, just as the point \u03b8 is moved regularly around \u03c7, traversing an eccentric described about \u03b2, so also \u03bd is moved regularly around \u03c8, traversing an eccentric described about \u03c6. Also, \u03bf is moved regularly about \u03c9, traversing a third eccentric likewise equal to the others, described about \u03c2. For all three of these eccentrics the zodiacal position of the apogee is the same, owing to the lines' \u03b1\u03c7, \u03be\u03c8, \u03c4\u03c9 being parallel.","383":"But the word \"apogee\" cannot be applied properly to any of these, apart from the first, that belongs to the point \u03b8, since its line of apsides \u03b1\u03b2\u03c7 is drawn through the earth itself, which was placed at \u03b1, but not at \u03be or \u03c4.","384":"It is indeed true that straight lines can be drawn from the earth \u03b1 through the centers of the remaining two eccentrics \u03c6 and \u03c2, which may properly be called \"lines of the apogee\".","385":"These will fall to the west of the apogee \u03b1\u03c7; that is, \u03b1\u03c6 will be at 24\u00b0 Leo, and \u03b1\u03c2 at 19\u00b0 Leo, approximately.","386":"But then these lines will not pass through the pertinent point of uniform motion of each eccentric.","387":"Thus, if any of Ptolemy\u2019s followers does not wish to attach the epicycle to the eccentric at the point \u03b8, but prefers to relate it to the center \u03bd, he will be driven to use two lines of apsides: one, \u03b1\u03c6, for the eccentric, and the other, \u03b1\u03c8, for the equant; and also two eccentricities, \u03b1\u03c6 and \u03b1\u03c8.","388":"How intricate and inconvenient this is (for of its absurdity enough has been said in Chapter 6), let anyone so inclined judge.","389":"The same will happen if anyone wishes to attach the epicycle to the eccentric at the point \u03bf, about which the epicycle revolves uniformly.","390":"For then the eccentric bearing  the point \u03bf will have two apogees and eccentricities, one for the center on the line \u03b1\u03c2, and the other for the point of uniformity of motion on the line \u03b1\u03c9.","391":"The remaining possibilities are either to attach the epicycle at \u03b8, or improperly to take apogees for the eccentrics that bear the points \u03bd and \u03bf, and to compute the eccentricities from the points \u03be and \u03c4, not from the reference point, the earth \u03b1.","392":"What has been given so far is the first delineation in the Ptolemaic form.","393":"The other can be constructed as follows.","394":"Let the Copernican positions of the earth \u03b4, \u03b5, \u03b6, \u03b7, merge, not in \u03b1, but in \u03b3, so that in this diagram, \u03b3, not \u03b1, denotes the earth, the center of the world.","395":"Here, the epicycle too, as well as its three eccentrics belonging to the points \u03b8, \u03bd, \u03bf, will be shifted from their positions by the amount \u03b1\u03b3, and a perfect equivalence will result.","396":"I shall forego further explanation, lest the reader become too confused, for this has really only been mentioned for smatterers or curiosity seekers.","397":"Tychonic Form11","398":"In the Tychonic form, there is no need of any new delineation.","399":"A very brief sketch is sufficient.","400":"The eccentric's point of attachment is set at the four different positions \u03bb, \u03c1, \u03c3, \u03c5, so the planet is at \u03b9, \u03ba, \u03bb, \u03bc, and \u03b9\u03bb, \u03ba\u03b1\u03c1, \u03bb\u03c3, \u03bc\u03c5, and \u03b8\u03b1 parallel.","401":"Now Tycho himself made the center of the circle of Mars carry the double epicycle, and said that it goes around a uniformly on a circle concentric with the sun: for this idea he was indebted to Ptolemy.","402":"And in this matter, he, along with Ptolemy and Copernicus, was strongly urged by me (in Ch.","403":"6 of Part I) to seek that point of attachment, whether it is the center of the concentric or of an eccentric, in the center of the solar body, this being supported by physical arguments and by the demonstration of its geometrical possibility.","404":"Additional support is provided by the valid argument of Ch.","405":"22 and 23, that unless this were done, even if the observations were referred to the sun's mean position, the Ptolemaic epicycle and the Brahean deferent would be made eccentric, in directions exactly opposite to the sun's eccentricity.","406":"I have also promised stronger arguments, deduced from Brahe's own observations, for abandoning the sun's concentric, and in Ch.","407":"52 and 57 below I will produce them ^12.","408":"But it has already been proved here in Chapter 26 that this center of Mars's concentric (or the point from which Mars's eccentricity originates) is found, not on an equal eccentric described about the center of the sun's point of uniform motion \u03c4, as Brahe along with the other authorities had believed, but on an eccentric described about \u03be, which is in the middle position between \u03b1 and \u03c4.\nTherefore, if the center of Mars's concentric goes around with the sun, it nevertheless goes around on an eccentric described about \u03be, and consequently the sun itself will go around on an eccentric described about \u03be. But its motion is uniform about \u03c4. Therefore, the sun's eccentricity \u03b1\u03c4 must be bisected at \u03be. For it is not likely that, although the centers of the concentrics of Mars and the sun go around in the same way, reach apogee at the same time, transpose their apogees in the same way, go slowly or quickly in the same way, and describe the same circumferences, their circles would nevertheless make different digressions from the earth in the same direction.","409":"Let it be enough for now, to present this form of demonstration in the three hypotheses.","410":"In what follows, whenever there is need of the same demonstration, I shall use Copernicus's form alone, it being simpler, so as not to be too long-winded.","411":"Now, in contrast, the industrious reader has seen how any of  these diagrams can be transformed into either the Ptolemaic or the Copernican form using parallel lines.","412":"Chapter 27","413":"From four other observations of the star Mars outside the acronychal situation but still in the same eccentric position, to demonstrate the eccentricity of the earth's orb, with its aphelion and the ratio of the orbs at that place, together with the eccentric position of Mars on the zodiac.","414":"Hitherto we have almost exclusively used the aphelion of Mars, along with the correction of the mean motion and the hypothesis of the equations found above.","415":"If these should err by a single minute in defining the planet's zodiacal longitude, as can easily happen, this creates considerable difficulty for us in the present undertaking.","416":"So now, at this point, we shall take for granted nothing whatever except Mars's periodic time, concerning which there can be no doubt, and the sun's zodiacal positions from Tycho's calculation.","417":"We shall also, I grant, assume an eccentric position, as is the common procedure in demonstrations leading to an impossibility, but we shall test that very position using repeated suppositions.","418":"These are the observations.","419":"Since in 1589 there is but a single day that can be related to the others, and nothing else was observed for a long time before and after, let us refer the other times to this one.","420":"The catalog of them, along with the apparent positions of the sun and Mars, and with the eccentric position of Mars, is this: 1","421":"Let the diagram be made as before, with \u03b1 the sun, \u03b2 the center of the earth's eccentric, \u03b6, \u03b4, \u03b5, \u03b3 the four positions of the earth, \u03b7 the position of Mars on its eccentric, and let each point be connected with all the others.","422":"Now, from the data,","423":"Now because there stand two angles upon the arc \u03b6\u03b5 at the circumference of the circle, namely \u03b6\u03b4\u03b5, \u03b6\u03b3\u03b5, by Euclid III.","424":"21 these must be equal.","425":"And in order that they come out equal, \u03b1\u03b7 must be moved forward and backward above \u03b1 beneath the zodiac as long as [is necessary] ^2.","426":"And since in this first trial the zodiacal position for \u03b1\u03b7 is given, let it therefore be tried whether \u03b6\u03b4\u03b5, \u03b6\u03b3\u03b5 might be equal, for then it will be established that the position of \u03b1\u03b7 is correct.","427":"In the four triangles \u03b6\u03b1\u03b4, \u03b4\u03b1\u03b5, \u03b5\u03b1\u03b3, \u03b6\u03b1\u03b3, the same number of angles is sought, namely \u03b6\u03b4\u03b1, \u03b5\u03b4\u03b1, \u03b5\u03b3\u03b1, \u03b6\u03b3\u03b1 in order to get \u03b5\u03b4\u03b6, \u03b5\u03b3\u03b6.","428":"Now in any of these triangles the angles at \u03b1 are given by the position of the sun from Tycho, and the correction for the precession of the equinoxes.","429":"But the sides comprehending those angles have just been found.","430":"Therefore, the angles, too, will be given.","431":"Since these angles didn't quite come out equal, I made a second trial with \u03b1\u03b7's sidereal position moved forward 2'.","432":"And I found \u03b5\u03b4\u03b6 to be 21\u00b0 40' 9\", \u03b5\u03b3\u03b6 21\u00b0 22' 14\", differing by 18', which is twice the previous discrepancy.","433":"Whence it is understood that \u03b1\u03b7 should have been moved backwards to a lesser longitude, rather than forwards.","434":"For a third trial, then, supposing Mars\u2019s eccentric position in 1585 was 5\u00b0 20' 2\"  Libra, \u03b5\u03b4\u03b6 came out to be 21\u00b0 15' 54\", and \u03b5\u03b3\u03b6 21\u00b0 13' 54\".","435":"There remains a difference of 2\u2019, which we may safely ignore.","436":"Nevertheless, by extrapolating we realize that at this place Mars's eccentric position has to be moved back3 through 2\u00bd\u2019, just as previously in Chapter 22 it was moved forward 1' on the opposite semicircle.","437":"Both of these are brought about by an increase of the eccentricity and a slight retraction of the aphelion.","438":"Let us now proceed to the investigation of the rest.","439":"And because each of the angles in question has decreased, they will decrease further when \u03b1\u03b7 is moved back.","440":"Therefore, let each be 21\u00b0 13', and \u03b6\u03b2\u03b5, the double angle at the center, be 42\u00b0 26'.","441":"Therefore, \u03b6\u03b5\u03b2 is 68\u00b0 47'.","442":"In triangle \u03b6\u03b1\u03b5 angle \u03b6\u03b1\u03b5 is 42\u00b0 6' 57\", and the sides are given by a new correction, so that \u03b1\u03b6 is 62,177 and \u03b1\u03b5 61,525, approximately.","443":"Hence, \u03b6\u03b5\u03b1 is given as 69\u00b0 43' 31\", and \u03b6\u03b5 44,518.","444":"But this same \u03b6\u03b5, from angle \u03b6\u03b2\u03b5 (which \u03b6\u03b5 subtends), is 72,379 where \u03b5\u03b2 is 100,000.","445":"Therefore, where \u03b5\u03b2 is 100,000, \u03b1\u03b7 is 162,818, and thus \u03b1\u03b5 is 100,174.","446":"But when \u03b6\u03b5\u03b2 is subtracted from \u03b6\u03b5\u03b1, the remainder \u03b2\u03b5\u03b1 is 0\u00b0 56' 31\", and \u03b2\u03b1\u03b5 is 83\u00b0 30'.","447":"Therefore, the aphelion is at 10\u00b0 19' Capricorn, while the eccentricity  \u03b1\u03b2 is 1653.","448":"Again we have come rather close to half of 3600, and would doubtless obtain exactly that if we had the apogee perfectly.","449":"Still, it should be noted that if we suppose that the earth's path is not a perfect circle, but is narrower at the sides, \u03b1\u03b7 comes out here to be a little less than 163,100.","450":"And then, with 1\u00bd\u2019 subtracted from the eccentric position, and taking the value 1800 for the earth's eccentricity and 5\u00bd\u00b0 Capricorn as the aphelion, the following apparent positions are produced:","451":"This supposition also agrees with my observations of 1604 February 29\/ March 10, for on the night following that day with my instruments I found Mars culminating at 26\u00b0 18\u2158\u2018 Libra.","452":"And calculation based upon these assumptions puts it at 26\u00b0 17\u00bd\u2019 Libra.","453":"Moreover, at 8\u2154h a few hours before the observation, it was again in the same eccentric position.","454":"Besides, since Mars has some latitude here, the value for \u03b1\u03b7 just found is the distance in the plane of the ecliptic of the point \u03b7 from the center of the sun, to which point a perpendicular is drawn from the body of Mars, as was noted in Chapter 20 above.","455":"So the true distance of the planet's body itself from the center of the sun is made a little longer by 37 units.","456":"Chapter 28","457":"Assuming not only the zodiacal positions of the sun, but also the sun's distances from the earth found using an eccentricity of 1800, through a number of observations of Mars at the same eccentric position, to see whether by unanimous consent the same distance of Mars from the sun, and the same eccentric position, are elicited.","458":"By which argument, it will be confirmed that the solar eccentricity of 1800 is correct, and was property assumed.","459":"The reader should not be surprised that in this third turn I am now not presupposing the eccentric position of Mars as it is given by the hypothesis of acronychal observations found above.","460":"For I have said that that hypothesis was only vicarious, not natural, and thus possesses only as much trustworthiness as is derived from the observations; and it could deviate somewhat in the intermediate positions between observations.","461":"Besides, it helps us to have  at hand various methods of demonstration by which to explore carefully the distances of Mars at all places throughout the entire circle.","462":"Accordingly, a new form of demonstration will follow here.","463":"The observations are these.","464":"When the times of the other observations are adjusted so as to return Mars to the same eccentric position which it had at the last time, we are given the following times.","465":"Along with these are added the requisite positions of the sun, and the distances of the sun and the earth computed from the hypothesis so far established.","466":"And indeed, we have taken up this labor in order to test these very things.","467":"A little later, in Ch.","468":"30, a technique for computing these distances will follow ^1.","469":"Now for the deduction of the observations from the days of the observations to the times we have chosen.","470":"For the first time, the diurnal motion was taken from Magini, since over the space of a few hours there is no danger of error.","471":"The other times are supported by observations before and after.","472":"However, for the penultimate time I also looked up the sequence of diurnal motions in Magini.","473":"Around December 15 the diurnal motion was 30', and around December 5 it was 32'.","474":"For the last time, although Mars, being at an altitude of 23\u00b0, is affected by refraction, so that 2\u2019 might easily be wanting in the latitude, this refraction nevertheless hardly affects the longitude of Mars.","475":"(Tycho claimed that the refraction of the fixed stars, also applicable to the planets, ceases at this altitude, although the solar refraction reaches higher, and at this altitude is about 4\u2019.","476":"This distinction was discussed and demolished in my Optical astronomy p.","477":"137, 2 and would be rendered even more dubious if any changes are to be made in the parallax of the sun.)","478":"Let \u03b1 be the sun's body, \u03b1\u03b2 the eccentricity of the earth's orb (1800), and the line of apsides be at 5\u00bd\u00b0 Cancer, positions of the earth \u03b6, \u03b5, \u03b4, \u03b3, \u03b8, and the body of the planet at the same eccentric position \u03b7 all five times, since the intervals span complete periods of Mars.","479":"And let all points be connected with one another.","480":"It is desired to find \u03b1\u03b7, and its  zodiacal position, that is, angle \u03b7\u03b1\u03b8, \u03b7\u03b1\u03b3, or some other angle at \u03b1. We shall do this from two earth positions in the following manner.","481":"For a start, let these be \u03b5, \u03b4.

For also in the common method of measuring distances of things on earth, the farther the standing points are from one another, the more accurately distance of the mark is obtained.","501":"For the zodiacal position, however, we shall put our trust in the observations at \u03b5, \u03b4, instead.","502":"For if there is some slight error in the length of \u03b1\u03b7, it is presented to the observer at \u03b5, \u03b4 quite obliquely, and the angle does not change perceptibly.","503":"Nor is this to be forgotten: that there is no perceptible lengthening of \u03b1\u03b7 over the seven years from 1583 to 1590, because the pregression of the aphelion is very slow.","504":"Summary: On 1590 October 31 at 6\u00bch in the morning, Mars's eccentric position was 8\u00b0 19' 20\" Virgo, while the hypothesis constructed using acronychal observations places it at 8\u00b0 19' 29\" Virgo.","505":"Its distance was 166,180, which must be lengthened because of the latitude, so that from this distance, the distance from the actual body of Mars to the center of the sun comes out to be about 166,228.","506":"Chapter 29","507":"A Method of Deducing the Distances of the Sun and Earth from the Known Eccentricity","508":"I think it has been well enough confirmed that the distances of the sun and the earth are to be deduced by halving the eccentricity obtained by Tycho.","509":"This  is also abundantly confirmed by observation of the sun's summer and winter diameter, as I have shown in the Astronomiae pars optica chapter 11 ^1.","510":"But it is also wonderfully confirmed in the Mysterium cosmographicum, in the table in ch.","511":"15 p.","512":"53,2 where the equations of the center for Mars, Venus, and Mercury were deficient when the lunar orb was interposed, but excessive when it was omitted.","513":"Now, the orb of the moon being retained while the eccentricity of the sun is bisected, they come out about right.","514":"Furthermore, the same thing will again be confirmed more frequently and much more clearly when we use the distances forthcoming from the bisection (as we have just begun to do in the last chapter) and shall see the phenomena follow from them.","515":"Therefore, in order that these distances be ready at hand for our future use, I shall show how they may easily be computed, using a geometrical demonstration.","516":"On the line \u03b1\u03b4 let \u03b1 be the body of the sun (or the earth for Tycho, or the center of attachment of the epicycle for Ptolemy); \u03b2 the center of the eccentric \u03b6\u03b4\u03b7 of the earth (or of the sun and of the annual orb for Tycho, or of the epicycle for Ptolemy); and \u03b1\u03b2 being extended, let it intersect the eccentric at \u03b4, \u03b5, so that \u03b4 is the aphelion or apogee and \u03b5 the perihelion or perigee; and let \u03b2\u03b3 be equal to \u03b1\u03b2.","517":"Also, let \u03b3 be the center of motion or of uniformity, at which the earth (for Ptolemy, the center of the epicycle, for Tycho the sun and the point of attachment of all the eccentrics) sets out equal angles in equal times.","518":"And let \u03b1\u03b3 be 3600, from the observations of Tycho and the Landgrave,3 but \u03b1\u03b2, according to my recently introduced adjustment, be 1800.","519":"Now let \u03b6\u03b7 be drawn through \u03b1 perpendicular to \u03b4\u03b5, intersecting the circle at \u03b6, \u03b7, and also through \u03b1 let the straight line \u03b8\u03b9 be drawn, at any inclination whatever, intersecting the circumference at \u03b8, \u03b9; and let the four points \u03b8, \u03b9, \u03b6, \u03b7 be connected with the center \u03b2.

Now, by the equivalence shown in the second chapter (which, for the sake of avoiding confusion, I shall not apply to the general Ptolemaic hypothesis), this is exactly as if one were to say that the earth (or sun) is moved nonuniformly on a concentric with an epicycle4 about center \u03b1, the semidiameter of the epicycle being equal to \u03b1\u03b2; and the arcs described on the concentric by the center of the epicycle being similar to the arcs of the epicycle described by the earth (or sun), so that both the earth (or sun) and the center of the epicycle are moved unequally in equal times, so as to become slow, or again speed up, simultaneously.","520":"I am going to postpone for a little while the physical explanation of this hypothesis.","521":"Now, with these things supposed, I shall proceed to the work of finding  the distances.","522":"And because \u03b2\u03b4 is 100,000 and \u03b2\u03b1 1800, and \u03b1\u03b2\u03b4 is a straight line, by addition of the two the aphelial distance \u03b1\u03b4 is obtained; and because \u03b2\u03b5 too is 100,000, when \u03b1\u03b2 is subtracted the perihelial distance \u03b1\u03b5 remains.","523":"And because \u03b2\u03b1\u03b6 is right, and \u03b6\u03b2 is 100,000 (that is, the whole sine), therefore \u03b1\u03b2 is the sine of the angle \u03b1\u03b6\u03b2.","524":"Consequently \u03b1\u03b6\u03b2 is 1\u00b0 1' 53\", which is the optical part of the equation of the sun or earth.","525":"Now the maximum equation at the  middle elongations, which is composed of the optical and physical parts, has the whole eccentricity 3600 (or 3592) as its sine.","526":"Therefore, when the sun or earth goes from \u03b4 to \u03b6, it will in fact take two days longer than one fourth of the periodic time, but it nevertheless does only one day's journey beyond one fourth of its total circuit.","527":"So in this distance, or quarter of the periodic time,5 it will take one day longer than it should, owing to the physical weakening.","528":"But to proceed to the distance \u03b1\u03b6.","529":"In the right triangle \u03b6\u03b1\u03b2, since one of the acute angles is given, the other, \u03b6\u03b2\u03b1, will be the difference between the first and one right angle, that is, 88\u00b0 58' 7\".","530":"And therefore \u03b1\u03b6 will be the sine of this angle, 99984.","531":"And the opposite line \u03b1\u03b7 is the same size.","532":"For finding the intermediate distances of two opposite degrees of equated anomaly, let \u03b8\u03b9 be inspected, passing through the body \u03b1 whence the eccentricity is computed.","533":"Now \u03b4\u03b1\u03b8 and \u03b4\u03b1\u03b9 are equated anomalies, and are opposite, in that \u03b1 is between them and is collinear with them.","534":"Now let a line \u03b2\u03ba fall from \u03b2 perpendicular to \u03b8\u03b9, so as to make \u03b8\u03ba, \u03ba\u03b9 equal.","535":"In the right triangle \u03b2\u03ba\u03b1 the base \u03b2\u03b1 is given, as well as the angles \u03ba\u03b1\u03b2 (from the integral number of degrees of equated anomaly chosen) and its complement \u03ba\u03b2\u03b1.","536":"Therefore, the sides \u03ba\u03b1, \u03ba\u03b2 will not be unknown.","537":"And \u03ba\u03b2 is the sine of the angle \u03ba\u03b8\u03b2 or \u03ba\u03b9\u03b2.","538":"This being given, its complement, \u03b8\u03b2\u03ba or \u03b9\u03b2\u03ba, will also be known, and its sine, which is the line \u03b8\u03ba or \u03ba\u03b9.","539":"And when \u03ba\u03b1 is added to \u03ba\u03b8, \u03b1\u03b8 is obtained; and when the same is subtracted from \u03ba\u03b9, \u03b1\u03b9 is obtained.","540":"The former distance corresponds to the equated anomaly \u03b4\u03b1\u03b8, and the latter to the equated anomaly \u03b4\u03b1\u03b9, which line has a line equal to itself in the preceding semicircle, standing as far from aphelion in semicircle \u03b4\u03b8 as \u03b1\u03b9 itself does in semicircle \u03b4\u03b7.","541":"Now through \u03b1 let the straight line \u03bc\u03bd be drawn intersecting the circle in \u03bc, \u03bd, and making the angle \u03bc\u03b1\u03b4 equal to the angle \u03ba\u03b2\u03b1.","542":"And from \u03b2 let \u03b2\u03bb fall perpendicular to \u03bc\u03bd bisecting \u03bc\u03bd at \u03bb.

Which was to","567":"be demonstrated.","568":"Everything said in this chapter about the computing of distances of the sun and earth will also be valid for Mars, as long as one of the suppositions is that the orbits of planets are perfect circles.","569":"When this is seen as false, another method of computing them will be given.","570":"Chapter 30","571":"Table of the distance of the sun from the earth and its use","572":"We have gathered together here into a three-columned table the distances of the sun accumulated in this way [that is, in the way described in ch.","573":"29], as if they were done for integral degrees of equated anomaly for the whole semicircle (for those in the other semicircle at equal distances from apogee are also equal to these).","574":"In the first column, which we have called \"mean anomaly\", are the angles \u03b4\u03b2\u03bc, \u03b4\u03b2\u03b8, \u03b4\u03b2\u03be, \u03b4\u03b2\u03b9, \u03b4\u03b2\u03bd, composed of the integral angles \u03b4\u03b1\u03bc, \u03b4\u03b1\u03b8, \u03b4\u03b1\u03be, \u03b4\u03b1\u03b9, \u03b4\u03b1\u03bd, and their optical or eccentric equations, namely, \u03b2\u03bc\u03b1, \u03b2\u03b8\u03b1, \u03b2\u03be\u03b1, \u03b2\u03b9\u03b1, \u03b2\u03bd\u03b1.","575":"In the second, the distances themselves, \u03b1\u03bc, \u03b1\u03b8, \u03b1\u03be, \u03b1\u03b9, \u03b1\u03bd, are placed together opposite [the mean anomalies].","576":"In the third, under the heading \"equated anomaly,\" are tabulated angles not depicted here, but the  procedure for whose generation will be revealed in part here and in part in Chapters 31 and 40.","577":"For they are constituted by subtraction of the optical equations \u03b1\u03bc\u03b2 and so forth from \u03b4\u03b1\u03bc and so forth.","578":"Thus we have given no column to the integral angles like \u03b4\u03b1\u03bc, because they are the arithmetic mean between the angles of the columns at the sides, and thus are easily found in themselves, and are not of any use, as we shall hear.","579":"Therefore, beginning with either the mean or the equated anomaly, either  one going into its proper respective column as use will dictate; or, where it exceeds a semicircle, beginning with the full-circle complement of either of these; you find the requisite distance of the sun from the earth, in units of which the radius of the orb is 100,000 and the eccentricity is 1800.","580":"It is true that in this way (that is, in associating the distance \u03b1\u03b6 of the angle  \u03b4\u03b1\u03b6 with an angle which is as much smaller than \u03b4\u03b1\u03b6 as \u03b4\u03b1\u03b6 is smaller than \u03b4\u03b2\u03b6) a path is attached to the circuit of the earth (or sun) about \u03b1 which is oval rather than exactly circular.","581":"For the distance \u03b1\u03b6 (for example) was determined by the angle \u03b4\u03b1\u03b6, an integral 90\u00b0, and it was assumed in the operation that this angle \u03b4\u03b1\u03b6 was the equated anomaly.","582":"Now, however, you are told to get the distances using the angles of the anomaly that is called \"equated\" in our table, which have been diminished by the equation \u03b2\u03b6\u03b1.","583":"It thus happens that at 90\u00b0 you do not get 99,984, although you would previously have determined it to be 99,984.","584":"For here, opposite 99,984, you find an equated anomaly of 88\u00b0 58' 7\", which is not your value.","585":"For it was 90\u00b0 that was proposed, which, standing farther down, shows [a distance of] 99,953, while, according to the law of the circle, \u03b1\u03b6 or \u03b1\u03b7 should be 99,984.","586":"So all the distances are diminished at the sides, most greatly about \u03b6, \u03b7, none at \u03b4, \u03b5. Clearly, an oval is thus substituted for the circular path.","587":"You will obtain the same result if you begin with a mean anomaly obtained from whatever source.","588":"For when the diagram was set out above, the mean anomaly denoted angles about \u03b3. But now you will begin with angles about \u03b2, smaller than the optical equation about \u03b3. And 91\u00b0 1' 53\" of mean anomaly shows you a distance of 99,984.","589":"But that was the magnitude of \u03b4\u03b2\u03b6 above.","590":"Nor was the mean anomaly there, for it was \u03b4\u03b3\u03b6, which is still greater.","591":"So the former mean anomaly of 91\u00b0 1\u2019 53\" had generated a longer distance there than a mean anomaly of the same magnitude, 91\u00b0 1\u2019 53\", shows here.","592":"All this, I say, is true.","593":"But there is no reason why you should be brought up short.","594":"For since we are considering differences of one degree, you see that the distances within one degree vary no more than 31 parts in one hundred thousand.","595":"Therefore, there would be no perceptible error, even if what has been done were to be out of the proper order.","596":"Below, in Ch.","597":"44 and the following, by analogy with the rest of the planets, you will find the reason for adapting this arrangement to the theory of the sun as well.","598":"Therefore, this is not out of order, but perfectly correct, because it concerns the qualitative nature of the figure that the planet describes, which has been substituted.","599":"As regards the quantity of the figure, the cure is excessive.","600":"The equated anomaly of 88\u00b0 58\u2019 7\", to which corresponds a mean anomaly of 91\u00b0 1' 53\", ought not to show a value of 99,984, but 100,000, which is the mean between the distances of the figure and of the table.","601":"The reason for this assertion must be postponed until Ch.","602":"55 and the following.","603":"It was just said, however, that we shall not err perceptibly if we err by 31 units.","604":"It will therefore hurt us much less perceptibly if we err by only half that, or 16 units.","605":"So for the time being we safely admit this small error, in order to accommodate ourselves to an understanding of what has been advanced in the reading so far, and to avoid appearing to presuppose what was to be demonstrated.","606":"Chapter 31","607":"That the bisection of the sun's eccentricity does not perceptibly alter the equations of the sun set out by Tycho; and concerning four ways of computing them.","608":"But lest there remain any suspicions preventing our moving onwards, we shall investigate, in the usual Ptolemaic form of the first inequality,*  whether there be any difference in the solar equations consequent upon the now bisected eccentricity.","609":"First let there be an unbisected eccentricity of 3600 on the line of apsides AF, with CE and CD accordingly radii of the orb; and let the anomaly FAE be 45\u00b0, and FAD 135\u00b0.","610":"Now it is obvious that, however great the discrepancy may be, it will reach its maximum around these positions of anomaly.","611":"For in the middle elongations the equations come out exactly the same, since [an eccentricity of] 3600, when investigated in both the sines and tangents","612":"1 produces the same arc.","613":"Therefore, as the radius CE is to the sine of the angle CAE or CAD, so is the eccentricity CA to the equation CEA or CDA, which are both 1\u00b0 27' 31\".","614":"And in this first way, Ptolemy computed the equations of the sun, and, following Ptolemy, Copernicus; and, following both, Brahe: each of them using only the eccentricity AC, whose magnitude they found through their observations.","615":"There now follows a second way of computing the same equations, of which Ptolemy made use in the other planets, and of which I should make use.","616":"For I have demonstrated in this third part that the center of the eccentric is not at the point C, the center of uniform motion, but at B, the midpoint between the center of the world A and the point of uniformity C.","617":"Therefore let CA be bisected at B, and let EB, BD, be the radius of the orb.","618":"By the same method, the part of the equation BDA, BEA, will be 0\u00b0 43' 46\", which, added to EAB, DAB, will result in an angle EBC of 45\u00b0 43' 46\", and DBC, of 135\u00b0 43' 46\".","619":"As a result, from the sides and the included angle, BEC comes out to be 43' 38\", and BDC 43' 42\".","620":"Thus the whole angle CEA is 1\u00b0 27' 24\", and CDA is 1\u00b0 27' 28\", within a hair's breadth of the previous value.","621":"And so, in the appendix to Tycho Brahe's Progymnasmata p.","622":"821, where the difference of the two calculations is given as 1\u2159\u2019, you should read \u2159\u20192.","623":"And this is in accord with the conclusions of Ch.","624":"4 applied to the form of the vicarious hypothesis.","625":"And since you may observe that in this particular form of Ptolemaic hy","626":"pothesis the parts of the equation are nearly equal (for the optical part was 43' 46\" and the physical part was 43' 38\" at E and 43' 42\" at D), you see why, in the construction of the table in the preceding chapter, all I did was double the equation to establish the total equation.","627":"And this is the third way of computing the sun's equations.","628":"For at apogee and perigee both parts of the equation vanish, and in the middle elongations the parts are again equal, as was just now said.","629":"Therefore, since these three ways of computing the equations clearly coincide in eight places distributed about the entire circle, they will perceptibly coincide everywhere.","630":"This is a result of the smallness of the eccentricity: if it","631":"were greater, this coincidence would not take place everywhere.","632":"Now I shall prepare myself for finding yet a fourth way to the equation,","633":"to be computed not through an arbitrary hypothesis but from the very nature of things, in eight chapters.","634":"Accordingly, this fourth way can finally follow in Chapter 40.","635":"Chapter 32","636":"The power that moves the planet in a circle diminishes with removal from its source.","637":"I have said above that Ptolemy, well informed by the observations, bisected the eccentricities of the three superior planets, that Copernicus imitated this, and that Tycho's observations of Mars also urge the same conclusion, as has been seen in Chapters 19 and 20, and will appear with much greater certainty below in Chapter 42.","638":"In addition, Tycho closely imitated this in his lunar theory.","639":"And now the same thing has been demonstrated in the theory of the sun (for Tycho) or of the earth (for Copernicus).","640":"Further, there is nothing to prevent our believing the same of Venus and Mercury.","641":"Indeed, I now take it as proven that this is the origin of the belief that the centers of these planets' eccentrics move around on a small annual circle.","642":"Therefore all planets have this [double eccentricity].","643":"Now in my Mysterium cosmographicum, published eight years ago,*  I postponed arguing this case of the cause of the Ptolemaic equant for the sole reason that it could not be said on the basis of ordinary astronomy whether the sun or earth uses an equalizing point and has its eccentricity bisected.","644":"However, now that we have the confirmation of a sounder astronomy, it should be transparently clear that there is indeed an equant in the theory of the sun or earth.","645":"And, I say, now that this is demonstrated, it is proper to accept as true and legitimate the cause to which I assigned the Ptolemaic equant in the Mysterium cosmographicum, since it is universal and common to all the planets.","646":"So in this part of the work I shall make a further declaration of that cause.","647":"And since the declaration will be general, I shall use the word, \"planet\".","648":"However, in this and the next few chapters, the reader may always understand by this, in particular, the earth for Copernicus or the sun for Tycho.","649":"First, the reader should know that in every hypothesis constructed according to this Ptolemaic form, however great the eccentricity, the speed at perihelion and slowness at aphelion are very closely proportional to the lines drawn from the center of the world to the planet.","650":"In the diagram of Chapter 29, in which \u03b1 was the center of the world, \u03b2 was the center of the eccentric \u03b4\u03b5, and \u03b3 was the point of the equant, let the equant circle \u03c5\u03c6 be described about center \u03b3, with radius equal to \u03b2\u03b4.","651":"And through the center of the world \u03b1, from which the eccentricity is reckoned (and in the business at hand, it is the sun for Copernicus and the earth for the others), let the straight line \u03c8\u03c9 be drawn, intersecting the eccentric at \u03c8 and \u03c9, so that the planet is at \u03c8 and \u03c9, having traversed the arcs of the eccentric \u03b4\u03c8 and \u03b5\u03c9, from apogee or aphelion and from perigee  or perihelion, respectively.","652":"It is supposed that these arcs appear equal from \u03b1, since the straight line \u03c8\u03c9 makes the vertical angles \u03c8\u03b1\u03b4 and \u03c9\u03b1\u03b5, which are equal.","653":"But since \u03b4\u03c8 and \u03b5\u03c9 are taken as minimal arcs, as if at the apsides \u03b4 and \u03b5, they do not differ perceptibly from straight lines.","654":"And so, just as \u03b4\u03b1\u03c8 and \u03b5\u03b1\u03c9 were rectilinear triangles, with right angles at \u03b4 and \u03b5, and a common vertex \u03b1, \u03b4\u03b1 will be to \u03b5\u03b1 as arc \u03b4\u03c8 is to arc \u03b5\u03c9.","655":"But \u03b1\u03b4 is longer than \u03b1\u03b5.","656":"Therefore, arc \u03b4\u03c8 is longer than \u03b5\u03c9.","657":"These arcs, which are in fact unequal, appear equal from \u03b1. The question now is, how much time will the planet take to traverse each arc, according to Ptolemy's theory and hypothesis, when it has an equant?","658":"So let straight lines be drawn from the center \u03b3 through the points \u03c8 and \u03c9, intersecting the equant at \u03c7, \u03c4. Now Ptolemy will say, \"since the whole circle of the equant \u03c5\u03c6 denotes the periodic time of the planet, then \u03c5\u03c7 is the measure of the time which the planet takes to traverse the arc of the eccentric \u03c8\u03b4, and \u03c6\u03c4 is the measure of the time which the planet takes to traverse the arc of the eccentric \u03b5\u03c9.\"","659":"And now I myself say that \u03c5\u03c7, thus designated as the arc of the time (as Ptolemy wished) is to the arc \u03b4\u03c8 which the planet traverses, very nearly as \u03b1\u03b4, the distance of the arc \u03b4\u03c8 from the center of the world, is to \u03b4\u03b2 the mean distance of the points \u03c0 and \u03c1 from \u03b1. And likewise, the arc of the time \u03c6\u03c4 is to the arc of the planet's motion \u03b5\u03c9, approximately as \u03b1\u03b5, the distance of the arc \u03b5\u03c9 from the center of the world \u03b1 is to \u03b5\u03b2 and \u03b1\u03c0, the mean distance from the center of the world, which may be found at the points \u03c0 and \u03c1. And now, as before, as \u03b3\u03c5 is to \u03b3\u03b4 so is \u03c5\u03c7 to \u03b4\u03c8, and as \u03b3\u03c6 is to \u03b3\u03b5 so is \u03c6\u03c4 to \u03b5\u03c9.","660":"But \u03b3\u03c5 is to \u03b3\u03b4 very nearly as \u03b2\u03b4 (or \u03b3\u03c5) is to \u03b1\u03b4, and this is shown by the fact that \u03b2\u03b4 is the arithmetic mean between \u03b3\u03b4 and \u03b1\u03b4, since Ptolemy makes \u03b1\u03b2, \u03b2\u03b3 equal.","661":"And further, the arithmetic mean between two terms whose ratio is near equality is only imperceptibly greater than the geometric mean.","662":"For example, the arithmetic mean between 10 and 12 is 11, and the geometric mean is about 1019\/20, so that there is less than the twentieth part of a unit between the two means.","663":"Nevertheless, these numbers are of the order of the eccentricity of Mars, which according to Ptolemy has the greatest eccentricity of all the planets.","664":"And therefore, since the ratio \u03b3\u03c5 to \u03b3\u03b4 is imperceptibly greater than the ratio \u03b1\u03b4 to \u03b4\u03b2, \u03c7\u03c5 will also have to \u03c8\u03b4 a ratio imperceptibly greater than \u03b1\u03b4 to \u03b4\u03b2.","665":"Likewise, as \u03b3\u03b5 is to \u03b3\u03c6, so is \u03b5\u03c9 to \u03c6\u03c4, but \u03b3\u03b5 is to \u03b3\u03c6 approximately as \u03b5\u03b2 is to \u03b1\u03b5; that is, the former ratio is only imperceptibly less than the latter.","666":"Therefore, too, the ratio \u03b5\u03c9 to \u03c6\u03c4 is only imperceptibly smaller than the ratio \u03b5\u03b2 to \u03b1\u03b5.","667":"Now let us permute the ratios.","668":"For the ratio \u03b1\u03b4 to \u03b4\u03b2 is imperceptibly less than the ratio \u03b4\u03b2 or \u03b2\u03b5 to \u03b5\u03b1, seeing that \u03b2\u03b4 or \u03b2\u03b5 is the arithmetic mean between \u03b1\u03b4 and \u03b1\u03b5, as before.","669":"But it was proved that the ratio \u03c5\u03c7 to \u03b4\u03c8 is greater than the ratio \u03b1\u03b4 to \u03b4\u03b2, from the smaller pair, and the ratio \u03b5\u03c9 to \u03c6\u03c4 is less than the ratio \u03b5\u03b2 to \u03b1\u03b5,  from the greater pair, so that in the two ratios \u03b1\u03b4 to \u03b4\u03b2 and \u03b5\u03b2 to \u03b1\u03b5, the amount by which the former terms will be greater and the latter smaller is, in the two ratios \u03c5\u03c7 to \u03b4\u03c8 and \u03b5\u03c9 to \u03c6\u03c4, the same as the amount by which the former is greater and the latter smaller.","670":"Consequently, there is some compensation even for that imperceptible difference, so that it is much more nearly true that the ratio of \u03c5\u03c7 to \u03b4\u03c8 is equal within a hair's breadth to the ratio of \u03b5\u03c9 to \u03c6\u03c4.","671":"Therefore, the arcs \u03b4\u03c8 and \u03b5\u03c9 being taken as equal (which hitherto were unequal), either \u03b4\u03c8 or \u03b5\u03c9 will be a mean proportional between \u03c5\u03c7, the increment of time at aphelion, and \u03c6\u03c4, the increment of time at perihelion.","672":"Consequently, the ratio \u03c5\u03c7 to \u03c6\u03c4 (\u03b4\u03c8 and \u03b5\u03c9 being equal) will be in the duplicate ratio of \u03b1\u03b4 to \u03b4\u03b2 or \u03b2\u03b5 to \u03b5\u03b1, the former smaller and the latter greater by an imperceptible difference.","673":"But since the ratio \u03b1\u03b4 to \u03b1\u03b5 is also the duplicate of either of these (for it is compounded of the two, which are nearly equal, taking the arithmetic mean \u03b4\u03b2 or \u03b2\u03b5), therefore, the arcs on the eccentric \u03b4\u03c8 and \u03b5\u03c9 being equal, the ratio of the times \u03c5\u03c7 to \u03c6\u03c4 will be equal to the ratio \u03b1\u03b4 to \u03b1\u03b5.","674":"Or, more clearly, the planet takes a proportionally longer time to traverse some particular eccentric arc at \u03b4 than to traverse an equal eccentric arc at \u03b5, according as \u03b1\u03b4 is greater than \u03b1\u03b5.","675":"And this follows from the way the Ptolemaic form*  is ordered, and from its equalizing point, by means of a proof that is certain and valid so far as it concerns points near apogee and perigee.","676":"At other points there appears a very small discrepancy, which is all the smaller in effect the more obvious it is in the demonstration.","677":"This is because (for example) the ratio \u03b1\u03bc to \u03b1\u03bd is smaller, and the ratio \u03b1\u03b8 to \u03b1\u03b9 is much smaller, than \u03b1\u03b4 to \u03b1\u03b5, the greatest ratio, where the effect is also greatest.","678":"Chapter 33","679":"The power that moves the planets resides in the body of the sun","680":"It was demonstrated in the previous chapter that the increments of time of a planet on equal parts of the eccentric circle (or on equal distances in the aethereal air) are in the same ratio to each other as the distances of those same spaces from the point whence the eccentricity is reckoned; or, more simply, to the extent that a planet is farther from the point that is taken as the center of the world, it is less strongly urged to move about that point.","681":"It is therefore necessary that the cause of this weakening is either in the very body of the planet, and in a motive force placed therein, or right at the supposed center of the world.","682":"Now it is an axiom of the most common application in all of natural philosophy that of those things which occur at the same time and in the same manner, and which are always subject to like measurements, either one is the cause of the other or both are effects of the same cause.","683":"Just so, in this instance, the intension and remission of motion is always in the same ratio as the approach and recession from the center of the world.","684":"Thus, either that weakening will be the cause of the star's motion away from the center of the world, or the motion away will be the cause of the weakening, or both will  have some cause in common.","685":"But no one can think up some third concurrent thing that would be the common cause of these two, and in the following chapters it will become clear that we have no need of feigning any such cause, since the two are sufficient in themselves.","686":"Further, it is not in accord with nature that strength or weakness in longitudinal motion should be the cause of distance from the center.","687":"For distance from the center is prior both in thought and in nature to longitudinal motion.","688":"Indeed, longitudinal motion is never independent of distance from the center, since it requires a space in which to be performed, while distance from the center can be conceived without motion.","689":"Therefore, distance will be the cause of intensity of motion, and a greater or lesser distance will result in a greater or lesser amount of time.","690":"And since distance belongs to the class of related things, whose being depends upon end points, while relation itself, without respect to end points, has no efficacy, it therefore follows (as has been said) that the cause of the variation of intensity of motion inheres in one or the other of the end points.","691":"Now the body of a planet is never by itself made heavier in receding, nor lighter in approaching.","692":"Moreover, that an animate force, which is seated in the mobile body of the planet and imparts a motion to the heavenly body, undergoes intension and remission so many times without ever becoming tired or growing old,\u2014this will surely be absurd to say.","693":"Also, it is impossible to understand how this animate force could carry its body through the spaces of the world, since there are no solid orbs, as Tycho Brahe has proved.","694":"And on the other hand, a round body lacks such aids as wings or feet, by the moving of which the soul might carry its body through the aethereal air as birds do in the atmosphere, by some kind of pressure upon, and counter-pressure from, that air ^1.","695":"Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the cause of this weakening and intension resides in the other endpoint, namely, in that point that is taken to be the center of the world, from which the distances are measured.","696":"So now, if the distance of the center of the world from the body of a planet  governs its slowness, and approach governs its speeding up, it is a necessary consequence that the source of motive power is at that supposed center of the world.","697":"And with this laid down, the manner in which the cause operates will also be clear.","698":"For it gives us to understand that the planets are moved rather in the manner of the steelyard or lever.","699":"For if the planet is moved with greater difficulty (and hence more slowly) by the power at the center when it is farther from the center, it is just as if I were to say that where the weight is farther from the fulcrum, it is thereby rendered heavier, not of itself, but by the power of the arm supporting it at that distance.","700":"And this is true, both of the steelyard or lever, and of the motion of the planets: that the weakening of power is in the ratio of the distances.","701":"But which body is it that is at the center?","702":"Is there none, as for Copernicus  when he is computing, and for Tycho in part?","703":"Is it the earth, as for Ptolemy and for Tycho in part?","704":"Or finally, is it the sun itself, as I, and Copernicus when he is speculating, would have it?","705":"This question I began to discuss in physical terms in Part 1.","706":"I there supposed as one of the principles what has now been expressly and geometrically proved in Chapter 32: that a planet is  moved less vigorously when it recedes from the point whence the eccentricity is computed.","707":"From this principle I presented a probable argument that the sun, rather than being at some other point occupied by no body, is at that point and at the center of the world (or the earth for Ptolemy).","708":"Allow me, then, to repeat that same probable argument, our foundation [for it] now demonstrated, in the present chapter.","709":"Then, you may remember, I demonstrated in the second part, that the phenomena at either end of the night follow beautifully if we reckon the oppositions of Mars according to the sun's apparent position.","710":"If this is done, then at the same time we set up the eccentricity and the distances from the very center of the sun's body, with the result that the sun itself again comes to be at the center of the world (for Copernicus), or at least at the center of the planetary system (for Tycho).","711":"But of these two arguments, one depends upon physical probability, and the other proceeds from possibility to actuality.","712":"And so in the third place I have postponed, because of its conceptual difficulty, demonstrating from the observations that we cannot avoid referring Mars to the apparent position of the sun, and drawing the line of apsides, which bisects the eccentric, directly through the sun's body, unless perhaps we wish to allow an eccentric such as will by no means be in accord with the parallax of the annual orb.","713":"Anyone who cannot tolerate the delay may read about this in chapter 52, and then may carry on here afterwards.","714":"For there nothing is assumed but the bare observations.","715":"You will find a similar proof in Part 5, from considerations of latitudes.","716":"Therefore, with the sun belonging in the center of the system, the source of motive power, from what has now been demonstrated, belongs in the sun, since it too has now been found to be in the center of the world.","717":"But indeed, if this very thing which I have just demonstrated a posteriori (from the observations) by a rather long deduction, if, I say, I had taken this as something to be demonstrated a priori (from the worthiness and eminence of the sun), so that the source of the world's life (which is visible in the motion of the heavens) is the same as the source of the light which forms the adornment of the entire machine, and which is also the source of the heat by which everything grows, I think I would have deserved an equal hearing.","718":"Let Tycho Brahe himself, or anyone who prefers to follow his general hypothesis of the second inequality, consider by how close a likeness to the truth this physically elegant combination has for the most part been accepted (since for him, too, this substitution of the apparent position of the sun brings the sun back to the center of the planetary system) yet to some extent recoils from his hypothesis.","719":"For it is obvious from what has been said that only one of the following can be true: either the power residing in the sun, which moves all the planets, by the same action moves the earth as well; or the sun, together with the planets linked to it through its motive force, is borne about the earth by some power which is seated in the earth.","720":"Now Tycho himself destroyed the notion of real orbs, and I in turn have in this Third Part irrefutably demonstrated that there is an equant in the theory of the sun or earth.","721":"From this it follows that the motion of the sun itself (if it is moved) is intensified and remitted according as it is nearer or farther from the earth, and hence it would follow that the sun is moved by the earth.","722":"But if, on the other hand, the earth is in motion, it too will be moved by the sun  with greater or less velocity according as it is nearer or farther from it, while the power in the body of the sun remains perpetually constant.","723":"Between these two possibilities, therefore, there is no intermediate.","724":"I myself agree with Copernicus, and allow that the earth is one of the  planets.","725":"Now it is true that the same objection may be raised against Copernicus concerning the moon, that I raised against Tycho concerning the five planets; namely, that it appears absurd for the moon to be moved by the earth, and to be associated with it and bound to it as well, so that it too, as a secondary planet, is swept around the sun by the sun.","726":"Nevertheless, I prefer to allow one moon, akin to the earth in its corporeal disposition2 (as I have shown in the Optics3) to be moved by a power seated in the earth but extended towards the sun, as will be described a little later in Ch.","727":"37, than to ascribe to that same earth as well the motion of the sun and of all the planets bound to it.","728":"But let us carry on in our consideration of this motive power residing in  the sun, and let us now again observe its very close kinship with light.}","729":"Since the perimeters of similar regular figures, even of circles, are to one another as their semidiameters, therefore as \u03b1\u03b4 is to \u03b1\u03b5, so is the circumference of the circle described about \u03b1 through \u03b4 to the circumference of the circle described about the same point \u03b1 through \u03b5. But as \u03b1\u03b4 is to \u03b1\u03b5, so is the strength of the power at \u03b5 to the strength of the power at \u03b4, inversely, by what was proved in Chapter 32.","730":"Therefore, as the circle at \u03b4 is to the smaller circle at \u03b5, so, inversely, is the power at \u03b5 to the power at \u03b4; that is, the power is weaker to the extent that it is more spread out, and stronger to the extent that it is more concentrated.","731":"Hence we understand that there is the same power in the whole circumference of the circle through \u03b4 as there is in the circumference of the smaller circle through \u03b5. This was shown to be true of light in exactly the same way in the Astronomiae pars optica, Chapter 1 ^4.","732":"Therefore, in all respects and in all its attributes, the motive power from the sun coincides with light.","733":"And although this light of the sun cannot be the moving power itself, I leave it to others to see whether light perhaps is equivalent to a kind of instrument or vehicle, of which the moving power makes use.","734":"This seems gainsaid by the following: first, light is hindered by opaque things, and therefore if the moving power had light as a vehicle, rest of the moving bodies would follow upon darkness; again, light spreads spherically in straight lines, while the moving power, though spreading in straight lines, does so circularly; that is, it is exerted in but one region of the world, from east  to west, and not the opposite, not at the poles, and so on.","735":"But we shall perhaps be able to reply to these objections in the chapters immediately following.","736":"Finally, since there is just as much power in a larger and more distant circle as there is in a smaller and closer one, nothing of this power is lost in travelling from its source, nothing is scattered between the source and the movable body.","737":"The emission, then, in the same manner as light, is immaterial, unlike odours, which are accompanied by a diminution of substance, and unlike heat from a hot furnace, or anything similar which fills the intervening space.","738":"The remaining possibility, then, is that, just as light, which lights the whole earth, is an immaterial species5 of that fire which is in the body of the sun, so this power which enfolds and bears the bodies of the planets, is an immaterial species residing in the sun itself, possessing inestimable strength, seeing that it is the primary activity of every motion in the universe.","739":"Since, therefore, this species of the power, exactly as the species of light (for which see the Astronomiae pars optica Ch.","740":"16), cannot be considered as dispersed throughout the intermediate space between the source and the mobile body, but is seen as collected in the body in proportion to the amount of the circumference the mobile body occupies, this power (or species) will therefore not be any geometrical body, but is like a variety of surface, just as light is.","741":"To generalize this, the species of things that emanate immaterially are not by that emanation extended through the dimensions of a body, although they arise from a body (as this one does from the body of the sun).","742":"Instead, they are extended according to that very law of emission: they are not bounded by the emanation itself, but just as the surfaces of things to be illuminated cause light to be considered as a kind of surface, because they receive and terminate its emission, so the bodies of things that are moved appear to bring it about that this moving power be considered as if a sort of geometrical body, because their whole masses terminate or receive this emission of the motive species, so that the species can exist or subsist nowhere in the world but in the bodies of the mobile things themselves.","743":"And, exactly like light, between the source and the movable thing it does not exist, but will have a quasi-existence.","744":"Moreover, at the same time, a reply can be made here to a possible objection.","745":"For it was said above that this motive power is extended throughout the space of the world, in some places more spread out and in others more concentrated, and that the intensification and remission of the motions of the planets are consequent upon this variation.","746":"Now, however, it has been said that this power is an immaterial species of its source, and never inheres in anything except a mobile subject, such as the body of a planet.","747":"But these appear to be contradictory: to lack matter and yet to be subject to geometrical dimensions; to be poured out throughout the whole world, and yet not to exist anywhere but where there is something movable.","748":"The reply is this: although the motive power is not anything material, nevertheless, since it is designed for carrying matter (namely, the body of a planet), it is not free from geometrical laws, at least on account of this material action of carrying things about.","749":"Nor is there need for more, for we see that those motions are carried out in space and time, and that this power arises and emanates from the source through the space of the world, all of which are geometrical entities.","750":"So this power should indeed be subject to other geometrical necessities.","751":"But lest I appear to philosophize with excessive insolence, I shall propose  to the reader the clearly authentic example of light, since it also makes its nest  in the sun, thence to break forth into the whole world as a companion to this motive power.","752":"Who, I ask, will say that light is something material?","753":"Nevertheless, it carries out its operations with respect to place, suffers alteration,7 is reflected and refracted, and assumes quantities so as to be dense or rare, and to be capable of being taken as a surface wherever it falls upon something illuminable.","754":"Now just as it is said in optics, light too, and this motive power as well, does not exist in the intermediate space between the source and the illuminable, even though it passed through it, but quasi-existed there.","755":"Moreover, although light itself does indeed flow forth in no time, while this power creates motion in time, nonetheless the way in which both do so is the same, if you consider them correctly.","756":"Light manifests those things which are proper to it instantaneously, but so far as it is connected with matter, it too requires time.","757":"It illuminates a surface in a moment, because here matter need not undergo any alteration, for all illumination takes place according to surfaces, or at least as if a property of surfaces and not as a property of corporeality as such.","758":"On the other hand, light bleaches colors in time, since here it acts upon matter qua matter, making it hot and expelling the contrary cold which is embedded in the body's matter and is not on its surface.","759":"In precisely the same manner, this moving power perpetually and without any interval of time is present from the sun wherever there is a suitable movable body, for it receives nothing from the movable body to cause it to be there.","760":"On the other hand, it causes motion in time, since the movable body is material.","761":"Or if it seems better, frame the comparison in this manner: light is  constituted for illumination, and it is just as certain that power is constituted for motion.","762":"Light does everything that can be done to achieve the greatest illumination; nonetheless, it does not happen that color is most greatly illuminated.","763":"For color intermingles its own peculiar species with the illumination of light, thus forming some third entity.","764":"In like manner, there is no slowing in the moving power to prevent the planet's having as much speed as it has itself, but the planet's speed is not therefore that great, since something intervening prevents that, namely, some sort of matter possessed by the surrounding aether, or the disposition of the movable body itself to rest (others might say, \"weight,\" but I do not entirely approve of that, except, indeed, where the earth is concerned).","765":"It is the tempering effect of these, together with the weakening of the motive power, that determines a planet's periodic time.","766":"Chapter 34","767":"The body of the sun is magnetic, and rotates in its space.","768":"Concerning that power that is closely attached to the bodies of the planets and pulls them, we have already said how it is formed, how it is akin to light, and what it is in its metaphysical being.","769":"Next, we should contemplate the deeper nature of its source, shown by the outflowing species (acting as an archetype).","770":"For it may appear that there lies hidden in the body of the sun something divine, which may be compared to our soul, from which flows that species driving the planets around, just as from the soul of someone throwing pebbles a species of motion comes to inhere in the pebbles thrown by him, even when he who threw them removes his hand from them.","771":"And to those who proceed soberly, other reflections will soon be provided.","772":"Now because the power that is extended from the sun to the planets moves  them in a circular course around the immovable body of the sun, this cannot happen, or be conceived in thought, in any other way than this, that the power traverses the same path along which it carries the other planets.","773":"This has been observed to some extent in catapults and all violent motions.","774":"Thus, Fracastoro and others, relying on a story told by the most ancient Egyptians, spoke with little probability when they said that perchance some of the planets, their orbits being deflected gradually beyond the poles of the world, would thus afterwards move in a path opposite to the rest and to their modern course ^1.","775":"For it is much more likely that the bodies of the planets are always borne in that direction in which the power emanating from the sun tends.","776":"But this species is immaterial, proceeding from its body out to this distance without the passing of any time, and is in all other respects like light.","777":"Therefore, it is not only required by the nature of the species, but likely in itself owing to this kinship with light, that along with the particles of its body or source it too is divided up, and when any particle of the solar body moves towards some part of the world, the particle of the immaterial species that from the beginning of creation corresponded to that particle of the body also always moves towards the same part.","778":"If this were not so, it would not be a species, and would come down from the body not in straight but in curved lines.","779":"Since the species is moved in a circular course, in order thereby to confer motion upon the planets, the body of the sun, or source, must move with it, not, of course, from space to space in the world\u2014for I have said, with Copernicus, that the body of the sun remains in the center of the world\u2014but upon its center or axis, both immobile, its parts moving from place to place, while the whole body remains in the same place.","780":"In order that the force of the analogical argument may be that much more evident, I would like you to recall, reader, the demonstration in optics that vision occurs through the emanation of small sparks of light2 toward the eye from the surfaces of the seen object.","781":"Now imagine that some orator in a great crowd of people, encircling him in an orb,3 turns his face, or his whole body along with it, once around.","782":"Those of the audience to whom he turns his eyes directly also see his eyes, but those who stand behind him then lack the view of his eyes.","783":"But when he turns himself around, he turns his eyes around to everyone in the orb.","784":"Therefore, in a very short interval of time, all get a glimpse of his eyes.","785":"This they get by the arrival of a small spark of light or species of color descending from the eyes of the orator to the eyes of the spectators.","786":"Thus by turning his eyes around in the small space in which his head is located, he carries around along with it the rays of the spark of light in the very large  orb in which the eyes of the spectators all around are situated.","787":"For unless the spark of light went around, his spectators would not be recipients of his eyes' glance.","788":"Here you see clearly that the immaterial species of light either is moved around or stands still along with that of which it is the species either moving or standing still ^4.","789":"Therefore, since the species of the source, or the power moving the planets, rotates about the center of the world, I conclude with good reason, following this example, that that of which it is the species, the sun, also rotates.","790":"However, the same thing is also shown by the following argument.","791":"Motion that is local and subjected to time cannot inhere in a bare immaterial species, since such a species is incapable of receiving an effect of an applied motion unless the received motion is non-temporal, just as the power is immaterial.","792":"Also, although it has been proved that this moving power rotates, it cannot be allowed to have infinite speed (for then it would seem that the power will also impart infinite speed to the bodies), and therefore it completes its rotation in some period of time.","793":"Therefore, it cannot carry out this motion by itself, and it is as a consequence necessary that it is moved only because the body upon which it depends is moved.","794":"By the same argument, it appears to be a correct conclusion that there does not exist within the boundaries of the solar body anything immaterial by whose rotation the species descending from that immaterial something also rotates.","795":"For again, local motion which takes time is not correctly attributed to anything immaterial.","796":"It therefore remains that the body of the sun itself rotates in the manner described above, indicating the poles of the zodiac by the  poles of its rotation (by a line extended from the center of the body to the fixed stars through the poles), and indicating the ecliptic by the greatest circle of its body, thus furnishing a natural cause for these astronomical entities.","797":"Further, we see that the individual planets are not carried along with equal  swiftness at every distance from the sun, nor is the speed of all of them at their various distances equal.","798":"For Saturn takes 30 years, Jupiter 12, Mars 23 months, earth 12, Venus 8\u00bd, and Mercury 3.","799":"Nevertheless, it follows from what has been said that every orb of power emanating from the sun (in the space embraced by the lowest, Mercury, as well as that embraced by the highest, Saturn) is twisted around with a whirl equal to that which spins the solar body, with an equal period.","800":"(There is nothing absurd in this statement, for the emanating power is immaterial, and by its own nature would be capable of infinite speed if it were possible to impress a motion upon it from elsewhere, for then it could be impeded neither by weight, which it lacks, nor by the obstruction of the corporeal medium.)","801":"It is consequently clear that the planets are ill-suited to emulate the swiftness of the motive power.","802":"For Saturn is less receptive than Jupiter, since its returns are slower, while the orb of power at the path of Saturn returns with the same swiftness as the orb of power at the path of Jupiter, and so on in order, all the way to Mercury, which, by example of the superior planets, doubtless will move more slowly than the power that pulls it.","803":"It is therefore necessary that the nature of the planetary globes be material, from an inherent property, arising from the origin of things, to be inclined to rest or  to the privation of motion ^5.","804":"When the tension between these things leads to a fight, that planet which is placed in a weaker power overcomes it more, and is moved more slowly by it; that which is closer to the sun overcomes it less.","805":"This analogy shows that there is in all planets, even in the lowest, Mercury, a material force of disengaging itself somewhat from the orb of the sun\u2019s power.","806":"From this it is concluded that the rotation of the solar body anticipates  considerably the periodic times of all the planets; therefore, it must rotate in its space at least faster than once in a three-months\u2019 span.","807":"However, in my Mysterium Cosmographicum I pointed out that there is about the same ratio between the semidiameters of the sun\u2019s body and the orb of Mercury as there is between the semidiameters of the body of the earth and the orb of the moon.","808":"Hence, you may plausibly conclude that the period of the orb of Mercury would have the same ratio to the period of the body of the sun as the period of the orb of the moon has to the period of the body of the earth.","809":"And the semidiameter of the orb of the moon is sixty times the semidiameter of the body of the earth, while the period of the orb of the moon (or the month) is a little less than thirty times the period of the body of the earth (or day), and thus the ratio of the distances is double the ratio of the periodic times.","810":"Therefore, if the doubled ratio also holds for the sun and Mercury, since the diameter of the sun's body is about one sixtieth of the diameter of Mercury's orb, the time of rotation of the solar globe will be one thirtieth of 88 days, which is the period of Mercury's orb.","811":"Hence it is likely that the sun rotates in about three days.","812":"You may, on the other hand, prefer to prescribe the sun's diurnal period in such a way that the diurnal rotation of the earth is dispensed by the diurnal rotation of the sun, by some sort of magnetic force.","813":"I would certainly not object.","814":"Such a rapid rotation appears not to be alien to that body in which lies the first activation of every motion.","815":"This opinion (on the rotation of the solar body as the cause of the motion for the other planets) is beautifully confirmed by the example of the earth and the moon.","816":"For the chief, monthly motion of the moon, by the force of the demonstrations used in Chapters 32 and 33, is entirely derived from the earth as its source (for what the sun is for the rest of the planets there, the earth is for the moon in this demonstration).","817":"Consider, therefore, how our earth occasions the motion of the moon: while this our earth, and its immaterial species along with it, rotates twenty nine and one half times about its axis, at the moon this emitted species can drive it around only once in the same time, in (of course) the same direction in which the earth leads it.","818":"Here, by the way, is a marvel: in any given time the center of the moon traverses twice as long a line about the center of the earth as any place on the surface of the earth beneath the great circle of the equator.","819":"For if equal spaces were measured out in equal times, the moon ought to return in sixty days, since the size of its orb is sixty times the size of the earth's globe.","820":"This is surely because there is so much force in the immaterial species of the earth, while the lunar body is doubtless of great rarity and weak resistance.","821":"Thus, to remove your bewilderment, consider that on the principles we have supposed it would necessarily follow that if the moon were not to resist, by its material force, the motion impressed from outside by the earth, the moon would be carried at exactly the same speed as the earth's immaterial species, that is, with the earth itself, and  would complete its circuit in 24 hours, in which the earth also completes its circuit.","822":"For even if the tenuity of the earth's species is great at the distance of 60 semidiameters, the ratio of one to nothing is still the same as the ratio of sixty to nothing.","823":"Hence the immaterial species of the earth would prevail completely, if the moon did not resist.","824":"Here, one might inquire of me, what sort of body I consider the sun to be, from which this motive species descends.","825":"I would ask him to proceed under the guidance of a further analogy, and urge him to inspect more closely the example of the magnet brought up a little earlier, whose power resides in the entire body of the magnet, grows with its mass, and is itself also divided when the magnet is diminished.","826":"So in the sun the moving power appears so much stronger that it seems likely that its body is of all [those in the world] the most dense.","827":"And the power of attracting iron is spread out in an orb from the magnet so  that there exists a certain orb within which iron is attracted, but more strongly so as the iron comes nearer into the embrace of that orb.","828":"In exactly the same way the power moving the planets is propagated from the sun in an orb, and is weaker in the more remote parts of the orb.","829":"The magnet, however, does not attract with all its parts, but has filaments  (so to speak) or straight fibers (seat of the motor power) extended throughout its length, so that is a little strip of iron is placed in a middle position between the heads of the magnet at the side, the magnet does not attract it, but only directs it parallel to its own fibers.","830":"Thus it is credible that there is in the sun no force whatever attracting the planets, as there is in the magnet, (for then they would approach the sun until they were quite joined with it), but only a directing force, and consequently that is has circular fibers all set up in the same direction, which are indicated by the zodiac circle","831":"Therefore, as the sun forever turns itself, the motive force or the outflowing of the species from the sun\u2019s magnetic fibers, diffused through all the distances of the planets, also rotates in an orb, and does so in the same time as the sun, just as when a magnet is moved about, the magnetic power is also moved, and the iron along with it, following the magnetic force.","832":"The example of the magnet I have hit upon is a very pretty one, and entirely  suited to the subject; indeed, it is little short of being the very truth.","833":"So why should I speak of the magnet as if it were an example?","834":"For, by the demonstration of the Englishman William Gilbert,6 the earth itself is a big magnet, and is said by the same author, a defender of Copernicus, to rotate once a day, just as I conjecture about the sun.","835":"And because of this very thing, that it has magnetic fibers intersecting the line of its motion at right angles, those fibers therefore lie in various circles about the poles of the earth parallel to its motion.","836":"I am therefore absolutely within my rights to state that the moon is carried along by the rotation of the earth and the motion of its magnetic power, only thirty times slower.","837":"I know that the earth\u2019s filaments and its motion indicate the equator, while  the circuit of the moon is generally related to the zodiac \u2013 on this point there will be more in Chapter 37 and Part 5.","838":"With this one exception, everything fits: the earth is intimately related to the lunar period, just as the sun is to that of  the other planets.","839":"And just as the planets are eccentric with respect to the sun, so is the moon with respect to the earth.","840":"So it is certain that the earth is looked upon by the moon\u2019s mover as a kind of pole star (so to speak), just as the sun is looked upon by the movers belonging to the rest of the planets, for which see Chapter 38.","841":"It is therefore plausible, since the earth moves the moon through its species and is a magnetic body, while the sun moves the planets similarly through an emitted species, that the sun is likewise a magnetic body.","842":"Chapter 35","843":"Whether the motion from the sun, like its light, is subject to privation in the planets through occultations ^1.","844":"This is a good time for me to take up the objections raised in Chapter 33, where to the kinship of light and motive power were opposed, first, the mutual occultations of the celestial bodies, and then, the different [manner of] emanation of the species of the two.","845":"And concerning the first, it is worthy of consideration whether, just as one opaque body intercepts another's sunlight, mobile bodies similarly impede one another in motion when they lie in line with the sun.","846":"If so, light would clearly be the vehicle or instrument of the motive power.","847":"It might appear that in order to avoid this as much as possible, God introduced the relative inclinations of all the eccentrics, deviations from the ecliptic, and transpositions of the nodes, as well as the proportions of the bodies and the attenuation of shadows in a cone.","848":"And since it would not be possible completely to prevent the stars' occasionally lining up with the sun, it is tempting  to suppose that the very slow motions of the apsides and nodes (which are, as it were, a kind of aberration of the epicycles from their periodic times) derive their origin thence.","849":"But it is answered, first, that the analogy between light and motive power is not to be disturbed by rashly confusing their properties.","850":"Light is impeded by the opaque, but is not impeded by a body, because light is light, and does not act upon the body but on the surface (or as if on the surface).","851":"Power acts upon the body without respect to its opacity.","852":"Therefore, since it is not correlated with the opaque, it will likewise not be impeded by the opaque.","853":"On this account I would nearly separate light from moving power, unless I were to come upon examples in nature which leave to the rays of light, even when impeded, a certain efficacy in those locations where their entry is prohibited.","854":"But I am not chiefly concerned here with the association of light with the motive power.","855":"Instead, in order to dissolve this suspicion that the motions are impeded, let us  take another example from the magnet.","856":"Its power is not at all impeded by the interposition of matter (because, of course, it is immaterial), but passes through sheets of silver, copper, gold, glass, bone, wood, and attracts iron lying beyond these sheets exactly as if no sheets were there.","857":"Granted, it is impeded by the interposition of a magnetic plate.","858":"But the cause is ready at hand: the plate acts as a counterpart to the magnet.","859":"It therefore overcomes, by its strength, the more distant magnet lying beyond it.","860":"And although it is impeded by the interposition of the iron plate, this too belongs to the magnetic nature, and it immediately drinks up the magnet's power and uses it as if it were its own.","861":"Therefore, in order that we may deny that the motion of the celestial bodies is impeded by central conjunctions of two of them, we must say that the nature of the sun differs from the nature of the rest of the celestial bodies more than the nature of the magnet differs from the nature of iron.","862":"Also, we must deny that the planets drink up the power all at once from the sun in the same way as the iron drinks it from the magnet.","863":"The question of whether they drink up any of it at all, I defer to Chapter 57.","864":"In respect to the likelihood of the cause of the apogees' motion, it proves  nothing concerning this common solar power being impeded by occultation ^2.","865":"For the motion of the apogees could be quite different; for instance, it could have an animate origin.","866":"You will find a certain obscure opinion on this point below in Chapter 57 ^3.","867":"Further, if the motion of the apogees were to arise because the motion of the planets around the sun is impeded by the occultation of the motive species emanating from the sun, the motion in longitude would be slowed, either by a progressive motion of latitude (by which the apogees would move back) or equally by slowing of the latitudinal motion.","868":"Thus, the apogees would stand still, although the observations testify that they move forward.","869":"But the question whether, once the sun is preserved as the source of motion, the motions proper to the celestial bodies are impeded by occultation,4 will also be discussed in Chapter 57.","870":"Chapter 36","871":"By what measure the motive power from the sun is attenuated as it spreads through the world.","872":"There follows another, rather more difficult objection, arising from the second argument that was raised in Chapter 33 against the kinship of light and motive power, which seems irreconcilably at odds with our study of immaterial species.","873":"This objection wearied me for a long time without offering any prospect of solution.","874":"It was demonstrated in Chapter 32 that the intension and remission of the planets' motion is in simple proportion to the distances.","875":"It appears, however, that the power emanating from the sun should be intensified and remitted in the duplicate or triplicate ratio of the distances or lines of efflux.","876":"Therefore, the intension and remission of the planets' motion will not be a result of the attenuation of the power emanating from the sun.","877":"The logical consequence appears to be proved in the following manner, for light as well as for  moving power; however, discussions of light are clearer.","878":"The reader should read in \"motive power\".","879":"Initially, let \u03b1 be any point on the sun's body.","880":"It will therefore spread out its rays to every orb, and from a demonstration in optics, as the amplitude of the greater spherical surface \u03b3, considered as an imaginary terminus for those rays, is to the amplitude of the smaller, \u03b2, so will the density of light at the smaller orb \u03b2 be to its density at the greater \u03b3.","881":"Next, let \u03b4\u03b5 be any luminous great circle on the body of the sun.","882":"Thus its individual points, of which there are an infinity, spread out rays to the individual hemispheres \u03b2 and \u03b3 in the same ratio.","883":"And the apparent magnitude of the diameter of the circle at the shorter distance (i.e., the angle \u03b4\u03b2\u03b5) is to the apparent magnitude at the greater distance (i.e., the angle \u03b4\u03b3\u03b5), conversely, as the longer distance \u03b1\u03b3 from such a circular line (which at a distance appears straight) is to the shorter \u03b4\u03b2.","884":"So, since this diameter appears longer from the nearby point \u03b2 than from the distant point \u03b3, in the same ratio, while the radiation belonging to any given point is denser at a nearby point \u03b2 than at a distant point \u03b3, it is therefore apparent that the density of radiation of the circle at the nearby point \u03b2 will have to the density of radiation at the distant point \u03b3 the [inverse of the] duplicate ratio of \u03b1\u03b2 to \u03b1\u03b3.","885":"Thirdly, let \u03b4\u03b1\u03b5 be the apparent disc of the sun's body, and since similar surfaces (as are the apparent circular discs here) are in the duplicate ratio of their diameters, while the apparent diameters of the sun are in the simple inverse ratio of the distances \u03b1\u03b3, \u03b1\u03b2, the circular discs will therefore appear in the duplicate ratio of the distances \u03b1\u03b3, \u03b1\u03b2.","886":"But since the radiation of the circle \u03b4\u03b5 at \u03b3 and \u03b2 was just proved to be in the duplicate ratio of the distances \u03b1\u03b2, \u03b1\u03b3, while both are causes of the density [of radiation], it appears that the radiation of the disc, with respect to density or strength, is in the triplicate ratio of the distances \u03b1\u03b3, \u03b1\u03b2.","887":"For example, if the distances \u03b1\u03b3 to \u03b1\u03b2 were as 2 to 1, the radiations of the point at \u03b1\u03b3 and \u03b1\u03b2 would be as 1 to 2, with respect to the density of light, and the apparent diameters of circles would be 1 at \u03b3 and 2 at \u03b2.","888":"Therefore, the radiation of the diameter of the circle \u03b4\u03b5 would be 1 at \u03b3 and 4 at \u03b2. But the discs are in the duplicate ratio of the diameters.","889":"Therefore the apparent magnitude of the disc at \u03b3 would be 1, and at \u03b2, 4, as if you were to say that the disc \u03b4\u03b1\u03b5 when seen from \u03b2 appears to contain four times as many points as when seen from \u03b3. Any of these points illuminates twice as densely at \u03b2 than at \u03b3. Therefore, when the ratios are compounded, the density of radiation of the whole disc \u03b4\u03b1\u03b5 at \u03b3 would have to the density of radiation of the whole disc \u03b4\u03b1\u03b5 at \u03b2 the ratio 1 to 8.","890":"It does not trouble us here that we are reckoning from the sun's apparent disc, although it is a spherical surface.","891":"For the ratio of equally many things to each other mutually is the same.","892":"But the spherical surface was demonstrated by Archimedes to be four times the area of the greatest circle described in the sphere.","893":"Therefore, a body at \u03b3, twice as far away as at \u03b2, should have appeared to be fully eight times as obscurely illuminated at \u03b3 as at \u03b2, not just twice.","894":"For it seems that the brightness of the rays ought to be intensified because of the fact that bodies appear to be magnified when they approach, as [for example] Venus, when at the perigee of the epicycle, defines a more evident shadow around bodies than at apogee.","895":"Therefore, by the force of the analogy which we have instituted between light and motive force, the same should be thought to apply to the motive force.","896":"To this objection, I answer decisively, that in the initial supposition involving the point I made a false assumption.","897":"Even though I did indeed say something like that in the Optics, you should bear in mind that I was speaking of optics, whose points and lines are not quite indivisibles.","898":"For, as concerns the point, since it has no magnitude, while the rays are amplified with the magnitudes of bodies, it follows that the radiation of a point in itself is nothing, and hence what has no radiation has no greater or lesser density.","899":"Thus the initial assumption of the ratio of distances \u03b1\u03b2 to \u03b1\u03b3 collapses.","900":"Rather, because of this very thing, we say that any point shines more strongly or weakly to the extent that that point designates to us a greater or lesser quantity.","901":"In the second supposition, concerning the circle, and the third, concerning the disc, there are two false assumptions.","902":"The first is that a mathematical circle, lacking breadth, is supposed to shine.","903":"For it can no more shine itself than can the point from whose motion the circle is supposed to be generated.","904":"You are no closer to having a surface when you posit a line of three stadia1 than you are in positing a line of three feet.","905":"Second, it is supposed that the optical magnification of the diameter or of the disc adds to the strength of the rays, although this is but a deception of the visual faculty, and belongs to the genus of theoretical entities, which lack any efficacy.","906":"The physical identity of the circle \u03b4\u03b5, the surface \u03b4\u03b1\u03b5 (when light is in question) and the body \u03b4\u03b5 (when power is in question) remains the same whether it is viewed from \u03b3 or from \u03b2, and will always act the same and have the same effect, spreading the same amount of power or light in the more diffuse orb \u03b3 as in the more compact orb \u03b2. Nothing is lost in the journey: the entire species carries through to any distance, however remote.","907":"It is attenuated only in the extensions of the spheres, so that in the individual points of the spheres, such as \u03b3 and \u03b2, it is rarer in the former, and denser in the latter, in the inverse ratio of the distances \u03b1\u03b2 to \u03b1\u03b3.","908":"This is the sole cause of the weakening, not the diminishing of the source \u03b4\u03b5, which in fact does not happen, being but an optical illusion.","909":"Indeed, if I might argue from Euclid's Optics here, less light arrives at the nearer, \u03b2, than at the more remote, for the reason that at \u03b2 a smaller circle bounds the visible hemisphere of the luminous body \u03b4\u03b5 than at \u03b3. Therefore, not so many particles of the sun \u03b4\u03b5 can be seen from \u03b2 as from \u03b3. But this is quite imperceptible, hard to express [even] in enormous numbers.","910":"And I, after giving this answer to myself, am having a good laugh at my wretched alarm arising from this obscure business.","911":"But the objection can rebound in the opposite direction, thus.","912":"If there is the same amount of light spread out in a large sphere as there is gathered together in a small sphere, there will not be the same amount of power in both places, for power is not considered orbicularly in a sphere as light is, but in the circle in which the planet proceeds.","913":"Thus, the magnetic filaments of the sun were supposed, above, to be set up only in longitude, not towards the poles or in other directions.","914":"The answer is that the cause of light and motive power is exactly the same, and there is a deception in the reasoning.","915":"For in light, the  rays do not flow out solely from the individual points and circles of the body to the corresponding points and circles of the sphere.","916":"Thus, the rays from \u03b3 do not come only from \u03b1 (by which arrangement it would be impossible to ascribe a density to light in the spheres, since it would have no quantity in its origin, descending as it does from a point).","917":"Instead, the rays flow out from the whole hemisphere of the lucid body to the individual points of the imaginary spherical surface: thus, the rays from both \u03b4 and \u03b5 flow out to \u03b3. The same thing takes place likewise with power.","918":"Even though the magnetic filaments of the solar body are ordered according to zodiacal longitude, and even though there is but a single great circle of the sun's body beneath the zodiac or ecliptic, and roughly beneath the orbit of the planet, and (finally) even though the other smaller circles (which are compacted to the size of points beneath the poles) are subordinated to their corresponding circles in the sphere of the planet, nevertheless, the rays from all the filaments of the solar body (standing up from one hemisphere of the body) flow down and converge on the individual points of the path of any of the planets as well as on those poles that are above the poles of the sun's body, and the body of the planet is transported according to the measure of the density of this entire species compounded of all the filaments.","919":"It does not, however, follow that just as the sun shines equally in all directions, the planets, too, as you might fear, are moved indiscriminately in all directions.","920":"For the magnetic filaments of the sun, considered in themselves, do not move, but only inasmuch as the sun, rotating very rapidly in its space, carries the filaments around, and with them the moving species spreading abroad from them.","921":"Therefore the planet will not go backwards, because the sun always rotates forwards.","922":"The planet will not go to the poles (even though there might be some of the species from the sun's body at those points) because the filaments of the solar body are not extended in the direction of the poles, nor does the sun rotate in that direction, but rather in the direction in which its filaments urge it.","923":"On these suppositions, it is so far from being the case that the planets are carried towards the poles that there is instead a single region of the zodiac, the mean between the poles, through which all planets of necessity would move in longitude without deflection, if they were to cease their own proper motions (of which see Chapter 38 below).","924":"For the species of the solar hemisphere which takes up a post at some point of the zodiac, such as the point \u03b6 in the present diagram, is the total of the filaments of the semicircle all tending in the same direction in concert, as, from [the region from] \u03b8 through \u03ba, from \u03bb through \u03bc, etc ^2.","925":"But when you move off towards the poles of the world, as at \u03b7, then because one pole \u03bd of the sun's body, and the complete circles \u03bb\u03bc that surround the pole \u03bd, are appropriated under the purview of \u03b7\u03bc, the species is made up of filaments tending in opposite directions, for the opposite parts \u03bb and \u03bc of the circles move in opposite directions.","926":"Therefore that species \u03b8\u03b7\u03bc descending near the poles is less well adapted to the motion carrying the planets along.","927":"Chapter 37","928":"How the power moving the moon may be constituted.","929":"Since in Chapter 34, in passing, I made mention of the motion of the moon, it would be appropriate to treat the matter in greater detail, so that no reservation introduced by the moon might deflect the reader into withholding his ready assent from me on the entire treatise; so that it might instead be marvelously confirmed, by the clearest consideration of the lunar motion; and finally, to ensure that the physical aspects of astronomy are treated fully in this book.","930":"For even though there are a few things in the theory of the moon that must be deferred, as they are to be treated differently or explained in more detail, they nevertheless will have their origin here.","931":"After long and painstaking observations of the moon in every position in relation to the sun, Tycho Brahe expressed the opinion that in the moon, besides the anomaly of the epicycle, and besides that monthly anomaly which was also known to Ptolemy, the mean motion itself (so named in relation to these two inequalities) is not yet quite \"mean.\"","932":"That is, it intensifies at the conjunctions and oppositions with the sun, and is remitted at the quadratures.","933":"Thus, even if it were undisturbed by epicycles, the moon itself, even though moving on a circle concentric with the earth, would move around  nonuni","934":"formly ^1.","935":"Let S be the body of the sun, M the orb of Mercury, V of Venus, T of the earth, P of Mars, and so on.","936":"And let all of them always move from right to left when in the upper part of the diagram.","937":"Now let CLOF be the orb of the moon, O the moon at opposition, C at conjunction, L, F at quadratures, and let CLOF remain for now a concentric described about the earth at T, and let it move in the direction OFCL.","938":"The question is, by what cause is the moon made to move more swiftly about T at C, O than at F, L, since we have just now mentally removed the eccentricity and the epicycles.","939":"Here, I know, the reader expects me to say that it is swifter at O because at that place its motion is in the same direction as the motion of all the planets.","940":"But this is not the true cause.","941":"For in that case, what would happen at C is what in fact happens, that the moon, in its compounded motion, is slowest, since its proper motion FCL resists considerably this common rightward motion ^2.","942":"For it should be noted that the moon, from point C on its orb, is borne less in the leftward direction L than the earth is borne to the right on its orb.","943":"Therefore, the moon, by a motion compounded of its proper motion and that which it has in common with the earth, also always moves to the left when above, as when the earth is at \u03b4, but here, when the earth is down low at T, it is carried to the right, but slowly at C and swiftly at O. A motion of this sort is expressed approximately by the spiral lines set out here.","944":"But perhaps you are expecting me to say instead that this phenomenon arises from the sun's motive power being weaker at O and stronger at C?","945":"Much less will I say this.","946":"For I would thus make it slow at O and C, and fast at F, L, which is contrary to what is desired.","947":"For if it is propelled weakly at O, it therefore is slow, and if it is held back more strongly at C, so that its tendency to move in the opposite direction from C to L is less, it will therefore again move slowly from C to L. Thus it was not correct for us to free the moon from the earth and commit it to the sun.","948":"This would cause it at length to wander away from the earth, just as the apogees wander from their places.","949":"It would be preferable to attribute to the earth a force that retains the moon, like a sort of chain, which would be there even if the moon did not circle the earth at all.","950":"On this supposition, the moon is, as it were, in the same boat with the earth, in the same power of the sun, and now, as if freed from this motion from the sun, it is rotated separately by the earth.","951":"Therefore, I consider the cause of the swiftness at O and C to be none other than this, that the earth T derives its power of moving the moon from the sun S, and preserves it by the continuity of the line TS.","952":"Thus SCTO can properly be called the \"diameter of power\" since these two (T and S) are the sources of the entire motion.","953":"On this supposition, that monthly inequality known to Ptolemy also will follow.","954":"For if the power coming from the same source T is stronger at C, O than at F, L, then if the apogee is near C, O, there is a greater loss of speed than if the apogee were at F, L. Thus when going from the apogee at O or C the equations at F, L are greater than when going from the apogee at F, L to the conjunctions and oppositions O, C.","955":"You see, then, that these physical speculations are so devised that they can even account for the phenomena of the moon.","956":"The moon is not driven to","957":"circle the earth primarily by the sun, but by a power lying hidden in the earth itself, and casting forth its immaterial species to the body of the moon, but more strongly along the line that connects the centers of the sun (the primary source) and the earth.","958":"It is, however, hard to explain more clearly how that diameter comes to be more powerful.","959":"For neither the sun's power nor the earth's, going out to the","960":"moon, is any swifter when the moon falls on that diameter.","961":"That the rotations of these bodies (and therefore also of the species) are uniform and forever constant, is a highly reasonable presumption.","962":"There remains only the possibility described here, that the power is indeed not swifter, but more robust, when it emanates from the earth in the directions nearer to the line ST, for the reason that it was originally drawn off from the sun to the earth along that line.","963":"Nevertheless, it is the sun which, either immediately or through that faculty which effects annual motion for the earth, is the principal director of the motion which the earth confers upon the moon.","964":"This is demonstrated chiefly by the moon's making its circuit beneath the zodiac, like the annual circuit of the centre of the earth, although the earth's diurnal motion, which confers the monthly motion upon the moon, takes place beneath the equator.","965":"Chapter 38","966":"Besides the common motive force of the sun, the planets are endowed with an inherent force [vis insita], and the motion of each of them is compounded of the two causes.","967":"I have spoken of the origin of the motion which rotates the planets around the sun or the moon around the earth; that is, I have spoken of the natural causes of the circle which in the theories of the planets is called either eccentric or concentric, according to the various intentions of the authors.","968":"Now, some thing must be said of the natural cause of the eccentricity, or in the particular hypothesis of Copernicus, of the epicycle on a concentric.","969":"For the moving power from the sun has hitherto been uniform, having different degrees only at various amplitudes of the circles.","970":"Its innate quality is such that if a planet were to remain at the same distance from the sun it would be carried around perfectly uniformly, and would not experience any intension or remission of the solar motion.","971":"The modicum of nonuniformity perceived in the working of this power arises from the planet's having been transposed from one distance from the sun to another, so that it encounters one or another degree of strength of this power from the sun.","972":"The question therefore arises, if, as Brahe demonstrated, there are no solid orbs, how does the planet come to ascend from and descend towards the sun?","973":"Can this, too, really come from the sun?","974":"My answer is that it is to some extent from the sun, and to some extent not from the sun.","975":"Examples of natural things, and this hitherto disparaged kinship of  celestial things for terrestrial ones, cry out that in a simple body the operations which are more general are simpler, while the variables, if any (such as, in the motion of the planets, the varying distance from the sun, or the eccentricity), arise from the concurrence of extrinsic causes.","976":"Thus, in a river, the simple property of water is to descend towards the  centre of the earth.","977":"But because its path is not direct, it flows in to those places where it finds a lower bed, stagnates where it meets with level ground, and is carried along with a roar where it comes upon steeper slopes; there is a place where it may be spun into whirlpools, if in a swift drop it should dash into projecting rocks.","978":"Where water itself, by its inherent force, endeavors to do nothing but descend towards the centre of the earth, a simple action by a simple property, nevertheless, flow and stagnation and waves and whirlpools and every variety [of phenomena] arise from the causes described, which are adventitious and accidental.","979":"Particularly happy and better accommodated to our inquiry are the phenomena exhibited by the propulsion of boats.","980":"Imagine a cable or rope hanging high up across a river, suspended from both banks, and a pulley running along the rope, holding, by another rope, a skiff1 floating in the river.","981":"If the ferryman in the skiff, otherwise at rest, fastens his rudder or oar in the right manner, the skiff, carried crosswise by the simple force of the downward-moving river, is transported from one bank to the other, as the pulley runs along the cable above.","982":"On broader rivers they make the skiffs go in circles, send them hither and thither, and play a thousand tricks, without touching the bottom or the banks, but by the use of the oar alone, directing the singular and most simple flow of the river to their own ends.","983":"In very much the same manner, the power moving out from the sun into the world through the species is a kind of rapid torrent, which sweeps along all the planets, as well as, perhaps, the entire aethereal air, from west to east.","984":"It is not itself suited to attracting bodies to the sun or driving them further from it, which would be an infinitely troublesome task.","985":"It is therefore necessary that the planets themselves, rather like the skiffs, have their own motive powers, as if they had riders [vectores] or ferrymen, by whose forethought they  accomplish not only the approach to the sun and recession from the sun, but also (and this might be called the second argument) the declinations of latitudes; and as if from one bank to the other (that is, from north to south and back), travel across this river (which itself only follows the course of the ecliptic) from north to south and back.","986":"It is certain from what has been said above that the power which comes from the sun is simple.","987":"But now, the eccentrics of the planets do not just decline from the ecliptic, but go in various directions, intersecting one another and the ecliptic.","988":"Therefore, other causes are conjoined with the motive power from the sun.","989":"Chapter 39","990":"By what path and by what means the powers seated in the planets ought to move them, in order that the planet's circular orbit, such as is commonly thought to exist, be brought about in the aethereal air.","991":"And so, let these points of great certainty in what has been demonstrated be  axioms for us.","992":"First, that the body of a planet is inclined by nature to rest in  every place where it is put by itself.","993":"Second, that it is transported from one longitudinal position to another by that power which originates in the sun.","994":"Third, if the distance of the planet from the sun were not altered, a circular path would result from this transport.","995":"Fourth, supposing the same planet to be in turn at two distances from the sun, remaining there for one whole circuit, the periodic times will be in the duplicate ratio of the distances or magnitude of the circles.","996":"Fifth, the bare and solitary power residing in the body of a planet itself is not sufficient for transporting its body from place to place, since it lacks feet, wings, and feathers by which it might press upon the aethereal air.","997":"And nevertheless, sixth, the approach and recession of a planet to and from the sun arises from that power which is proper to the planet.","998":"All these axioms are agreeable to nature in themselves, and have been demonstrated previously.","999":"Now let us work with geometrical figures in order to see what laws will be  required to represent any desired planetary orbit.","1000":"Let the orbit of the planet be a circle, as has been believed until now, and let it be eccentric with respect to the sun, the source of power.","1001":"Let that eccentric CD be described about center B with radius BC, and on it let BC be the line of apsides, A the sun, and BA the eccentricity.","1002":"Let the eccentric be divided into any number of equal parts, beginning from the line of apsides at C, and let the ends of these parts be connected with A. Therefore, CA, DA, EA, FA, GA, HA, will be the distances of the end points of the equal parts from the source of power.","1003":"Now with center \u03b2, radius \u03b2\u03b3, equal to AB, let the epicycle \u03b3\u03b4 be described, divided into as many equal parts as the eccentric, beginning from \u03b3, and let the line \u03b3\u03b2 be extended so as to make \u03b2\u03b1 equal to BC, and let the point \u03b1 be connected with the end points of the equal parts of the epicycle, by the lines \u03b3\u03b1, \u03b4\u03b1, \u03b5\u03b1, \u03b6\u03b1, \u03b7\u03b1, \u03b8\u03b1.","1004":"These lines will be respectively equal to the distances drawn to the eccentric from A, this having been demonstrated above in Chapter 2.","1005":"Next, with center \u03b1 and radius \u03b4\u03b1, let the arc \u03b4\u03b9\u03b8 be described, intersecting the diameter \u03b3\u03b6 at \u03b9 and about the same center \u03b1, with radius \u03b1\u03b5, let the arc \u03b5\u03bb\u03b7 be described, intersecting the diameter \u03b3\u03b6 at \u03bb, and let the end points of the parts equidistant from the aphelion of the epicycle \u03b3 be connected by the lines \u03b4\u03b8, \u03b5\u03b7, which will intersect the diameter at \u03ba, \u03bc, so that \u03b1\u03b4 or \u03b1\u03b9 is longer than \u03b1\u03ba, and \u03b1\u03b5 or \u03b1\u03bb longer than \u03b1\u03bc.","1006":"If it were possible for the planet to move on a perfect epicycle by its inherent force,1 and for its orbit at the same time to be a perfect circle, then we would have to consider similar arcs to be swept out in the same times, on the eccentric and on the epicycle.","1007":"Consequently, it would now immediately  become clear by what means, and by what measure, the distance \u03b1\u03b9 would be made equal to AD.","1008":"For since \u03b1\u03b9 and \u03b1\u03b8 are equal, when the planet moves from \u03b3 to \u03b8 the distance \u03b1\u03b8 necessarily and without any special contrivance comes out right, equal to AD.","1009":"But aside from one appearing to be in conflict with the fifth axiom, who  claims that the planet moves locally from \u03b3 to \u03b8 by its inherent force, many additional absurdities are also involved.","1010":"For let AN be drawn parallel to BD, and let AN be equal to BD, and about center N let an epicycle be described which shall go through D. Now since CD is a perfect circle, the same angles are swept out by the planet D about the center of the eccentric B as by the center of the epicycle N about the center of the sun A (through the equivalence demonstrated in Chapter 2), as long as the diameter of the epicycle ND with the planet at D always remains parallel to AB with respect to its position in the world.","1011":"Therefore, the speed of the center of the epicycle N about the sun A would be made the same as the speed of the planet D about the center of the eccentric B, so that those motions would be intensified at the same time and remitted at the same time.","1012":"And since intension and remission depends upon greater or less distance of the body  of the planet from the sun, therefore the center of the epicycle, remaining at the same distance, would be contrived to move slowly or swiftly on account of the planet's being farther from or nearer to the sun.","1013":"And although the power driving the planets is faster than any of them, as is shown in Chapter 34, we are here to suppose in our imagination a single ray of power AN  coming from the sun, as if there were a line upon which the center of the epicycle N would always remain.","1014":"And this line, with that same center N, would be now slow,  now swift, again contrary to what was said above, that the power always produces the same speed at the same distance.","1015":"Moreover, we would be required to suppose that the  planet has its own rotatory motion away from this imaginary ray AN in the opposite direction, traversing unequal distances in equal times, according as this ray itself  were swifter or slower.","1016":"In adopting this account, we would indeed approach more closely the geometrical suppositions of the ancients, but we would stray very far from physical theory, as is shown in Ch.","1017":"2.","1018":"And my thoughts on the matter have not sufficed to discover a way in which these things can happen naturally.","1019":"Now all this would be conceived more simply were we to consider the  diameter of the epicycle ND as always remaining parallel to itself.","1020":"For then the planet would carry out its motion by a mental image, not of the epicycle, but of the center of the eccentric B, and by keeping itself always at the same distance from that center.","1021":"But at the beginning of this work, in Chapter 2, it was said to be most  absurd that a planet (even if you give it a mind) may imagine for itself a center  and from it a distance, when in that center there is no particular body for the planet to be aware of.","1022":"Now you might say that the planet observes the sun A, and already knows beforehand, through memory, which ordered distances from the sun a perfect eccentric would have to attain.","1023":"But first, this is more indirect, and depends upon something intermediate connecting the effect of the perfectly circular path with the indication of the waxing and waning of the sun's diameter, and this too in some mind.","1024":"But that intermediate can be nothing but the position of the center of the eccentric B at a certain distance from the sun, which, as has just now been said, cannot be known by an unassisted mind.","1025":"I do not deny that a center can be conceived, and about it a circle.","1026":"But I do  say this, that if the center is established by thought alone, without respect to time and without any external indication, it is impossible to set up about it, in reality, the perfectly circular path of some movable body.","1027":"Besides, if the planet were to derive its correct distances from the sun,  ordained by the rule of the circle, from memory, it could also derive from memory the equal arcs of the eccentric which are to be traversed in unequal times, and which are to be traversed by an extrinsic force originating in the sun, as if it were obtaining the values right from the Prutenic or Alphonsine tables.","1028":"Thus it would know from memory beforehand what this extrinsic and mindless power originating in the sun was going to do.","1029":"All of these are absurd:\u2014","1030":"Chiefly since, as Aristotle affirms, there is no knowledge of the infinite,  while the infinite is involved in this intension and remission.","1031":"But it is all right, because even the observations themselves will not allow CD to be a perfect circle, below in Chapter 44, so these theoretical arguments, weak though they are thought to be, do not stand alone, and are that much the less vulnerable to scornful rejection.","1032":"It is consequently more fitting that the planet itself require no assistance, whether of epicycle or eccentric, but rather that the task which it either performs by itself or has a part in performing is a reciprocating path along the diameter \u03b3\u03b6 directed towards the sun \u03b1.","1033":"The question now is, what is the measure by which the planet metes out the correct distances for any given time?","1034":"Now to us the measure is clear from geometry and the diagram.","1035":"For whenever the solar power moves the planet forward to the line DA, we then find the angle CBD and make \u03b3\u03b2\u03b4 equal to it; and thus we say that \u03b1\u03b4, or \u03b1\u03b9 which is its equal, is the correct distance from A to the planet at D. But this measure which we have proposed for humans, we have just now denied the planet when we removed it from the circumference of the epicycle and restricted it to the straits of the diameter \u03b3\u03b6.","1036":"Indeed, in this inquiry it is easier to say what is not the case than to say what is.","1037":"This is because at the moments when the sun has placed the planet on the lines drawn from A through C, D, E, F, G, H, the planet itself is presumed to have produced the distances \u03b3\u03b1, \u03b9\u03b1, \u03bb\u03b1, \u03b6\u03b1, \u03bb\u03b1, \u03b9\u03b1, respectively.","1038":"Consequently, if the path of the planet is a perfect circle, then to equal parts of the eccentric CD, DE, EF, correspond unequal descents of the planet along the diameter, namely, \u03b3\u03b9, \u03b9\u03bb, \u03bb\u03b6.","1039":"Moreover, the order is perturbed: the highest is not the smallest, nor the lowest the greatest, but the middle parts \u03b9\u03bb are greatest, and the extremes \u03b3\u03b9  and \u03bb\u03b6 are smaller, and the highest \u03b3\u03b9 are a little smaller than the corresponding lowest, \u03bb\u03b6.","1040":"For \u03b3\u03ba and \u03bc\u03b6 are equal, and \u03b3\u03b9 is smaller than \u03b3\u03ba, while \u03bb\u03b6 is greater than \u03bc\u03b6.","1041":"Furthermore, this same cause prevents \u03b3\u03b9, \u03b9\u03bb, \u03bb\u03b6, being made proportional to either the times of the equal arcs traversed CD, DE, EF, or to the angles at the sun CAD, DAE, EAF.","1042":"For the time or duration of the planet on equal parts of the eccentric CD, DE, EF, is continuously diminished from the highest to the lowest points, and the angles at the sun are continuously increased, but the reciprocations \u03b3\u03b9 are increased in the middle regions, such as \u03b9\u03bb.","1043":"Therefore, if the path of the planet is a perfect circle, the measure of the planet's descent on the diameter \u03b3\u03b6 is neither time, nor distance traversed on the eccentric, nor the angle at the sun.","1044":"And physical theories, too, also decisively repudiate these measures.","1045":"What, then, if we should say this: although the motion of the planet does  not take place on an epicycle, this reciprocation is measured out in such a way that distances from the sun are produced that are similar to those which exist in an epicycle actually traversed?","1046":"First, this attributes to the power belonging to the planet a knowledge of the imaginary epicycle and of its effects in setting out distances from the sun; and further, it attributes knowledge of the future speed or slowness which the common motion from the sun is going to cause.","1047":"For it is necessary to suppose here an imaginary intension and remission of motion on the imaginary epicycle that is the same as that of the motion on the real eccentric.","1048":"This is more incredible than the previous accounts, where the motion of the body was combined with knowledge of the epicycle or eccentric.","1049":"Therefore, the objections raised there should be understood as applying here as well, the judgements being nearly identical.","1050":"Nevertheless, for want of a better opinion, we must at present put up with  this one.","1051":"And as for its involving many absurdities, in Chapter 57 below, a certain physicist will quite readily allow this: that on the testimony of the observations the path of the planet is not a circle.","1052":"So far, the discussion has concerned the measure relating to the form of  this reciprocation.","1053":"It now remains for us to find the measure of this measure; that is, the measure of the quantity or of motion through place.","1054":"For it is not enough for the planet to know how far it should be from the sun: it also has to know what to do in order to be at the correct distance.","1055":"Now anyone who is so attracted to the supposition of a perfectly circular  orbit as to locate in the planet a mind which could preside over the reciprocation, can say only this: that this planetary mind observes the increasing and decreasing size of the solar diameter, and understands, using this as an indication, what distances from the sun it should cause to occur at any given time.","1056":"For example, sailors cannot know from the sea itself how far they have travelled over the waters, since the course, viewed in that way, has no distinct limits.","1057":"Instead, they find this either from the amount of time they have sailed, if wind and sea remain constant and the ship does not stop, or from the direction of the wind and the changing elevation of the pole, or from all or several of these in conjunction, or, may it please the gods, by a contrivance of a number of wheels, with paddles lowered into the water (for certain conceited mechanics are proposing an instrument of this sort, who ascribe the calm of the continents to the waves of the Ocean) ^2.","1058":"In just the same way, the mind  of the planet cannot by itself measure its position, or the distance between itself and the sun, since between them there is pure aethereal air, devoid of any  means of indication.","1059":"So it makes use either of the increment of time, and an equal exertion of forces through that time (which has just been denied above), or of a physical machine, which is ridiculous (for by the example of the sun and moon we suppose the celestial bodies to be round, and it is therefore also probable that the entire field of the aetheral air moves around with the planets),3 or finally, of some suitable means of indication that are variable with the altered distance of the planet from the sun.","1060":"And other than the sun's apparent diameter alone, nothing else presents itself.","1061":"Thus we humans know that the sun is 229 of its own semidiameters distant from us when its diameter subtends 30', and 222 semidiameters when it subtends 31' ^4.","1062":"If it were indeed certain that this proper motion of the planet along the diameter of the epicycle could not be carried out by any material and corporeal or magnetic power of the planet, nor by an unassisted animate power, but that  it is governed by a planetary mind, nothing absurd would be stated ^5.","1063":"For that the sun is observed by the planets in other respects as well, the latitudes bear witness.","1064":"For by these latitudes the planets would depart from the middle and royal road of this solar power, as from the mainstream of a river, and move to the sides, as is said in Chapter 38, unless they meanwhile paid attention to the sun, and carried out their approach and recession along a line drawn to its center.","1065":"They would then describe circles which, seen from the earth or the center of the world, would appear smaller, parallel to some great circle.","1066":"But all planets describe great circles that intersect the ecliptic at points that are opposite with respect to the sun, as was demonstrated for Mars from observations  above in Chapters 12, 13, and 14.","1067":"Therefore, the diameter of reciprocation \u03b3\u03b6 is also directed towards the sun, and the latitudes heed the sun in every respect.","1068":"However, in Part 5 below I will also transfer this characteristic of the latitude from the elements of mind to the elements of nature and magnetic faculties.","1069":"Now one cannot say in reply to me that the solar diameter and its variation is far too small to be used as a standard.","1070":"For it is certain that there is no planet for which it entirely vanishes.","1071":"Since on earth it is thirty minutes, on Mars it will be twenty, on Jupiter seven, and on Saturn three, while on Venus it will be forty, and on Mercury at least eighty and sometimes as high as one hundred and twenty.","1072":"Do not grumble about the smallness of the body, but rather the unapt coarseness of human senses, which cannot follow such small things.","1073":"One should on the contrary note that this body, however nonetheless capable of moving such distant bodies in a circle, as is demonstrated in the preceding chapters.","1074":"The illumination of the world by such a tiny corpuscle is known to all.","1075":"And so it is credible that if the movers are endowed with some faculty of observing its diameter, this faculty is as much more acute than our eyes as its work, and the perpetual motion, is more constant than our own troubled and confused schemes.","1076":"So then, Kepler, would you give each of the planets a pair of eyes?","1077":"By no  means, nor is this necessary, no more than that they need feet or wings in order  to move.","1078":"But Brahe has recently eliminated solid orbs.","1079":"Now our theorizing has not emptied nature's treasure house: we still cannot establish, through our own knowledge, how many senses there ought to be.","1080":"There are even examples at hand worthy of our admiration.","1081":"For tell us, in physical terms: with what eyes shall the animate faculties of sublunar bodies look upon the positions of the stars in the zodiac, so that when a harmonic arrangement (which we call \"aspects\") is found among them, the bodies leap up and become inflamed for their task?","1082":"Was it with her eyes that my noted the positions of the stars in order to know that she was born with Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Venus, and Mercury, all in sextiles and trines?","1083":"And could it have been by the same means that she gave birth to her children, and especially to me her first born, chiefly on those days when as many as possible of the same aspects, especially of Saturn and Jupiter, recurred, or when as many pristine positions as possible were occupied by squares, oppositions, and conjunctions?","1084":"I have observed those things in all cases whatever that have occurred to this very day.","1085":"But why do I say these things that are just as absurd as the previous ones, but for those who have exercised themselves in natural matters more diligently than is usual nowadays?","1086":"So our hypothetical person who says that the planet's path is a perfect circle will say this: that the planet performs its reciprocation so as to make the diameters of the sun, at the end points of equal arcs of the eccentric, appear very nearly*  inversely proportional to the lines \u03b4\u03b1, \u03b5\u03b1, \u03b6\u03b1, or to \u03b9\u03b1, \u03bb\u03b1, \u03b6\u03b1, which are equal to them, taken with respect to the longest line \u03b3\u03b1; and that through this consideration of the diameters of the sun at the chosen moments of time, come the proximities of \u03b9, \u03bb, \u03b6 to \u03b3.","1087":"It should be known, however, that the increases of the diameter of the sun and the arcs of the epicycle do not square with each other well, and so the motive mind will have to have a very good memory in order to adjust the unequal versed sines of the arcs on the epicycle to the equal increases of the solar diameter.","1088":"For this, see Ch.","1089":"56 and 57 below.","1090":"Let that be enough concerning the means of indicating distances.","1091":"There  remains a third point about the animate faculty that carries the planet around that I briefly draw attention to: anyone who says that the body of a planet is moved by an inherent force is just plain wrong.","1092":"This we rejected at the beginning.","1093":"But it is also impossible simply to ascribe this force to the sun instead.","1094":"For the same force that attracts the planet also repels it in turn, and this is inconsistent with the simplicity of the solar body.","1095":"But anyone who by some unique argument reduces this motion to the bodies of the sun and the planet in concerted action gives a new cast to the material of this entire chapter, and under this rubric Chapter 57 below is specifically assigned for this topic.","1096":"You see, my thoughtful and intelligent reader, that the opinion of a perfect eccentric circle for the path of a planet drags many incredible things into physical theories.","1097":"This is not, indeed, because it makes the solar diameter an indicator for the planetary mind, for this opinion will perhaps turn out to be closest to the truth, but because it ascribes incredible faculties to the mover, both mental and animate.","1098":"But we, who are close to the truth, should find out how to cast these theories (which, though not everywhere perfect, are nonetheless suitable for the sun's motions) in numerical form.","1099":"In the end, it will be helpful for a more exact discovery of the truth, reserved for Chapter 57, that we had previously worked on them here.","1100":"Chapter 40","1101":"An imperfect method for computing the equations from the physical hypothesis, which nonetheless suffices for the theory of the sun or earth.","1102":"Such a long-winded discussion was necessary to prepare a way for a natural form for the equations, on which I am going to be very busy in Part 4.","1103":"Now we must return to the equations of the sun's eccentric in particular, which is the main subject of this third part, and for the sake of which the general discussion of the last eight chapters has been presented.","1104":"My first error was to suppose that the path of the planet is a perfect circle, a supposition that was all the more noxious a thief of time the more it was endowed with the authority of all philosophers, and the more convenient it was for metaphysics in particular.","1105":"Accordingly, let the path of the planet be a perfect eccentric, for in the theory of the sun the amount by which it differs from the oval path is imperceptible.","1106":"Those things that are going to be needed for the other planets, on account of this deviation, follow below in ch.","1107":"59 and 60.","1108":"Since, therefore, the time increments of a planet over equal parts of the eccentric are to one another as the distances of those parts, and since the individual points of the entire semicircle of the eccentric are all at different distances, it was no easy task I set myself when I sought to find how the sums of the individual distances may be obtained.","1109":"For unless we can find the sum of all of them (and they are infinite in number) we cannot say how great the time increment is for any one of them.","1110":"Thus the equation will not be known.","1111":"For the whole sum of the distances is to the whole periodic time as any partial sum of the distances is to its corresponding time.","1112":"I consequently began by dividing the eccentric into 360 parts, as if these were least particles, and supposed that within one such part the distance does not change.","1113":"I then found the distances at the beginnings of the parts or degrees by the method of chapter 29, and added them all up.","1114":"Next, I assigned an artificial round number to the periodic time; although it is in fact 365 days and 6 hours, I set it equal to 360 degrees, or a full circle, which for the astronomers is the mean anomaly.","1115":"As a result, I have so arranged it that as the sum of  the distances is to the sum of the time, so is any given distance to its time.","1116":"Finally, I added the times over the individual degrees and compared these times, or degrees of mean anomaly,  with the degrees of the eccentric anomaly, or the number of parts whose distance was sought.","1117":"This furnished the physical equation, to which the optical equation, found by the method of Chapter 29 with those same distances, was to be added in order to have the whole.","1118":"However, since this procedure is mechanical and tedious, and since it is impossible to compute the equation given the ratio for one individual degree without the others, I looked around for other means.","1119":"And since I knew that the points of the eccentric are infinite, and their distances are infinite, it struck me that all these distances are contained in the plane of the eccentric.","1120":"For I had remembered that Archimedes, in seeking the ratio of the circumference to the diameter, once thus divided a circle into an infinity of triangles - this being the hidden force of his reductio ad absurdum.","1121":"Accordingly, instead of dividing the circumference, as before, I now cut the plane of the eccentric into 360 parts by lines drawn from the point whence the eccentricity is reckoned.","1122":"Let AB be the line of apsides, A the sun (or earth, for Ptolemy); B the center of the eccentric CD, whose semicircle CD shall be divided into any number of equal parts CG, GH, HE, EI, IK, KD, and let the points A and B be connected with the points of division.","1123":"Therefore, AC will be the greatest distance, AD the least, and the others, in order, are AG, AH, AE, AI, AK.","1124":"And since triangles under equal altitudes are as their bases, and the sectors, or triangles, CBG, GBH, and so on (standing upon least parts of the circumference and therefore not differing from straight lines) all have the same altitude, the equal sides BC, BG, BH, they are therefore all equal.","1125":"But all the triangles are contained in the area CDE, and all the arcs or bases are contained in the circumference CED.","1126":"Therefore, by composition, as the area CDE is to the arc CED so is the area CBG to the arc CG, and alternately, as arc CED is to CG, CH, and the rest in order, so is the area CDE to the areas CBG, CBH, and the rest in order.","1127":"Therefore, no error is introduced if the areas be taken for the arcs in this way, and substituting the areas CGB, CHB for the angles of eccentric anomaly CBG, CBH.","1128":"Further, just as the straight lines from B to the infinite parts of the circumference are all contained in the area of the semicircle CDE, and the straight lines from B to the infinite parts of the arc CH are all contained in the area CBH, therefore also the straight lines from A to the same infinite parts of the circumference or arc make up the same thing.","1129":"And finally, since those drawn from A and B both fill up one and the same semicircle CDE, while those from A","1130":"are the very distances whose sum is sought, it therefore seemed to me I could conclude that by computing the area CAH or CAE I would have the sum of the infinite distances in CH or CE, not because the infinite can be traversed, but because I thought that the measure of the faculty by which the collected distances mete out the times is contained in this area, so that we would be able to obtain it by knowing the area without an enumeration of least parts.","1131":"Therefore, from the above, as the area CDE is to half the periodic time, which we have proclaimed to be 180\u00b0, so are the areas CAG, CAH to the times on CG and CH.","1132":"Thus the area CGA becomes a measure of the time or mean anomaly corresponding to the arc of the eccentric CG, since the mean anomaly measures the time ^1.","1133":"Earlier, however, the part CGB of this area CAG was the measure of the eccentric anomaly, whose optical equation is the angle BGA.","1134":"Therefore, the remaining area, that of the triangle BGA, is the excess (for this place) of the mean anomaly over the eccentric anomaly, and the angle BGA of that triangle is the excess of the eccentric anomaly CBG over the equated anomaly CAG.","1135":"Thus the knowledge of this one triangle provides both parts of the equation corresponding to the equated anomaly GAC.","1136":"And hence it is manifest why in Chapters 30 and 31 above I said that in  the theory of the sun the parts of the equation are very nearly equal.","1137":"That is, any given arc, and the angle at the center which it subtends (as CG and CBG in the figure), are measured by its area, which is called the \"sector\", as area CBG.","1138":"Therefore, with one arm of the compass at G, with radius GB, let an arc of the circumference be described intersecting GA at O. Hence, as the area GBC is to the angle GBC, so is the area BGO to the angle BGO.","1139":"But the angle BGO is the optical part of the equation.","1140":"Thus the area GOB, through the doubling of the part of the equation, measures the optical part of the equation, for in our account presented earlier the whole area GBA was to be consulted for the physical part of the equation.","1141":"Now clearly the genuine measure of the physical part of the equation AGB exceeds the proposed measure of the optical part OGB by the small space or area OAB (while near the perigee the latter in turn exceeds the former by a small area).","1142":"Nevertheless, if the eccentricity is small, as is that of the sun or earth, with which we are concerned in this third part, this is not perceptible.","1143":"For the nearer it approaches to the line of apsides, the narrower becomes the whole triangle AGB and consequently also its little part AOB, however much its altitude AO increases at the same time.","1144":"On the other hand, in the middle elongations, the angle BEA with its sector is at a certain point directly measured by the area BEA, and the excess begins to turn into a defect.","1145":"Therefore, the greatest difference that can occur is that accumulated at the octants, or locations intermediate between the apsides and the quadrants.","1146":"How great that difference is, will now be shown.","1147":"Since for some time now I have used the same form of computation by means of areas in the theory of Mars, I could not ignore this difference on account of the planet's great eccentricity, nor did the doubling of the optical equation avoid all perceptible error.","1148":"It was therefore necessary to investigate the area of the triangle of the equation [triangulum aequatorium].","1149":"This can be done in various ways, but I shall go on to state the easiest.","1150":"It is well known that triangles with equal altitudes are proportional to\ntheir bases.","1151":"I say also, that triangles on equal bases are proportional to\ntheir altitudes.","1152":"Let AGB, AHB stand upon the same base AB extended to C. From G let the line GN be drawn parallel to the common base AB and intersecting HB at N, and let N be connected with A. From the three vertices G, \u0397, N, of the triangles let GM, HL, MP be drawn perpendicular to the base, determining the altitudes of the triangles.","1153":"Therefore, since GN and MP are parallel, and GM, NP are perpendicular [to them], GM and NP will be equal.","1154":"But GM is the altitude of triangle AGB, and NP is the altitude of triangle ANB.","1155":"Therefore triangles ANB and AGB have equal altitudes, and since they are both on the same base AB, they are equal.","1156":"And since ANB is part of AHB, and the base line HB is common, together with the vertex A, the triangles NAB and HAB have equal altitudes.","1157":"Therefore, as the base NB is to BH, so is NAB to HAB.","1158":"But NAB and GAB were proved equal.","1159":"Therefore, as NB is to BH, so is GAB to HAB.","1160":"But as BN is to BH, so is NP to HL, because NBP and HBL are similar triangles.","1161":"Therefore also, as NP is to HL, so is GAB to HAB.","1162":"But NP and GM are equal.","1163":"Therefore, as GM is to HL, altitude to altitude, so is area GAB to area HAB.","1164":"q.e.d.","1165":"Now let BE be perpendicular to CD, and let the triangle BEA have a right angle at B. BE will be the altitude, and BA the base.","1166":"Therefore, by Euclid I.42, 900, or half the base BA (which for the sun is 1800), multiplied by the altitude BE, 100,000, which is the radius of the circle, gives the area of the triangle BEA, that is, 90,000,000.","1167":"But  the area of a circle of radius 100,000 (from the most recent investigations of Adrian Romanus, a most expert geometer)2 is 31,415,926,536, with no error in even the last digit.","1168":"And as this the area of the circle is to the 360\u00b0 of mean anomaly or time (that is, 21,600' or 1,296,000\"), so is the area of the triangle, 90,000,000, to 3713\"; that is, 1\u00b0 1' 53\".","1169":"So the area BEA has a value of 1\u00b0 1' 53\".","1170":"But in Chapters 29 and 30, the angle BEA was also 1\u00b0 1' 53\".","1171":"Therefore, both parts of the equation are equal at this place, that is, near 90\u00b0.","1172":"At other degrees of eccentric anomaly, we proceed as follows.","1173":"Since BEA is 3713\", as its altitude EB is to HL or GM, the altitudes of the other triangles \u2014that is, as the whole sine is to the sines of the eccentric anomaly HBC, GBC\u2014so is 3713\" to the areas of the remaining triangles.","1174":"So 3713\" will be multiplied by the sines of the angles at B, and, with the last five digits struck, the remainder will be the physical part of the equation expressed in seconds, corresponding to the angle at B. For example, let HBC be 45\u00b0 43' 46\", as it was above in Ch.","1175":"31.","1176":"Therefore, its sine, 71605, multiplied by 3713\", with the last five digits struck, gives 2659\", that is, 44' 19\".","1177":"In the table above, we assumed this to be equal to the optical part of the equation, 43' 46\".","1178":"Therefore, this little area ABO at its greatest does not exceed 33\".","1179":"And this is that fourth procedure for computing the eccentric equations, of which I began to speak above near the end of Chapter 34, which closely expresses the very nature of things and the foregoing theories of Chapters 32 and 33.","1180":"Nevertheless, my argument contains a paralogism, not, indeed, of great  moment.","1181":"It arises from this: that while Archimedes did indeed divide the circle into an infinity of triangles, they stood upon the circumference at right angles, so that their vertices were at the center of the circle B. But one cannot proceed in the same way with triangles standing upon the circumference with their vertices at A, because the circumference is intersected obliquely by the straight lines from A in all places other than C and D.","1182":"You could have found this error empirically, as I myself did, by taking all the distances AC, AG, AH, at the individual whole degrees of the angle CBG, GBH, and adding them all up.","1183":"(These distances, though they are presented in the table in Chapter 30, correspond in position to individual whole degrees of the angle at A, and consequently to angles at B cut minutewise.","1184":"Nevertheless,  one could easily find, by interpolation, the distance from A corresponding to any angle of an integral number of degrees about B.)","1185":"Now the sum comes out to be greater than 36,000,000, although 360 of the distances from B add up to exactly 36,000,000.","1186":"But, on the contrary, if both sums were measured by the same area of the circle, the sums ought to have been equal.","1187":"A demonstration of the error, on the other hand, is as follows.","1188":"Through B let any straight line other than CD be drawn, intersecting the circumference, and let it be EF; and let the points of intersection E and F be connected with A. Now since the point A does not lie on the line EF, EAF is a figure, a triangle.","1189":"Therefore, EA, AF together are longer than EF, by Euclid I.22.","1190":"But the area of the circle contains the sum of all lines EF, and therefore it contains a sum which is less than all the lines EA, AF, since any two opposite points on the eccentric, together with A, determine such a triangle, with the exception of C, D, A, where instead of a triangle there is a straight line.","1191":"I would add, in passing, that it is also proved, in the same way, that the distances from A corresponding to all of the 360 integral degrees of the angle at A (which are in the table in Chapter 30 above), added up in one sum, are less than 36,000,000.","1192":"For through the point A let any straight line other than CD be drawn (let it be EV), and let E and V be connected with B. In the triangle EBV, the straight lines EB, BV together will be longer than EA, AV, two opposite distances.","1193":"But all 360 of EB, BV taken together are 36,000,000.","1194":"Therefore, all 360 of EA, AV taken together are less than 36,000,000.","1195":"To return to what I was saying, this method of finding the equations is not only very easy indeed, and based upon the natural causes of the motion explained above, but also agrees most precisely with the observations in the theory of the sun or earth.","1196":"Nevertheless, it errs in two respects.","1197":"First,  it supposes that the orbit of the planet is a perfect circle, which, as will be demonstrated below in Ch.","1198":"44, is not true.","1199":"Second, it uses a plane which does not exactly measure the distances of all points from the sun.","1200":"Nevertheless,  as if by a miracle, each of these exactly cancels the effect of the other, as is demonstrated below in Chapter 59 ^3.","1201":"And because at the present time there are first-rate geometers who on occasion labor endlessly on matters whose usefulness is not so evident, I call upon one and all to help me here to find some plane figure equal to the sum of the distances.","1202":"I have indeed myself found it geometrically - in a broad sense - but let them show me how to express numerically what I have delineated geometrically; that is, let them show how to square the figure I have found.","1203":"Let the circumference CED be unfolded into a straight line and divided into as many parts as before at the points G, \u0397, E, I, K, and let perpendiculars be set up at the points of division equal to the radius CB, and let the parallelogram be completed.","1204":"This will be double the Archimedean triangle, by which he measured the area of the semicircle.","1205":"Now if you were to make individual parallelograms in this manner in the individual sectors, then the whole parallelogram divided into parts will be equivalent to the whole area of the semicircle; that is, the ratio 2:1 holds everywhere.","1206":"Now, in the same manner, let the distances CA, GA, and so on, be set up, and the points A be connected by the conchoid*  A, A, A, A, drawn through the individual points (which are potentially infinite): the figure AACD will be equivalent to all the distances from A. For similarly the individual lines AG, AH have approximately made up the one parallelogram, except that the conchoid is not parallel to CD, but inclined to the radii GA, HA, EA, exactly as the distances are inclined to the circumference in the circle itself.","1207":"Hence, there is nothing wrong with the conchoid's being made longer than the semicircle CD.","1208":"But EA is longer than EB, so that, if CA, GQ, HR, EB, IS, KL, DA, be taken, equal to lines determined by perpendiculars drawn from A to the lines between the points and B (as, in the circular diagram, the perpendicular AR is dropped to HB extended, defining HR which is shorter than HA), the figure between the conchoid AQRBSLA and CD would be quite equal to the figure CBBD.","1209":"For the conchoid would intersect BB at the line EA, and because BA at the top and bottom are equal, and BQ is equal to LB, BR to SB, and so on, the figures BBRQA and BBALS would therefore be congruent.","1210":"One of these is added to, and the other subtracted from, the equal figures CBBE and EBBD, and therefore, the whole figure between AQRBSLA and CD is equal to that between BB and CD.","1211":"Hence, the small area between the two conchoids AQRBSLA and AAAAAA is the measure of the excesses of the distances from A over the distances from B \u2014and the standard of measure is the same as that by which the parallelogram is set equal to all the distances from B.","1212":"It should also be noted that this area is not of the same breadth at places equally removed from the line EA, but wider below.","1213":"For in the circular diagram let HBR be extended to V, so that AH, AV correspond respectively to the upper angle HBE and the lower angle FBV, which are equal and are equally removed from the middle points E and F. And about center A with radius AV let the arc XY be drawn through AH and BH.","1214":"Now if you connect A and Y, 4 AYR will be exactly congruent to the triangle AVR, for AV and AY and AX are equal, by construction,  and are the longer sides, while VR, RY are equal and are the shorter.","1215":"But from the point H outside the circumference XY two lines are drawn: HX through the center A, and HY not through the center.","1216":"Therefore, HY is longer than HX, and therefore the greater AV or AX is increased by the shorter XH, and the lesser VR or RY is increased by the longer YH\u2014and nevertheless, the whole RH remains shorter than the whole AH.","1217":"Therefore, the difference between RH and AH is less than the difference between RY and AX, that is, between VR and VA.","1218":"And consequently in the conchoid SA is greater, and RA less, although IE, EH are equal.","1219":"Therefore, the area between the two conchoids is not bisected by EA.","1220":"However, it appears to be bisected by BB, which some geometer should investigate, who should at the same time show how to square the area between the conchoids, so that it may be expressible in numbers.","1221":"In Chapter 43 below you will find a rough estimate of this area.","1222":"Granted, these general considerations of the computation of the physical equation are not yet well enough supported by the geometrical apparatus.","1223":"Nevertheless, I wished to given them a preliminary treatment here, so that when all the planetary inequalities are determined (as, in particular, we presupposed that the course of the sun or earth is a perfect eccentric, which will be denied concerning Mars below in Ch.","1224":"44 and 53), this operation will not be so sharply divorced from its basis in physical theory.","1225":"For, touching the theory of the sun, with which we have been concerned to this point, we introduce no discrepancy either by misjudging the area of the conchoid, which we have taken to be less than it really is, or the assumption of a perfect eccentric, in which we appear to be erring in excess\u2014to what extent cannot yet be said, since all has not been presented.","1226":"But the very things which have been rejected in this chapter as paralogisms will be taken up again below, when we shall have come to a perfectly correct way of expressing the equations, when the thing that gave rise to the paralogism will have been eliminated from that hypothesis.","1227":"I have described within a hair's breadth, through most certain observations and proofs, the cause and measure of the second inequality, which makes the planets appear stationary, direct, and retrograde.","1228":"It has been shown that this second inequality itself shares something in common with the first inequality, and that the theory of the sun or earth (for Copernicus) or of the epicycle (for Ptolemy) is like the theory of the other planets.","1229":"Also, the physical causes of this inequality have been found, and have been adapted to the calculation in the theory of the sun.","1230":"Therefore, it is fitting that I now bring to a close this third part, as a morning task followed by lunch, with the master of the Metamorphoses adding his voice to mine:","1231":"Part remains of what has been begun, part of the work is finished:","1232":"The anchor is
