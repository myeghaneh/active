more sinusoidal harmonics with independent frequencies.","141822":"We study biosignature gases on exoplanets with thin H_(2) atmospheres and habitable surface temperatures, using a model atmosphere with photochemistry and a biomass estimate framework for evaluating the plausibility of a range of biosignature gas candidates.","141862":"We present the Superparticle-Method\/Algorithm for Collisions in Kuiper belts and debris disks (SMACK), a new method for simultaneously modeling, in three dimensions, the collisional and dynamical evolution of planetesimals in a debris disk with planets.","141864":"We show that SMACK is stable to numerical viscosity and numerical heating over 10^(7) yr and that it can reproduce analytic models of disk evolution.","141865":"We use SMACK to

atmosphere can be a natural consequence of a very high atmospheric metallicity.","142052":"From comparisons of our results with Spitzer eclipse data for GJ 436b, we conclude that although the spectral fit from the high-metallicity forward models is not quite as good as the best fit obtained from pure retrieval methods, the atmospheric composition predicted by these forward models is more physically and chemically plausible in terms of the relative abundance of major constituents.","142064":"We present a time dependent radiative transfer model for the atmosphere of WASP-18b which is a massive (10M_(Jup)) hot Jupiter (T_(eq) \u223c 2400 K) exoplanet orbiting an F6V star with an orbital period of only 0.94 days.","142095":"At wavelengths inaccessible for direct observation, we rely on theoretical calculations of self-broadening to support stellar structure and spectral modeling.","142108":"We present the first hydrodynamic escape model for the upper atmosphere that includes all of the detected species in order to explain their presence at high altitudes, and to further constrain the temperature and velocity profiles.","142129":"In particular, by only combining our

why gases such as CH_(3)Cl must have too large of a biomass to be a plausible biosignature gas on planets with Earth or early-Earth-like atmospheres orbiting a Sun-like star.","142601":"To construct the biomass models, we developed a functional classification of biosignature gases, and found that gases (such as CH_(4), H_(2)S, and N_(2)O) produced from life that extracts energy from chemical potential energy gradients will always have false positives because geochemistry has the same gases to work with as life does, and gases (such as DMS and CH_(3)Cl) produced for secondary metabolic reasons are far less likely to have false positives but because of their highly specialized origin are more likely to be produced in small quantities.","142614":"We use models of coupled thermal

209458b and show that the day-night cold trap would deplete TiO if it condenses into particles bigger than a few microns on the planet's nightside, keeping it from creating the observed stratosphere of the planet.","142895":"We discuss the implications of the combined phase-curve information at 3.6, 4.5, and 8 microns and compare the observations to theoretical phase curves derived from

show the strongest signs of disequilibrium.","143045":"Furthermore, we discuss the implications of our models for the inferred C-to-O ratios of exoplanetary atmospheres.","143072":"We will showcase a current example of this problem and discuss why a \u201creturn to source\u201d model of sending all applications back to the original remote source is, in general, insufficient.","143152":"We examined the atmospheric thermal structure of these worlds with an analytic 1-D radiative-convective model, which assumes gray thermal radiative transfer.","143192":"We propose to develop a new numerical tool

an iterative analysis method to derive the stellar and planet properties and uncertainties by combining the available spectroscopic parameters, stellar evolution models, and transiting light curve parameters, weighted by the measurement errors.","143384":"In addition, we developed a modeling package called EXOMOP that utilizes the Levenberg-Marquardt minimization algorithm to find a least-squares best fit and a differential evolution Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm to find the best fit to the light curve.","143469":"We first test this method on a Jupiter-like model with a

incomplete and requires supplementary physical assumptions and interpretations in order to be a viable model for a lensing system.","245740":"We present theoretical stellar evolution model calculations for HD 209458 and discuss the uncertainties involved in deriving the stellar mass and radius.","245743":"However, we find that in deriving the radius of the planet, R_(p), the relevant stellar model input is the M\/R relation, which runs orthogonal to a degeneracy in the transit light-curve solution and greatly improves the estimate of R_(p).","245749":"We also show the effect is stronger than the one already implied by published models that assumed independent power-law distributions for the masses and periods of the extrasolar planets.","245853":"We interpret this additional

in the Galaxy.","247232":"We found from our UV radiation model that an ancient 1 bar CO_(2) atmosphere - by including a photochemical model for the investigation of absorption effects of O_(2), O_(3), NO and NO_(2) - becomes transparent to solar UV radiation above wavelengths of 290 nm.","247233":"For understanding the damaging effect to a number of molecules essential for the evolution of

mass black hole candidate MACHO-96-BLG-5, we propose a time series of observations to follow the declining magnification of 0.4 mag over the next several years as predicted by the microlensing model.","247261":"For the two extra-solar planet candidates reported by the Microlensing Planet Search {MPS} Collaboration, MACHO-97-BLG-41 and MACHO-98-BLG-35, we propose to test the planetary microlensing models by determining the amount of blending between each source star and its neighbors.","247315":"We compare both P_(chr) and the phase dependence of the activity with the planetary orbital period P_(orb), the orbital phase, and models.","247360":"Thus we will quantify the net energy deposited into the planet, the key remaining unknown in comparing the measured planetary radius to theoretical models of its structure and evolutionary history.","248006":"We present a general modeling scheme for investigating the possibility of photosynthesis-based life on extrasolar planets.","248048":"We consider disc models that are thought to be typical of protostellar discs during the planet forming epoch, with characteristic surface densities similar to standard minimum mass solar nebula models.","248106":"We use a new computational approach proposed by the authors, which makes it possible to elaborate high-quality 3D models of the IPD cloud with the number of particle positions in each model as high as 10^(10-11).","248118":"When at least three transits are observed, we show that a cross-correlation technique can yield a detection threshold, thus enabling the

uncertainties are, in general, large.","249431":"Combining the emergent fluxes from recent giant planet\/brown dwarf atmosphere models, stellar data from the Gliese catalog, and a detailed model of coronagraph performance for the case of a seven segment primary mirror, we find that NGST will be capable of imaging planetary companions of Jupiter's mass, age, and orbital semi-major axis around all single stars within 8 pc of the Sun in integration times of three hours or less.","249554":"We developed a model of the temporal power spectrum of this disturbance, whose validity is not limited to low frequencies only, as it is the case with earlier models.","249821":"We compare models and measurements of telescope scattered light and discuss some of the scientific and technical issues that suggest how a low scattered light design could extend the scientific capabilities of moderate (4 m aperture) telescopes.","249888":"We present model geometric albedo and phase-integral spectra and
