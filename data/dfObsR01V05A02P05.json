That is, when two equal circles are described, one, DC, in the plane of the ecliptic, and the other, FE, in the plane of Mars's orbit, about a common center A of the sun (i. e., on one and the same sphere of the fixed stars, concentric with the sun), the sine of the arc BD between the intersection of the circles and some point on Mars's circle, D say, is to the whole sine as the sine of the inclination DF of the point F is to the sine of CE, the greatest inclination, at the limit E. Furthermore, it was proved in Ch. 13 above, using an ingenious treatment of the observations, that the declinations of all the points of the circuit from the plane of the ecliptic are arranged by the same measure. So no instance can be urged against our hypothesis. ","6000":"But there are still two difficult questions to be answered.

It was proven in Chapter 61 that when Mars's eccentricity is constructed from the very center of the sun, or, what is the same, using acronychal observations taken when the planet is at opposition to the sun's apparent position, the nodes fall at positions that are very precisely opposite in relation to the sun's center; that is, that the diameter of the apsides and the diameter of the intersection of the planes of the ecliptic and of Mars coincide, or intersect one another, at the same center from which the eccentricity is computed, namely, at the center of the sun. The question now is, if we use the sun's mean motion instead of its apparent motion, will the nodes as a result still be at opposite positions about the point whence the eccentricity is computed? Not at all. Consider again the Copernican diagram in Chapter 6 ^1. In it let \u03ba\u03b4 now be the line of the limits, at 16\u00be\u00b0 Leo and Aquarius (not, as in Ch. 6, the line of apsides at 29\u00b0 Leo). Therefore, the line [NN'] drawn through \u03ba perpendicular to \u03ba\u03b4 will be the diameter of the nodes. But if we use the mean sun instead of the apparent sun, then we are given \u03b2 instead of \u03ba as the point from which the eccentricity is reckoned. So from \u03b2 let \u03b2\u03c2 be drawn perpendicular to \u03ba\u03b4 [and extended to PP']. This will fall at positions exactly opposite about \u03b2, but will not fall at the positions of the nodes, because the former perpendicular [NN'] through \u03ba, falling at the  positions of the nodes, is above \u03b2\u03c2 by the distance \u03ba\u03c2. It is desirable to enquire into the magnitude of the angles at the circumference of the eccentric when the point \u03ba is connected to the points of intersection of the line \u03b2\u03c2 with the circumference of the eccentric. Since, by supposition, \u03c2\u03ba is at 16\u00b0 45' Leo, and \u03b2\u03ba is at about 5\u00b0 45' Cancer, the angle \u03b2\u03ba\u03c2 will be 41\u00b0; and since \u03b2\u03c2\u03ba is right, \u03ba\u03b2\u03c2 will be 49\u00b0. And since \u03ba\u03b2 is the sun's eccentricity, 3600, where the orb of the earth or the sun is 100,000, therefore, as the whole sine of the angle \u03c2 is to \u03b2\u03ba, 3600, so is the sine of angle \u03b2 to \u03ba\u03c2, 2717. And in the same units (where the semidiameter of the earth\u2019s orb is 100,000), the semidiameter of Mars's orb, from Ch. 54, is 152,350. Therefore, where the semidiameter of Mars's orb is 100,000, \u03ba\u03c2 will be 1790, showing an angle of 1\u00b0 1' 33\" in the [table of] sines. ","6188":" The end is a reply to the beginning.

Therefore, where the semidiameter of Mars's orb is 100,000, \u03ba\u03c2 will be 1790, showing an angle of 1\u00b0 1' 33\" in the [table of] sines. ","6195":" The end is a reply to the beginning. In Chapter 6, I argued on physical grounds that when solid orbs are denied, the eccentricities of the planets cannot take their origin from any point other than the very center of the sun. I postponed part of the geometrical proof of this, based upon the observations, to Chapters 22, 23, and 52, in which places I think I have satisfied even the sharpest- eyed critic. The other part I shall now expound. This is done first through the positions of the nodes. It was proven in Chapter 61 that when Mars's eccentricity is constructed from the very center of the sun, or, what is the same, using acronychal observations taken when the planet is at opposition to the sun's apparent position, the nodes fall at positions that are very precisely opposite in relation to the sun's center; that is, that the diameter of the apsides and the diameter of the intersection of the planes of the ecliptic and of Mars coincide, or intersect one another, at the same center from which the eccentricity is computed, namely, at the center of the sun. The question now is, if we use the sun's mean motion instead of its apparent motion, will the nodes as a result still be at opposite positions about the point whence the eccentricity is computed? Not at all. Consider again the Copernican diagram in Chapter 6 ^1. In it let \u03ba\u03b4 now be the line of the limits, at 16\u00be\u00b0 Leo and Aquarius (not, as in Ch. 6, the line of apsides at 29\u00b0 Leo). Therefore, the line [NN'] drawn through \u03ba perpendicular to \u03ba\u03b4 will be the diameter of the nodes. But if we use the mean sun instead of the apparent sun, then we are given \u03b2 instead of \u03ba as the point from which the eccentricity is reckoned. So from \u03b2 let \u03b2\u03c2 be drawn perpendicular to \u03ba\u03b4 [and extended to PP']. This will fall at positions exactly opposite about \u03b2, but will not fall at the positions of the nodes, because the former perpendicular [NN'] through \u03ba, falling at the  positions of the nodes, is above \u03b2\u03c2 by the distance \u03ba\u03c2. It is desirable to enquire into the magnitude of the angles at the circumference of the eccentric when the point \u03ba is connected to the points of intersection of the line \u03b2\u03c2 with the circumference of the eccentric. Since, by supposition, \u03c2\u03ba is at 16\u00b0 45' Leo, and \u03b2\u03ba is at about 5\u00b0 45' Cancer, the angle \u03b2\u03ba\u03c2 will be 41\u00b0; and since \u03b2\u03c2\u03ba is right, \u03ba\u03b2\u03c2 will be 49\u00b0. And since \u03ba\u03b2 is the sun's eccentricity, 3600, where the orb of the earth or the sun is 100,000, therefore, as the whole sine of the angle \u03c2 is to \u03b2\u03ba, 3600, so is the sine of angle \u03b2 to \u03ba\u03c2, 2717.

For the stars' latitudes did increase, the northern ones around the summer solstice, and the southern ones around the winter solstice. Ptolemy therefore said that Mars's maximum observed northern latitude was 4\u00b0 20', while today it is 4\u00b0 32' ^2. This confirms our opinion, since he shows a maximum latitude that is 12' smaller than today's, while the nodes stayed at approximately the same distance from aphelion as they are today. On the other hand, he makes the southern latitude about 7\u00b0, while today it could also be that much, namely, 6\u00b0 52\u2153\u2018. We are therefore left undecided by his observations. For concerning those 12' in the northern latitude, it should be noted that the smallest graduations on his instruments were 10 minutes, and that he usually supposed an error amounting to one of these parts. Also, the difference between the Greek symbols for 20' and 40' is very small and slippery, often neglected by translators ^3. Nevertheless, the Arabic says 20' here.","6332":"I have stated what is in agreement with the principles established in this work, and by what hypotheses this can be brought about, so that the inclinations of the planes can be made different in different ages.

So much for the sun's motion.","6410":"V","6411":"Now, as for the observations of Mars itself, even if Ptolemy in fact managed to line the astrolabe up accurately on the fixed stars, there is still clearly no more certainty about Mars's zodiacal position (just as in the previous consideration of the sun's position) than there is about the positions of our fixed stars. If Ptolemy committed an error in assigning a fixed star its degree of elongation from the point of the equinox, the same error will be committed in proclaiming the position of Mars. Furthermore, not even the elongation of the fixed  stars from the sun (and thus from the point of Aries from which the sun's elongation is known through its declination) is free from suspicion of error. For consider both the manner in which it is found and the argument of error. In the year 2 of Antonine Ptolemy sought it through the half-illuminated moon ^9. Using the astrolabe, he found the moon's elongation from the sun, and that of Cor Leonis from the moon. Therefore, when the sun's elongation  from the point of the equinox is given, the elongation of the fixed star from the same point is also given*.  Now, in measuring the elongation of the moon from the sun, an error of half a degree appears to have been committed. For the measurement was made at sunset. But the sun when setting appears through refraction higher than it should by about half a degree. Therefore, the moon's elongation appears less than it should, and so also that of Cor Leonis from the sun, and likewise from the equinoctial. Thus it appears that half a degree must be added to the positions of the fixed stars at the time of Ptolemy.\n Therefore, when Ptolemy considered Mars (when observed in relation to the fixed stars) to be at opposition to the sun's mean position, it would now really have been half a degree beyond this opposition.

So although he produced only one observation in order to demonstrate the method, it is nonetheless credible that he consulted several observations, at both the rising and the setting of the sun or moon, finally choosing the one which he saw to be intermediate among many operations that produced various positions.","6423":"Now, as for the observations of Mars itself, even if Ptolemy in fact managed to line the astrolabe up accurately on the fixed stars, there is still clearly no more certainty about Mars's zodiacal position (just as in the previous consideration of the sun's position) than there is about the positions of our fixed stars. If Ptolemy committed an error in assigning a fixed star its degree of elongation from the point of the equinox, the same error will be committed in proclaiming the position of Mars. Furthermore, not even the elongation of the fixed  stars from the sun (and thus from the point of Aries from which the sun's elongation is known through its declination) is free from suspicion of error. For consider both the manner in which it is found and the argument of error. In the year 2 of Antonine Ptolemy sought it through the half-illuminated moon ^9. Using the astrolabe, he found the moon's elongation from the sun, and that of Cor Leonis from the moon. Therefore, when the sun's elongation  from the point of the equinox is given, the elongation of the fixed star from the same point is also given*.  Now, in measuring the elongation of the moon from the sun, an error of half a degree appears to have been committed. For the measurement was made at sunset. But the sun when setting appears through refraction higher than it should by about half a degree. Therefore, the moon's elongation appears less than it should, and so also that of Cor Leonis from the sun, and likewise from the equinoctial. Thus it appears that half a degree must be added to the positions of the fixed stars at the time of Ptolemy.\n Therefore, when Ptolemy considered Mars (when observed in relation to the fixed stars) to be at opposition to the sun's mean position, it would now really have been half a degree beyond this opposition.

Therefore, the node is 87\u00bd\u00b0 past Cor Leonis. But Mars is 56\u00b0 35' past Cor Leonis. Therefore, it is 31\u00b0 from the node, making the inclination 57\u00bd\u2019, which, by the parallax of the orb, results in a true latitude of 1\u00b0 7' ^19.

The tenth comes close to the calculation.","5967":"The eleventh corresponds to a hair when refraction is excluded.","5968":"The twelfth is barely two minutes greater than the calculation.","5969":"I believe this is because there is that much uncertainty in my instruments.","5970":"For in my quadrant of six cubits, two minutes are not easily discerned.","5971":"We therefore have the acronychal latitudes determined accurately enough throughout the entire circumference of the circle, using this inclination of 1\u00b0 50' 30\".","5972":"An examination of the remaining latitudes at observations at positions other than acronychal, of which there are many closely spaced examples in this book, I leave to more diligent scholars.","5973":"Chapter 63","5974":"Physical hypothesis of the latitude.","5975":"It was said in Chapter 57 that if the diameter of the body or globe of Mars is  supposed to possess a magnetic force, and to be directed towards the middle elongations, and also to remain parallel to itself in that disposition throughout its entire circuit, the physical hypothesis of the eccentricity is complete.","5976":"This supposition is all the more probable in that now the reason for the latitude too is explained using a closely related theory: that there be supposed some diameter of latitude in the body or globe of Mars that is directed towards the sidereal position of the limits, and remains parallel to itself in this disposition throughout its entire circuit.","5977":"The ratio of this power to the former is that which [the power] of direction towards the pole in our magnets has to the force of attracting iron.","5978":"That is, the former seeks the sun or flees it, while the latter, rather than seeking by sailing towards, or fleeing, those sidereal positions beneath which the limits of the latitude are reached, is only directed towards those positions, as a magnet towards the pole (for likewise, a magnet does not sail towards the polar region even if it floats freely) ^1.","5979":"In fact, the excursion of the planet from the plane of the ecliptic to either side follows the direction towards which this axis of inclination, on the side that leads in the motion of its body, is pointed.","5980":"Let CBAD be the ecliptic, A, C the nodes;","5981":"B, D the limits.","5982":"And let the axis of latitudes in the body of the planet be GNH, EAF, LOM, ICK.","5983":"Now since we are supposing this axis to remain equidistant from itself throughout its circuit, it will happen that as the body moves from the ascending node C to the northern limit B, the axis IK of the body, which initially, at the node C, was tangent as it were to the imaginary circle of its circulation through CNAO, later intersects it at right","5984":"angles at the limits N, O, being directed towards the center of the world S, that is, towards the sun.","5985":"But also, owing to a certain amount of declination from the royal road2 CBA, this axis had thus far been enticing the body of the planet to leave that path in the direction of N, towards which it had turned the preceding part K. Now, at the limits, although it has indeed remained inclined to the plane of the ecliptic CBS (for we have said that it remains equidistant from itself in all positions, and so once it is inclined to the plane of the ecliptic it will always be inclined), it nevertheless does not continue to decline from the royal road itself, that is, from the circumference of the plane of the ecliptic CBAD, once it is placed at GH.","5986":"For it does not incline forward towards A, nor back towards C, but only to the side or towards the pole, places to which its path is not directed.","5987":"So when the planet is moved forward beyond B, the other part of the axis, G, which inclines towards the south, is now in front, and it thus leads the planet from its greatest northern inclination N through the descending node A to the greatest southern inclination O.","5988":"This axis of inclination is somewhat like an oar, in that just as boatmen use oars to move from one bank to the other, the planet brings this about through the inclination of the axis,  moving it from north to south and back, while the river, that is, the immaterial species of the sun, proceeds along the direct path CBAD.","5989":"As for geometrical dimensions, there is no need for verbosity.","5990":"A straight line moved on a rectilinear course while remaining parallel to itself creates a plane through its motion.","5991":"This axis is itself a straight line, and it is moved in the direction it points (this pointing, moreover, presupposes a straight course).","5992":"It therefore describes a plane.","5993":"And if this plane be extended, it intersects the sphere of the fixed stars in the shape of a great circle, FEGH in the diagram of Chapter 13, because it intersects the plane of the ecliptic DC at the center of the world or the sun, A. To further convince yourself of this, you should consider that the points of intersection or nodes are in opposite positions about the center of the sun A, as you see in the diagram.","5994":"This is shown by experience: see Ch.","5995":"62.","5996":"And so since there is a plane in which the orbit of Mars is moved about, its inclination to the plane of the ecliptic will follow a pattern.","5997":"That is, when two equal circles are described, one, DC, in the plane of the ecliptic, and the other, FE, in the plane of Mars's orbit, about a common center A of the sun (i. e., on one and the same sphere of the fixed stars, concentric with the sun), the sine of the arc BD between the intersection of the circles and some point on Mars's circle, D say, is to the whole sine as the sine of the inclination DF of the point F is to the sine of CE, the greatest inclination, at the limit E. Furthermore, it was proved in Ch.","5998":"13 above, using an ingenious treatment of the observations, that the declinations of all the points of the circuit from the plane of the ecliptic are arranged by the same measure.","5999":"So no instance can be urged against our hypothesis.","6000":"But there are still two difficult questions to be answered.","6001":"One concerns how this declination of the axis originates, and the other concerns the axis itself.","6002":"First, is the inclination of the axis natural or rational, the work of the body's nature or of an angel?","6003":"And second, are the axis of inclination and the magnetic axis that seeks the sun the same?","6004":"And if they are different, how do they exist in the same globular planetary body?","6005":"The two questions are interrelated.","6006":"I might almost have believed it to be natural, owing to the similarity between the natural power in the magnet and this one, were it not for the successive transposition of the nodes that had also been added, which clearly seems the work of a reasoning faculty, if not discursive, at least instinctual.","6007":"For to maintain its equidistant position is less marvelous and more in accord with nature than previously in the matter of the eccentricity.","6008":"There, we said that it is the sun that is sought by the axis of power, while here, it is the position beneath the far distant fixed stars.","6009":"There, the axis was to have been turned about by the force of this magnetic power as the body is carried around, and would not remain equidistant to itself, if it were not restrained by a stronger directional force, or by an animate force, either unassisted or capable of reasoning in some manner.","6010":"Here, the axis follows these equidistant positions by the force of our directional power itself, with no need of an animate power or of reasoning.","6011":"Someone might, however, consider it the act of a mind, that the diameter that effects the latitude points directly towards the center of the sun when the planet is located at the limits, thus making a great circle of the  planet's orbit, and causing the nodes to be at opposite positions with respect to the sun.","6012":"To this argument, in Ch.","6013":"39 above, I affirmed that the planet moves with respect to the sun.","6014":"However, it is not just any kind of relationship with the sun that argues for the assistance of reason.","6015":"It is of course true that he who first ordained the heavenly motions so directed this axis as to point at the sun when at the appointed position, and did so deliberately and with perfect rationality.","6016":"But this relationship with the sun can now be maintained without a mind, by the constancy of the magnetic faculty alone.","6017":"For it is more like rest than motion, and hence is material, not mental.","6018":"Therefore, it is only the variation of this inclination which we call the translation of the nodes over the ages that still makes a case for a motive force that is more than natural, or physical, as are magnetic powers.","6019":"Nevertheless, I would prefer to think that the two must be conjoined, rather than to suppose that the rational faculty acts alone.","6020":"Let the magnetic faculty be subordinate; let the rational be in charge, ruling over it, just as we said before in Chapter 57 concerning the power of seeking the sun.","6021":"Once this question is settled, there follows the other.","6022":"If this directive power arises from magnetic, physical, natural [powers], its substrate will be a body.","6023":"Could it therefore happen that the same diameter that seeks the sun or flees from it also governs the planet's deviation from the ecliptic, by being inclined to it?","6024":"If the nodes were connected to the apsides and the limits to the middle elongations then the diameter would be the same in all respects, administering both the eccentricity and the latitude.","6025":"For it was said in Ch.","6026":"57 that the diameter that causes the eccentricity is directed towards the middle elongations, while it was just now said that the diameter that causes the latitude is directed towards the limits.","6027":"Therefore, if the limits were connected to the middle elongations, both diameters would have the same direction, and, their positions thus being in agreement, nothing would prevent their being identical.","6028":"However, the nodes, or intersections with the true ecliptic, do not coincide with the apsides.","6029":"For Mars, the northern limit is 12 degrees before the aphelion, for Jupiter, the northern limit and the aphelion coincide exactly, for Saturn, the node follows the aphelion by 24 degrees, and for the moon, owing to its short orbit, everything becomes interchanged with everything else.","6030":"For now the node is at apogee, now at the middle elongations, now at perihelion [sic].","6031":"So since these two powers differ in time and position, it follows that they are not identical.","6032":"There is, however, nothing to impede their residing in one and the same planetary body as a whole, except the motion or rotation of the globe.","6033":"Thus if the planets are moved like the moon, which does not rotate, but always shows us the same face, nothing prevents our saying that the two are interwoven, as  the weft is interwoven with the warp.","6034":"For since the entire body of the planet would then stay in the same sidereal position as it is carried about the sun, any of its rectilinear parts, among which are numbered those two diameters, will stay in the same sidereal position.","6035":"If, on the other hand, it is the earth's globe that is in question, which has a daily rotation in addition to its annual revolution, we are left in great doubt, no less than before, in Ch.","6036":"57.","6037":"For if the body rotates, only one single diameter of power, that which is parallel to the axis of its rotational motion, remains constant and equidistant from itself.","6038":"So if you were to say that in addition to that diameter, there is interwoven with it another altogether different one, a power of another sort, which causes the latitude, it will observe the same direction as the axis of rotation, since it circumscribes a cone about that axis, successively traversing each of its parts, and since it inclines, now to the right, now to the left side, it finally leads the body towards the middle position, whither the axis of rotation points.","6039":"Therefore, if the globe rotates, the subject of this declinational power is either not a body but something spiritual, or is not the same body.","6040":"If it is something spiritual, how does it look to certain regions of the world, which are corporeal?","6041":"And how does it impart this kind of motion (declination from the royal road) to the body?","6042":"Is it perhaps that the body is more easily inclined, and departs from the royal road more easily (meanwhile receiving the cause of its translational motion extrinsically, from the sun), than it is carried from place to place by the force of its own proper mover?","6043":"If, on the other hand, we prefer a corporeal subject, some mechanism will be brought into being for us, like those spherical oil lamps which, though thrown and spun around, do not spill any oil.","6044":"For within is enclosed a little flask which, being drawn down by a weight in its belly,3 and held there, does not follow the convoluted motion of the surrounding sphere.","6045":"Is there then also some interior globe within this globe of the earth, to which the diurnal motion of the earth's exterior does not penetrate, but which is held in place by a very strong inclination towards certain sidereal positions, so as not to follow the revolving exterior of the body?","6046":"For as we shall see in Chapter 68, this question pertains to the earth as well.","6047":"We shall also see there whether, if some mean ecliptic be proposed for the six planets, that which we were requiring a little earlier can be accomplished, namely, that the nodes of each of the planets correspond to the apsides.","6048":"Or is it rather to be believed that there are some possible modes of celestial motion which, though physical like the magnetic [powers], cannot be comprehended by anyone on earth owing to the lack of examples?","6049":"For if we had lacked the example of the magnet (which was indeed unknown at one time), we would have been ignorant of most of the causes of the celestial motions.","6050":"Those who believe in solid orbs can easily set everything right, following what was said in Ch.","6051":"13.","6052":"For they will attribute to the plane of Mars's eccentric FE an inclination to the plane of the ecliptic DC that does not librate, but is fixed and constant, above the diameter BA of intersection of these planes, drawn through the center of the world (the center of the sun, for Brahe), and they will say that over the ages it rotates about the center A beneath the ecliptic DC.","6053":"And since the poles (F, G and B, C in the present diagram) of two great","6054":"circles (ML and KH) are distant by an amount equal to their maximum declination MK, LH, the poles of Mars B, C will therefore describe small circles about the poles of the ecliptic F, G, with radius FB, GC, of 1\u00b0 50' 25\".","6055":"These people will also say that the poles of the Martian sphere B, C revolve forward with a motion quantitatively the same as that which was expressed above in Ch.","6056":"17, and which will be corrected below in ch 69.","6057":"Chapter 64","6058":"Examination of the parallax of Mars through the latitudes.","6059":"In Chapter 61, the two nodes were found to be at positions exactly opposed, a marvelous agreement and one which excludes all parallax.","6060":"Let it be the case that Mars's parallax is at least 1' and 2' [respectively] when at opposition to the sun (and nearer to the earth than the sun) in 1595 and 1589, and that on the former date Mars was about 38\u00b0 from the zenith, and on the latter about 66\u00b0.","6061":"Accordingly, in 1589, when it was thought to be at the node, it would still have been nearly 2' to the north.","6062":"Therefore, it would still have been one degree before the node.","6063":"So the node would be, not 16\u00b0 46' Scorpio, but 17\u00b0 46' Scorpio.","6064":"In 1595, on the other hand, it would have 1' of parallax.","6065":"Therefore, on the day on which it was thought to be at the ascending node, it would now actually have had a latitude of 1', and it would thus now have been about 30' beyond the node.","6066":"Therefore, the ascending node would be, not at 16\u00b0 46' Taurus, but at 16\u00b0 16' Taurus.","6067":"You see that the descending node is at 17\u00be\u00b0 Scorpio, and the ascending at 16\u00bc\u00b0 Taurus, if you make use even of the least parallax.","6068":"Let us therefore conclude, as in Ch.","6069":"11, that Mars's diurnal parallax is entirely imperceptible, if it is indeed true that the two observations of latitude are correct within 2'.","6070":"Another argument for no parallax, which is not dissimilar, will arise for us out of Ch.","6071":"62, premised upon the investigation of the inclination of the planes, perfectly true unless refraction will throw something off.","6072":"Let it be the case that in 1593, at an altitude of 22\u00b0, Mars had a parallax of at least 2', while in 1585, at an altitude of 53\u00b0, it had a parallax of one minute.","6073":"The observed southern latitude would therefore be smaller then the northern, and so the inclination would also be smaller.","6074":"But now, just above, without parallax, it appears somewhat smaller, by an amount attributable to a small error in observation or to a certain amount of refraction at an altitude of 23\u00b0.","6075":"Therefore, when parallax is considered, the observation would be charged with a greater error, and conversely, if the observation stands, the parallax is entirely eliminated, if it is indeed true that the orbit of Mars is contained in a perfect plane that intersects the plane of the ecliptic at the very center of the sun.","6076":"But the same is proved much more certainly from the latitudes observed at  other acronychal positions, especially those which the circumstances of observation or refraction did not render dubious.","6077":"As I began to say in Ch.","6078":"15, this matter has so far been impossible to settle ^1.","6079":"For in 1587, when Mars was 55 degrees from the zenith, if it had had a parallax of 4' its latitude of 3\u00b0 37' would have been increased to 3\u00b0 41'.","6080":"But in Chapter 62, it was found to be no greater than 3\u00b0 37' ^2.","6081":"And in 1589, when the nonagesimal was 64\u00b0 from the zenith, if Mars's parallax had been 5\u00bd (judging from the sun's horizontal parallax of 3'), then the northern latitude, instead of the observed 1\u00b0 7', would have been 1\u00b0 12\u00bd\u2019 freed of parallax ^3.","6082":"But we have computed no more than 1\u00b0 5\u2153\u2018, although a slight error of 2' could have occurred in the observation, such as if Mars at an altitude of 22\u00b0, still subject to refraction, had appeared 2' higher (to the north) than was correct, as was said in both Ch.","6083":"62 and Ch.","6084":"15 ^4.","6085":"And in 1602, when with a parallax correction the observed latitude was found to be 4\u00b0 10', and without the correction, 4\u00b0 7\u00bd\u2019, we computed 4\u00b0 7 \u2156\u2019, very precisely ^5.","6086":"Similarly in 1604 we did not agree perfectly with the observed quantity of northern latitude ^6.","6087":"Therefore, we shall complain that it is much less when it is increased through the removal of parallax.","6088":"By these three procedures, we have overcome our uncertainty about Mars's parallax.","6089":"However, we have not completely proved that it is utterly imperceptible, since the matter of refraction eludes us, and besides, the observations do not descend to within 2 or 3 minutes.","6090":"So if anyone wishes to attribute to Mars a maximum latitudinal parallax of 2 or 2\u00bd minutes, these Brahean observations do not significantly disagree with him.","6091":"For the inclination, too, will be accommodated to this view, becoming 1\u00b0 51' 0\".","6092":"Chapter 65","6093":"Investigation of the maximum latitude in both regions: in conjunction as well as opposition with the sun.","6094":"Once the inclination is established, it is easy to define the maximum latitude, and this can be done in two ways.","6095":"For one can find the maximum for all time, or how great it could be in our time.","6096":"Today the two hardly differ, since the limits are the midpoints between the apsides of Mars and of the sun or earth, and they are no more than 54 degrees from one another, and the eccentricity of the sun or earth is not great.","6097":"Nonetheless, let it be the case (as it once was) that the apsides of Mars and the sun coincide, along with the limits of Mars's latitudes.","6098":"And let the ecliptic maintain its sidereal position.","6099":"Now since, in the diagram of Ch.","6100":"13, Mars's greatest distance AC is 166,465, the sun's least distance AB is 98,200, and BAC is 1\u00b0 50\u00bd\u2019, the maximum northern latitude at opposition to the sun computed from these data is 4\u00b0 29' 10\".","6101":"At conjunction with the sun, when the sun's distance from the earth is 101,800, this is decreased to 1\u00b0 8' 34\".","6102":"But the southern latitude, from Mars's distance of 138,234, and the sun's of 101,800, is computed to be 6\u00b0 58' 24\", a little less than 7\u00b0.","6103":"At conjunction with the sun, when the sun's distance is 98,200, this is decreased to 1\u00b0 4' 36\".","6104":"If, however, one considers the contrary case, in which the sun's apogee coincides with Mars's perihelion, the maximum northern latitude at opposition comes out to be 4\u00b0 44' 12\", and at conjunction 1\u00b0 9' 32\", while the southern latitude at opposition is 6\u00b0 20' 50\", and at conjunction 1\u00b0 3' 32\".","6105":"And this is how it would be if the apsides and the limits were to coincide at some time, but whether this is going to happen before the whole fabric comes to ruin is uncertain.","6106":"It is certain that Ptolemy attributed equal motions to the apsides and nodes, and if this were so, that conjunction would never happen.","6107":"But even though today they appear to undergo different motions, the observations of the ancients are not sufficiently reliable, and the difference of these motions even in modern astronomy is not sufficiently great, for us to conclude how many myriads of years apart these conjunctions of the apsides and the limits occur.","6108":"Therefore, let us return to our era, that which extends between us and Ptolemy.","6109":"And here, one who is looking for geometrically precise determinations is presented with a manifold obstacle to computation ^1.","6110":"First, the apsides of the sun and Mars are not in conjunction, and second, the planets' orbits are not perfect circles.","6111":"So even if we project a new line of apsides through the centers of the circles of Mars and the earth (through B, C in the diagram of Chapter 52), it will still be possible for the nearest approach of the celestial bodies to occur elsewhere than on this line.","6112":"Finally, even if the position of the nearest approach were established, the position of the northern and southern limit is different.","6113":"For example, the limit is at 16\u00b0 50' Leo.","6114":"But the straight line BC projected through the centers of the circles is directed towards 24\u00bd Leo and Aquarius, approximately; in the same direction, that is, in which Brahe put his line of apsides HF, to which our line BC runs parallel, both eccentricities being bisected, AF at C, and AH at B.","6115":"And I was now about to choose the mean between 17\u00b0 Leo and 25\u00b0 Leo, namely, 21\u00b0 Leo, but the year 1585 gave me pause, since in that year the latitude observed at 21\u00b0 36' Leo was clearly not a maximum.","6116":"For while the opposition was on the night following January 30, the latitude observed on the 24th, preceding the opposition, was 4\u00b0 31', still increasing, while on January 31, 16 hours past opposition, the observed latitude was again 4\u00b0 31'.","6117":"It is therefore evident that on the 24th, if the opposition had occurred at that eccentric position, a latitude greater than 4\u00b0 31' would have been observed, for two reasons: first, because the celestial body was nearer the earth than when it was not at its acronychal position, and second, because Mars was farther from apogee, and was lower.","6118":"Therefore, let the maximum latitude occur about 19\u00b0 Leo and Aquarius, where Mars was on January 24.","6119":"And since the supplement of the equated anomaly was 10\u00b0, the distance of Mars will be 166,200, and of the sun, 98,670.","6120":"And so the maximum northern latitude will be about 4\u00b0 31\u00be\u2019 ^2.","6121":"At conjunction with the sun, since its distance is 101,280, this appears as 1\u00b0 8' 30\" ^3.","6122":"For the maximum southern latitude, Mars's equated anomaly of 170\u00b0 shows us a distance of about 138,420, and the sun at 19\u00b0 Leo has a distance of 101,280.","6123":"Hence it is concluded that the maximum southern latitude will be about 6\u00b0 52' 20\",4 and at conjunction it appears as 2\u00b0 4' 20\" ^5.","6124":"Chapter 66","6125":"The maximum excursions in latitude do not always occur at opposition to the sun.","6126":"Concerning the maximum latitude that can occur in any particular period of Mars, however, it is a much more complicated business to define its exact positions geometrically, and also involves this great paradox, which I found emphasized among the observations of 1593 in Tycho Brahe's hand, in the following words:1","6127":"\"It is worthy of consideration that on about the tenth day of August Mars had its maximum southern latitude, and that it decreased afterwards, so that at opposition on the 24th it was about one fourth of a degree nearer to the ecliptic.","6128":"However, the Canons2 do not show this at 18 Aquarius, even when the position of maximum latitude is corrected, no matter how that maximum latitude is derived there.","6129":"The cause of this needs to be looked into carefully.\"","6130":"When I later had come to him in Bohemia, and frequently inquired about how the latitudes are arranged, he answered that the nodes are at opposite positions, and the line of intersection passes through the point of the sun's mean position, or through the center of its epicycle (for which see Ch.","6131":"67 below), and enumerated many other things.","6132":"Reminded by this mention, he said, regarding the present matter, \"this is remarkable, that the latitudes reach their maximum before or after opposition to the sun.\"","6133":"Mention was also made of this above in Chapter 15.","6134":"The cause of this occurrence is in fact contained in the true hypothesis of  the latitude established in this fifth part; however, you would have almost as much trouble finding the boundaries of the maximum latitudes geometrically, as Apollonius of Perga had in finding the boundaries of the stations.","6135":"For in the business of the stations, a certain condition can be described  through which the position of the stations may be known (and that condition is this, that the line of vision of Mars, the earth being in motion, remains parallel to itself).","6136":"But the position of the stations cannot be demonstrated a priori from this condition without multiple calculations, owing to the confluence of many causes.","6137":"And matters stand just the same with the maximum latitude for any given occurrence.","6138":"For the latitude is greatest when the distance of  Mars from the earth is increasing or decreasing in the same ratio in which the lines of Mars's inclinations increase or decrease.","6139":"And the latitude is increasing when the ratio of the distance decreases more than the ratio of the lines of inclination, or when the former is decreasing while the latter, on the contrary, is increasing.","6140":"And, in turn, the latitude is decreasing either when the distance of Mars from the earth increases more than the lines of inclination, each in its own proportion, or when the distance is increasing while the lines are decreasing.","6141":"These conditions are satisfied indiscriminately, now at opposition, now before, now after, depending on whether the opposition falls at the limit, or before, or after the limit.","6142":"That these results follow from the hypothesis of this work, my ephemerides prove ^3.","6143":"In 1604, about Feb.","6144":"25 or March 6, the northern latitude was a maximum, while opposition followed by an entire month.","6145":"On Sept.","6146":"27 or October 7, in turn, the southern latitude was a maximum, while Mars was between its quintile and sextile aspects to the sun ^4.","6147":"Again, at the end of 1605 the northern latitude was maximum, while the sun was moving from quintile to quadrature with Mars.","6148":"And, in turn, at the end of July of 1606, the southern latitude was maximum when the sun was trine with Mars ^5.","6149":"But in 1607, the maximum northern latitude occurred a little after the conjunction of Mars with the sun.","6150":"The reason why these things would appear remarkable in ancient astronomy is chiefly that Ptolemy and his imitators had fabricated the extremely intricate motions of inclination, deviation and reflection ^6.","6151":"For since Ptolemy clung to his invention of the epicycle, as soon as he saw that when the planet was at opposition to the sun (and was thus visible) the epicycle went out to one side, he immediately indulged in conjecture, asserting that at conjunction with the sun, when it is not visible, the epicycle goes out in the other direction, and generally, that at conjunction the epicycle does the opposite of what he observed it to do at opposition.","6152":"This is done in order that there be some compensation and equality of return and coherence with the sun.","6153":"However, this is not discovering the true by observing, but fabricating the observations by a falsely conceived fancy.","6154":"Nevertheless, it should be condoned in him, since he had few observations.","6155":"On this subject, see Ch.","6156":"14 also ^7.","6157":"But come, let us see whether our calculation gives the observed latitude on August 10.","6158":"For we are sure of July 21 and August 25 of that year, since the calculation yields the observations upon which it is based ^8.","6159":"So, on August 10 at 13h 45m, Mars's eccentric position on the ecliptic is computed to be 2\u00b0 41' 18\" Pisces, the sun was 27\u00b0 37' 49\" Leo, the angle at the sun 5\u00b0 3' 29\", the angle at the earth 18\u00b0 25', and from the calculation Mars was at 16\u00b0 3' Pisces, while it was observed at 16\u00b0 7' Pisces ^9.","6160":"And since 2\u00b0 40\u2019 48\" Pisces, the position on the orbit, is distant from 16\u00b0 43' Taurus10 by 74\u00b0 2', the inclination will therefore be 1\u00b0 46' 10\".","6161":"From this and the two angles mentioned, using the method given in Ch.","6162":"62, the observed latitude is found to be 6\u00b0 21' 14\", still two minutes more than the observation has.","6163":"But lest the angle's small magnitude trip us up, let us use the true distances of Mars from the earth and the sun (as the method given above requires), or in their place, the true angles.","6164":"In the diagram of Chapter 20 you see that CB, BA differ from CL, LA.","6165":"And our method did not say that the sine of the angle LAB is to the sine of the angle LCB as CB is to BA, but as CL is to LA.","6166":"Let the ecliptic position be 2\u00b0 41' 18\" Pisces, Mars standing beneath the point \u03bb, and \u03ba be the position opposite the sun, 27\u00b0 37' 49\" Aquarius.","6167":"Therefore, \u03ba\u03b2 is 5\u00b0 3' 29\", and \u03b2\u03bb is 1\u00b0 46' 10\".","6168":"From this and the right angle \u03bb\u03b2\u03ba, \u03ba\u03bb or CAL is given as 5\u00b0 21' 36\", to which corresponds the true distance of Mars L from the sun A ^11.","6169":"So in triangle CAL, from the sides CA, 101,077, and AL, 138,261, and from the angle just found, let LCA be sought, which is found to be 160\u00b0 33'.","6170":"Its supplement is 19\u00b0 27', to which corresponds the true distance of Mars L from the earth C.","6171":"So now, using these angles of the operation, I find the apparent latitude LCB to be 6\u00b0 19' 10\", very nearly the same as the observed value ^12.","6172":"Thus the hypothesis established in this work shows this very thing whose cause Brahe advised was diligently to be sought, and which ancient astronomy, for all its apparatus, cannot show.","6173":"And, I would add, it shows this in all its simplicity, in that the plane of the eccentric is given a constant inclination or obliquity, and this is variously increased or diminished, not in reality, but optically only, insofar as our sighting approaches it or recedes from it, or (for Brahe and Ptolemy) it approaches or recedes from our sighting.","6174":"Chapter 67","6175":"From the positions of the nodes and the inclination of the planes of Mars and the ecliptic, it is demonstrated that the eccentricity of Mars takes its origin, not from the point of the sun's mean position (or, for Brahe, the center of the sun's epicycle), but from the very center of the sun.","6176":"The end is a reply to the beginning.","6177":"In Chapter 6, I argued on physical grounds that when solid orbs are denied, the eccentricities of the planets cannot take their origin from any point other than the very center of the sun.","6178":"I postponed part of the geometrical proof of this, based upon the observations, to Chapters 22, 23, and 52, in which places I think I have satisfied even the sharpest- eyed critic.","6179":"The other part I shall now expound.","6180":"This is done first through the positions of the nodes.","6181":"It was proven in Chapter 61 that when Mars's eccentricity is constructed from the very center of the sun, or, what is the same, using acronychal observations taken when the planet is at opposition to the sun's apparent position, the nodes fall at positions that are very precisely opposite in relation to the sun's center; that is, that the diameter of the apsides and the diameter of the intersection of the planes of the ecliptic and of Mars coincide, or intersect one another, at the same center from which the eccentricity is computed, namely, at the center of the sun.","6182":"The question now is, if we use the sun's mean motion instead of its apparent motion, will the nodes as a result still be at opposite positions about the point whence the eccentricity is computed?","6183":"Not at all.","6184":"Consider again the Copernican diagram in Chapter 6 ^1.","6185":"In it let \u03ba\u03b4 now be the line of the limits, at 16\u00be\u00b0 Leo and Aquarius (not, as in Ch.","6186":"6, the line of apsides at 29\u00b0 Leo).","6187":"Therefore, the line [NN'] drawn through \u03ba perpendicular to \u03ba\u03b4 will be the diameter of the nodes.","6188":"But if we use the mean sun instead of the apparent sun, then we are given \u03b2 instead of \u03ba as the point from which the eccentricity is reckoned.","6189":"So from \u03b2 let \u03b2\u03c2 be drawn perpendicular to \u03ba\u03b4 [and extended to PP'].","6190":"This will fall at positions exactly opposite about \u03b2, but will not fall at the positions of the nodes, because the former perpendicular [NN'] through \u03ba, falling at the  positions of the nodes, is above \u03b2\u03c2 by the distance \u03ba\u03c2.","6191":"It is desirable to enquire into the magnitude of the angles at the circumference of the eccentric when the point \u03ba is connected to the points of intersection of the line \u03b2\u03c2 with the circumference of the eccentric.","6192":"Since, by supposition, \u03c2\u03ba is at 16\u00b0 45' Leo, and \u03b2\u03ba is at about 5\u00b0 45' Cancer, the angle \u03b2\u03ba\u03c2 will be 41\u00b0; and since \u03b2\u03c2\u03ba is right, \u03ba\u03b2\u03c2 will be 49\u00b0.","6193":"And since \u03ba\u03b2 is the sun's eccentricity, 3600, where the orb of the earth or the sun is 100,000, therefore, as the whole sine of the angle \u03c2 is to \u03b2\u03ba, 3600, so is the sine of angle \u03b2 to \u03ba\u03c2, 2717.","6194":"And in the same units (where the semidiameter of the earth\u2019s orb is 100,000), the semidiameter of Mars's orb, from Ch.","6195":"54, is 152,350.","6196":"Therefore, where the semidiameter of Mars's orb is 100,000, \u03ba\u03c2 will be 1790, showing an angle of 1\u00b0 1' 33\" in the [table of] sines.","6197":"The ascending node [P'] should therefore have been moved backward, and the descending node [P] moved forward, by that number of degrees, minutes, and seconds, if I had been mistaken in taking the sun's center \u03ba instead of the Ptolemaic, Copernican, and Brahean point \u03b2. But in turn, where the observations are referred to the mean sun, and thus the point \u03b2 is taken, if this is done in error, and \u03ba should have been chosen instead, the ascending node [\u039d'] found from \u03b2 should be in a place farther forward, and the descending node [N] farther back, so as to shorten the northern semicircle [N\u2019\u03b7N] by an arc of 2\u00b0 3' 6\".","6198":"Let us see whether it happens in this way.","6199":"In the observations of Chapter 12, considered approximately, on 1595 October 28 Mars was considered to have been at the node ^2.","6200":"From the Brahean equations, which rely on the point \u03b2, its eccentric position was found to be 16\u00b0 48' Taurus.","6201":"And on the morning of 1589 May 9 we supposed Mars to have been at the other, descending, node ^3.","6202":"Using the same Brahean equations, we computed Mars's eccentric position to be 15\u00b0 44\u00bd\u2019 Scorpio at that time.","6203":"So what I said should happen, does happen: there are 1 degree and 3\u00bd minutes less in the northern semicircle.","6204":"If the observations are treated more accurately, as in Ch.","6205":"61, Mars arrives at the ascending node one day and 15 hours late.","6206":"Therefore, about 50 minutes are added to the eccentric position, so that the planet falls at 17\u00b0 38' Taurus, in its eccentric motion.","6207":"Accordingly, the abbreviation of the upper semicircle is 1\u00b0 53\u00bd\u2019, virtually equal to the computed value of 2\u00b0 3'.","6208":"Therefore, the point \u03ba is entirely confirmed, and \u03b2 is rejected.","6209":"For why will the diameter of the intersection of the planes not intersect the diameter of the apsides in the center from which the eccentricity originates, as above?","6210":"What would be the cause of such a thing?","6211":"The same is also demonstrated through the inclination of the planes demonstrated in Ch.","6212":"62, using the diagram of Chapter 20.","6213":"The inclination, that is, the angle LAB under which the digression of the northern limit appears when seen from the sun A, was there found to be 1\u00b0 50' 45\".","6214":"But the angle MAD, under which the southern limit's digression from the ecliptic appears when viewed from the sun A, was found to be nearly equal to it, namely, 1\u00b0 50' 8\".","6215":"So the angles at A, above and below, are equal, and the line drawn from A to the ecliptic positions of the limits B, D, is one line (since it is in the one plane of the ecliptic).","6216":"It was therefore concluded from this that the other line, drawn from A to the limits themselves L, M, is also one line; and further, that what is enclosed within the orbit of Mars is a single plane.","6217":"Furthermore, if the common intersection of the planes were not at \u03ba in the former diagram (which is A in the present one), but at \u03b2\u03c2 (that is, below A in the present diagram), when the limits L, M are connected with some point on the line BD below A, the angle under which LB appears from that point would be smaller, and the angle under which MD appears would be larger, by about two minutes.","6218":"It is true that if we are allowed the liberty of making the parallax as great as we please, the arguments of this chapter are easily weakened.","6219":"But it is a well- documented certainty that it is impossible to allow a parallax great enough to fully enervate this demonstration.","6220":"Also, since the point of this chapter was demonstrated most soundly in Ch.","6221":"52, I could take another tack, and instead of demonstrating this point by denying parallax, I could deny parallax, as in Ch.","6222":"64, by maintaining this point, which has its own demonstration in Ch.","6223":"52.","6224":"It does not matter which way you do it.","6225":"For both points have other demonstrations.","6226":"The present way occurred to me first, and suited my purpose of showing how everything is in agreement.","6227":"Chapter 68","6228":"Whether the inclinations of the planes of Mars and the ecliptic are the same in our time and in Ptolemy\u2019s.","6229":"Also, on the latitudes of the ecliptic and the nonuniform circuit of the nodes.","6230":"It was said in Chapter 14 that in any one period of Mars whatever, the obliquity\nor inclination of Mars's plane to the plane of the ecliptic remains fixed.","6231":"There\nis, however, some doubt whether this obliquity is the same, and fixed, for all\nages.","6232":"The reason for the doubt is this.","6233":"In the first volume of the Progymnastica, p.","6234":"233,1 Brahe demonstrated that  the latitudes of the fixed stars are different today than at the time of Ptolemy, the difference being this: that in the region of the summer solstice, the latitudes of the northern stars increased and those of the southern stars decreased; and, in turn, in the region of the winter solstice, the latitudes of the northern stars decreased and those of the southern stars increased.","6235":"As one goes from these boundaries towards the equinox points, the alteration of the latitudes diminishes, until near the equinox points there is none at all.","6236":"This observation of our time we shall accommodate to our principles laid down in Ch.","6237":"63, thus:","6238":"It is established that the sphere of the fixed stars is raised above the planets by an immense interval, and it is accordingly not affected by those motions that in the planets.","6239":"Copernicus puts the matter very simply: the fixed stars is raised above the planets by an immense interval, and it is accordingly not affected by those motions that in the planets.","6240":"Copernicus puts the matter very simply: the fixed stars are not subject to any motion from place to place, and thus are truly fixed  forever in the same places.","6241":"The ecliptic, in turn, is the great circle in the sphere of the fixed stars beneath which, for us on earth, the sun ever appears, and which it is seen to traverse annually.","6242":"And whether this motion belongs to the sun or the earth, in either case it belongs to one of the planets.","6243":"Therefore, the fixed stars do not themselves contain the cause of the ecliptic: it only results from the annual motion of the earth or of the sun about the center of the world.","6244":"Thus, since the ecliptic is found to have changed its position with respect to  the fixed stars, it is not the fixed stars that have moved away from the ecliptic, but the latter that has moved away from the fixed stars.","6245":"The reason for this translation is shown beyond doubt by our principles  of Chapter 63, if, indeed, they are sound.","6246":"Since the sun, through its most rapid rotation in its space which, for Copernicus, is the center of the world, sets the planets in motion through an emitted species, this rotation will have determinate poles.","6247":"In the last diagram of Chapter 63, let the body of the sun be IO, and the poles of rotation  be A, E, above which stand the points F, G on the sphere of the fixed stars.","6248":"The great circle IO of the rotating solar body will thus be arranged beneath some great circle of the fixed stars: let this be ML.","6249":"This is doubtless one and the same circle beneath the fixed stars, the poles F and G remaining constant, and the dignity of its body declaring that it first instils motion into the others.","6250":"Nevertheless, the planets are found to move on various circles that are inclined to one another, owing to the natural principles explained in Chapter 63.","6251":"Therefore, beyond doubt, the various circles of all the planets depend upon this \"royal circle\" ML, described by the rotation of the solar body about its axis AE, and each of them will keep its inclination to this circle constant in quantity, though having a translational motion, since we know by experience that the nodes are transposed.","6252":"Since the ecliptic, too, is one of the planetary circles, either the sun's or the earth's, it is consistent for it, too, to have some inclination to the royal circle ML, described among the fixed stars by the great circle IO of the solar body.","6253":"For what would be the reason why the other planets would decline from one another, while the ecliptic alone, standing above the solar or the terrestrial path, coincides exactly with this royal circle ML?","6254":"Let this therefore be granted: that the ecliptic, properly so called, is inclined to the royal solar circle.","6255":"Let it be represented to us by the circle KH drawn among the fixed stars, and let its poles be BC.","6256":"Under these conditions, we easily discover the occasion of the alteration of the fixed stars' latitudes: as the name suggests, these are computed from the true ecliptic and not from that royal solar circle, hitherto unknown.","6257":"For the intersections or common nodes of the ecliptic, truly and properly so called (as a result of eclipses' occurring only beneath that line along which the sun proceeds), with the circle ML, which we might call the \"mean ecliptic\", will be carried along no less than the nodes of the other planets.","6258":"Nevertheless, the maximum obliquity MK or LH, which is measured by the distance of the poles FB, GC, remains fixed and constant, as in the  rest of the planets.","6259":"That is, if about centers F, G, with constant radii FB, GC, small circles be described upon which we suppose the poles of the ecliptic B, C, to revolve, then the circle KH as well will depart from its original position on the sphere of the fixed stars FMG, and over the ages will make the southern limit come to be near the same fixed stars where the northern limit once was.","6260":"Over a shorter period, however, it will be as follows.","6261":"Since the limits K, H have not moved far from their fixed stars, their latitudes will be changed by some imperceptible quantity.","6262":"However, since the nodes have progressed by the same amount from their fixed stars, the latitudes of their fixed stars will be altered more evidently.","6263":"This is because at the end of the quadrant, near the limit, the sines of the inclinations increase by imperceptible increments, while at the beginning, near the nodes, these increments are quite perceptible.","6264":"Hence, because no change in the latitudes of the fixed stars is perceived near the equinoxes, while it is noticeable enough near the solstices, we correctly conclude that the limits of the ecliptic's latitudes are near the equinoxes, and the nodes are near the solstices.","6265":"Therefore, the points K, H will be near the equinoxes.","6266":"We likewise  conclude this: that since the northern part of the true ecliptic flees from the north, in that the northern latitudes are increasing in Gemini and Cancer, the ecliptic's northern limit is therefore either in Libra, if the nodes progress, or in Aries, if (as is more probable) they retrogress.","6267":"For the moon's nodes also retrogress, traversing the zodiac in 19 years, while the apogee progresses, traversing it in 8\u00bd years.","6268":"Now the sun's apogee, or the earth's perihelion, is at 5\u00bd\u00b0 Cancer, and thus by Chapter 57, the diameter of power, causing the eccentricity, points at the sun when the earth is at 5\u00bd\u00b0 Aries.","6269":"But also, by Chapter 63, the diameter of power that causes the latitude points at the sun when the earth is at the limit, which is in Aries by the present Chapter 68.","6270":"Therefore, by the same Chapter 63, both powers can be effected by the same diameter of the earth's body.","6271":"Hence one may argue plausibly that this invisible circle or mean ecliptic and the true one known to us coincide at 5\u00bd\u00b0 Cancer and Capricorn.","6272":"If the aphelia of all the planets were arranged on a single great circle, we  could say that this is what we are seeking.","6273":"For then it could be true of all planets, as it is here in the earth's circuits, that the nodes coincide with the apsides, and thus both variations\u2014that of the eccentricity (in height) and that of the the obliquity (in latitude)\u2014are effected by the same diameter of power.","6274":"This would free us from the great difficulties with which we were left in Chapter 63.","6275":"And in fact the apogees of the sun, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn fit approximately.","6276":"For the aphelia of all three superior planets are in the same semicircle, and at the same time in the same northern direction.","6277":"Therefore, the southern limit of the true ecliptic would be in Libra, and the northern in Aries, which agrees with the above.","6278":"A full consideration of this question must, however, be deferred until the motions of all the planets are examined with reference to the true ecliptic, the one known to us.","6279":"Further confirmation of this opinion of a hidden royal circle, projected  from the sun among the fixed stars, is provided by the obliquity of the ecliptic that is in common use, which is computed from the equator, but which we  might more correctly call the equator's latitude from the ecliptic.","6280":"Now the  equator is the great circle of the earth's body that is intermediate between the poles of the earth's daily rotation on its axis.","6281":"And the same name of \"equator\" or \"equinoctial\" is given to that region of the sphere of the fixed stars that stands above the terrestrial equator in any era.","6282":"The same name of \"poles\" is given to the points of the fixed stars that stand above the earth's poles in any era.","6283":"Hence this axis, and this great circle, are inclined to the ecliptic differently in different eras.","6284":"For to the extent that the northern latitude of the fixed stars in Cancer, and the southern latitude in Capricorn, is greater today, the equator's latitude from the ecliptic is smaller than it was once, since this obliquity is greatest in Cancer and Capricorn.","6285":"It was once 23\u00b0 51\u00bd\u2019, while today it is 23\u00b0 31\u00bd\u2019, the difference of 20' being the change in latitude of the fixed stars.","6286":"It is, however, reasonable to suppose that the circle of the equator with its axis and poles would forever decline from the poles of this ecliptic HK by an equal and fixed distance, if the true ecliptic were the world's primary circle.","6287":"But the ecliptic has changed, and the inclination of this axis to the ecliptic (and with it the inclination of the equator, to which this axis belongs) has been altered, so that to the extent that the ecliptic has receded from the fixed stars in Cancer, it has approached the equator.","6288":"Therefore, the equator appears to maintain a constant inclination to some other circle.","6289":"So a great cause, and a great dignity, ought to belong to this hidden circle.","6290":"And thus from all these plausible arguments there arises a royal circle LOM, middle among the circles of the planets, to which all the planets, and Mars with them, maintain a constant inclination.","6291":"The example of the moon should not trouble us, whose inclination to the ecliptic, but not to any other great circle, is a constant 5\u00b0, both in the past and today, even though the ecliptic has been moved.","6292":"For there is an enormous difference between the moon and the other planets.","6293":"The orbs of the others encircle the center of the world.","6294":"The moon's orb alone (roughly speaking) is outside the center and is transported from place to place.","6295":"The others in common circle the sun, while the moon circles the earth.","6296":"The eccentricities of the others and the whole theory of longitude and latitude originate from the sun, while those of the moon originate from the moving earth.","6297":"The sun sweeps the others around in a circle, while the earth so moves the moon.","6298":"What wonder, then, if the moon keeps the limits of its latitude constant with respect to the changeable ecliptic HK, beneath which lies the terrestrial circle, while the other planets do so with respect to some other invariable circle, such as LOIM?","6299":"So the moon should not prevent us from giving credence to this theory.","6300":"It is therefore granted that Mars's orbit is inclined at a constant angle to some circle that maintains its position beneath the same fixed stars, such as  LOIM.","6301":"It follows that this same orbit of Mars has different inclinations to the ecliptic HK in different ages, since in certain of its parts it leaves the fixed stars it originally lay beneath and moves on to others.","6302":"This only follows, however, if we grant that the nodes of Mars and the nodes of the earth, that is, the intersections of these orbits with the invisible circle LOIM, are not always carried over the same intervals in the heavens, some being faster than others.","6303":"An authentic example of this was just given.","6304":"For since the equator maintains a constant inclination to this invisible circle LOIM, while the ecliptic is meanwhile moved, the declination of the equator from the ecliptic is consequently perceived to be changeable.","6305":"Let A be the pole of the mean ecliptic, or the point upon which the straight line falls that is drawn from the center of the sun through the pole of the solar body.","6306":"About center A with radius AB of 23\u00b0 42' (or thereabouts) let a smaller circle be described, and let B, C be the positions of the north pole of the world, or the points upon which falls a line from the center of the earth's body through the pole of the daily rotation on the same body, B at the time of Ptolemy, and C at our time.","6307":"If the nodes of the ecliptic also retrogress, the northern limit must be placed near the fixed stars in the region of Aries and Pisces.","6308":"For the northern latitude of the fixed stars in Gemini and Cancer has increased, as was previously said.","6309":"Let the midpoint D between B and C be taken, marking the position of the pole of the equator at an intermediate time, and let AD be joined.","6310":"Thus the circle AD extended will pass through the solstice of the intermediate time.","6311":"From A at right angles to AD let AE be drawn, which, being  extended, will pass through the vernal equinox of the intermediate time.","6312":"Therefore, close to the line AE there would be the pole of the circle beneath which the orbit and circuit of the earth was once arranged.","6313":"And because the northern limit is in Aries, let EA be extended in the direction of A, and let the point I be taken on the extension below A. Thus the Ptolemaic pole of the ecliptic would be at I. About center A with radius AI let a small circle be described, on which let another point O be taken, nearer to C than I is to B. And let O be the present pole of the ecliptic, 23\u00b0 31\u00bd\u2019 from C, while I, the Ptolemaic pole of the ecliptic, is 23\u00b0 51\u00bd\u2019 from B. This will be the theory of the ecliptic's altered obliquity and of the altered latitude of the fixed stars, except that the size of the small circle OI is not known to us.","6314":"For the ecliptic's 20' alteration of obliquity can be produced in various ways.","6315":"And because O is today's pole of the ecliptic, and OC points towards the beginning of Cancer, let CP be the eighth part of the circle, and P the middle of Leo, where the northern limit of Mars is today.","6316":"Let PO be extended beyond O, and let GI be drawn through I nearly parallel to PO, but slanting somewhat forward in longitude (for the sidereal position of Mars's limit was once a little farther forward than today), and let it be extended beyond I. And about A let a small circle be described, intersecting PO at F and GI at H. Let the size of the circle be sufficient to make OF greater than IH.","6317":"And let the pole of the circle beneath which the circuit of Mars is arranged, be placed at F today, and at H in the past.","6318":"Today\u2019s obliquity OF, or the inclination of the plane of Mars to the ecliptic, will be greater, and the Ptolemaic obliquity HI will be smaller.","6319":"Nevertheless the pole of Mars\u2019s orbit H, F would have moved from H to F keeping at a constant distance AH, AF from A.\nAnd since the pole of the Martian orbit has traversed a fairly large arc from H to F, whether forward or backward, but at the same time the pole of the ecliptic has gone from I to O about the same point A, the pole of Mars would appear to be nearly at rest, since IH and OF are nearly parallel.","6320":"A great inequality in the motion of the nodes must indeed follow if it is true  that the poles of the individual planets circle some common pole in different times.","6321":"For there is an anomaly originating from this source in the precession of  the equinoxes, whose treatment is very much like the present ones.","6322":"I have stated what is in agreement with the principles established in this work, and by what hypotheses this can be brought about, so that the inclinations of the planes can be made different in different ages.","6323":"Let us now examine the observations of Ptolemy.","6324":"For since the northern latitude of Mars is with Cor Leonis, a northern star, while the southern latitude is with the southern stars of Capricorn, it is reasonable that the same happened to Mars's maximum latitudes as happened to those stars: they both increased.","6325":"For the stars' latitudes did increase, the northern ones around the summer solstice, and the southern ones around the winter solstice.","6326":"Ptolemy therefore said that Mars's maximum observed northern latitude was 4\u00b0 20', while today it is 4\u00b0 32' ^2.","6327":"This confirms our opinion, since he shows a maximum latitude that is 12' smaller than today's, while the nodes stayed at approximately the same distance from aphelion as they are today.","6328":"On the other hand, he makes the southern latitude about 7\u00b0, while today it could also be that much, namely, 6\u00b0 52\u2153\u2018.","6329":"We are therefore left undecided by his observations.","6330":"For concerning those 12' in the northern latitude, it should be noted that the smallest graduations on his instruments were 10 minutes, and that he usually supposed an error amounting to one of these parts.","6331":"Also, the difference between the Greek symbols for 20' and 40' is very small and slippery, often neglected by translators ^3.","6332":"Nevertheless, the Arabic says 20' here.","6333":"There is nothing besides this in Ptolemy that can lead us to a judgement of how these matters stood in antiquity.","6334":"For the observation examined in the following Chapter 69 is shown to be in error.","6335":"Therefore, as long as we are wanting suitable observations from antiquity, circumstances compel us to leave this discussion of the motion of the nodes, along with many other matters, to posterity, if, indeed, it should please God to vouchsafe the human race a length of time in this world sufficient to work through such remaining questions thoroughly.","6336":"Chapter 69","6337":"A consideration of three Ptolemaic observations, and the correction of the mean motion and of the motion of the aphelion and nodes.","6338":"1","6339":"From all antiquity, there have survived no more than five written observations of the star Mars, as well as one of extreme antiquity noted by Aristotle, who saw Mars occulted by the dark part of the half moon.","6340":"However, neither the year nor the time of day were given.","6341":"Nevertheless, I have discovered, using a very lengthy process of induction extending over the 50 years from Aristotle's fifteenth year to the end of his life, that this could not have happened on any other day than the evening of April 4 in the 357th year before the commonly accepted epoch of Christ, when the 21-year-old Aristotle was, as we know from Diogenes Laertius, a student of Eudoxus ^2.","6342":"The second observation, obtained from the Chaldeans, was preserved for us by Ptolemy.","6343":"This was made  on the morning of January 18, 272 BC, when Mars occulted the northern star in the head of Scorpius ^3.","6344":"Here again, no particular time was given.","6345":"The other four were by Ptolemy himself, using an astrolabe to measure Mars's distance from fixed stars.","6346":"However, he reports only the zodiacal position at the exact moment of Mars's opposition to the sun's mean motion ^4.","6347":"Upon these few observations, arguments of the greatest moment are to be founded; or, if this is not possible, astronomy must remain incomplete.","6348":"First, through the four Ptolemaic observations, the epoch of the mean motions, related to the fixed stars, belonging to Ptolemy's time, is to be found, and by a comparison of this with the modern data the mean motion itself is to be determined.","6349":"Next, it seems possible to use the Chaldean observation to inquire whether the solar eccentricity was really once greater than it is today.","6350":"And then, using both this observation and the Aristotelian one, if the time were known, one could hazard a guess at Mars's latitude at those times.","6351":"But by God immortal, what is this path upon which we shall be treading?","6352":"For we have hardly anything from Ptolemy that we could not with good reason call into question prior to its becoming of use to us in arriving at the requisite degree of accuracy.","6353":"I","6354":"First, at the times set out, he records the mean position of the sun by a calculation that depends upon observation of the equinoxes and solstices.","6355":"The sun reveals the beginning of Aries, not by pointing a finger at the place, but by a blind conjecture of the time.","6356":"For we call the beginning of Aries that point that the sun occupies when the day is observed to equal the nights.","6357":"What if Ptolemy had been in error as to the time?","6358":"We are not wanting conjectures.","6359":"First, he does not give his method of observing it.","6360":"My hope is that he observed the meridian altitudes, for by induction from these the moment of the sun's entering the northern hemisphere is obtained without error.","6361":"But what if he had observed it using Alexandrian armillaries, where refraction could have put him off?","6362":"He himself clearly suggests that he did so, when he says that the equinox was measured twice on the same day using these armillaries.","6363":"He ascribes this to instrumental error; I, however, suspect that the error arose from refraction ^5.","6364":"Let it stand, however: let him have observed it through meridian altitudes.","6365":"There is another suspicion that unwelcomely but most forcefully insinuates itself: the moments of the equinoxes recorded by Ptolemy do not agree within a day and a half when compared with the previous observations of Hipparchus and the later ones of Albategnius6 and Brahe, all of which conspire in a single equality.","6366":"The Ptolemaic equinoxes alone deviate.","6367":"This fact has given rise to many extremely complicated opinions on the heavens, and gave birth to the motions of trepidation and libration, all of which are brought to ruin once one sees that the observations after Ptolemy always agree to the point of equality with the most ancient ones of Hipparchus.","6368":"Ptolemy nevertheless supports himself by comparing the vernal equinoxes with the autumnal.","6369":"For if, as a result of instrumental error, he had pronounced the true equinox to be on the following day, when it had occurred on the  previous one, the autumnal equinox would have been pronounced to be on the previous day when it belonged on the following one.","6370":"If two days were thus subtracted from the length of the summer, a great alteration in the sun's eccentricity would have resulted.","6371":"Nevertheless, following his observations, he left this at the same quantity found by Hipparchus.","6372":"So no alternative is left us but to trust Ptolemy in believing him to have observed correctly the time at which the sun stood at the beginning of Aries.","6373":"II","6374":"Once a beginning is made, and the obliquity of the ecliptic is found through  observation, it is a trivial matter to use the sun's declinations on each day to report its elongation from the point occupied by the sun at the time stated to be the moment of the equinox, whatever it might be or in whichever sphere it might be established.","6375":"For various authors thought up a variety of spheres for this purpose: after the eighth and ninth spheres established by Ptolemy,  others have set up a tenth, and most recent authors an eleventh and a twelfth, all through the merest of speculations, against which overabundance of mechanisms7 Brahe vehemently inveighed.","6376":"He never, however, told me what he intended to substitute in their place, nor did he leave it in writing anywhere.","6377":"Copernicus, on the other hand, acted ingeniously and wittily (in the common  opinion), and wisely (in mine), in removing his eyes from the heavens and seeking that point in the globe of the earth, above which, in the sphere of the fixed stars, there stands a point, determinate for any age you please, as was said in Ch.","6378":"68.","6379":"However, this is not the place to discuss this matter further.","6380":"III","6381":"There follows a demonstration of the equation, which depends upon the sun's  observed entry into the beginnings of the cardinal signs.","6382":"For when the equation is subtracted from or added to the sun's apparent position, the sun's mean motion is established with respect to the point which the sun is observed to occupy at the time of the equinox.","6383":"Here too, as to the quantity of the equation, there is greater uncertainty than before over the equinox or the beginning of the zodiac.","6384":"For today that equation appears to be 20' less than the quantity which Hipparchus appears to have demonstrated for himself, and which Ptolemy retained.","6385":"Nor is there sufficiently good reason why we should say that the ratio of the orbs is different today from what it once was.","6386":"For affirmations of the greatest moment require the most solid evidence, and this we are lacking.","6387":"And those observations cannot be that accurate, especially concerning the entry into Cancer and Capricorn.","6388":"If we substitute the modern equations for Ptolemy's, we shall not change his observations as much as Ptolemy himself says he can discern in observing, nor as much as the Ptolemaic observations can be vitiated by the matter of refraction.","6389":"For we can with  certainty name the day of the Ptolemaic equinox observation, though meanwhile remaining uncertain about the time of day.","6390":"And here, the partnership of the vernal and autumnal equinoxes is no such defense against the small error we are considering here as it was before against a large one.","6391":"That the equations of Ptolemy's day were really equal to ours, the constancy of the modern ones argues.","6392":"For those found today by Brahe, and those found several centuries ago by Albategnius and Arzachel,8 are nearly the same.","6393":"There is therefore suspicion that the equation of the sun used by Ptolemy is in error, since it is deduced from erroneous apparent positions of the sun.","6394":"Consequently, Ptolemy did not relate Mars to either the sun's mean or its apparent position, without the chance of error.","6395":"Nevertheless, there is this consolation, that we need to make use of the sun's apparent position, the comprehensive argument for which was given above.","6396":"We can, however, proceed on a twofold path: either we believe Ptolemy on the equinoxes, or, using the modern equations, we apply a correction to the Ptolemaic equinoxes, making the vernal equinox three hours later than that noted by Ptolemy, and the autumnal earlier by the same amount, the result being an error of 8' in the sun's declination at each place.","6397":"Ptolemy's instruments were doubtless not calibrated with divisions any finer than 10'.","6398":"And Hipparchus assigns an uncertainty of one such division.","6399":"For this reason, the times, too, that the sun takes to traverse the quadrants of the zodiac, were not expressed more precisely than to within a quarter of a day.","6400":"So much for the true length of summer and winter.","6401":"IV","6402":"But what shall we now say of the sun's entry into Cancer and Capricorn, upon which the apogee and the setting out of the equations depends?","6403":"And of how easily a quarter of a day can diminish the vernal quadrant of the zodiac, and increase the autumnal?","6404":"For the sun's entry into Cancer is quite imperceptible.","6405":"Nor can I be persuaded that Hipparchus and Ptolemy examined the very moment of this entry, ignoring the intermediate points.","6406":"I find it more credible that throughout the summer they were carefully noting the sun's declinations, and were matching up the equal ones on both sides of the solstice, taking as the true entry of the sun into Cancer the time intermediate between the moments of equal declinations.","6407":"In this way, if a comparison had been made of positions near to the solstice, there would indeed be little error, but there still could have occurred as much as a quarter of a day, during which time 15' of the sun's motion elapse.","6408":"Therefore, even if the equinoxes were perfectly certain, it is nonetheless possible that there be an excess or defect of a quarter of a degree in the sun's position in the two segments about the solstice, and that the apogee should then fall eight degrees farther forward or farther back.","6409":"So much for the sun's motion.","6410":"V","6411":"Now, as for the observations of Mars itself, even if Ptolemy in fact managed to line the astrolabe up accurately on the fixed stars, there is still clearly no more certainty about Mars's zodiacal position (just as in the previous consideration of the sun's position) than there is about the positions of our fixed stars.","6412":"If Ptolemy committed an error in assigning a fixed star its degree of elongation from the point of the equinox, the same error will be committed in proclaiming the position of Mars.","6413":"Furthermore, not even the elongation of the fixed  stars from the sun (and thus from the point of Aries from which the sun's elongation is known through its declination) is free from suspicion of error.","6414":"For consider both the manner in which it is found and the argument of error.","6415":"In the year 2 of Antonine Ptolemy sought it through the half-illuminated moon ^9.","6416":"Using the astrolabe, he found the moon's elongation from the sun, and that of Cor Leonis from the moon.","6417":"Therefore, when the sun's elongation  from the point of the equinox is given, the elongation of the fixed star from the same point is also given*.","6418":"Now, in measuring the elongation of the moon from the sun, an error of half a degree appears to have been committed.","6419":"For the measurement was made at sunset.","6420":"But the sun when setting appears through refraction higher than it should by about half a degree.","6421":"Therefore, the moon's elongation appears less than it should, and so also that of Cor Leonis from the sun, and likewise from the equinoctial.","6422":"Thus it appears that half a degree must be added to the positions of the fixed stars at the time of Ptolemy.","6423":"Therefore, when Ptolemy considered Mars (when observed in relation to the fixed stars) to be at opposition to the sun's mean position, it would now really have been half a degree beyond this opposition.","6424":"So when these four observed positions of Mars are presented by Ptolemy: 21\u00b0 0' Gemini, 28\u00b0 50' Leo, 2\u00b0 34' Sagittarius, 1\u00b0 36' Sagittarius; we should take these: 21\u00b0 30' Gemini, 29\u00b0 20' Leo, 3\u00b0 4' Sagittarius, 2\u00b0 6' Sagittarius.","6425":"Now Ptolemy actually defended himself against such presumption, affirming that he frequently had sought out this one thing, namely, the elongation of the fixed stars from the moon, of the  moon from the sun, and hence the distance of the fixed stars from the sun and from the equinox point, and had always found it to be the same.","6426":"So although he produced only one observation in order to demonstrate the method, it is nonetheless credible that he consulted several observations, at both the rising and the setting of the sun or moon, finally choosing the one which he saw to be intermediate among many operations that produced various positions.","6427":"Now this argument over 30' seems to be irrelevant to Mars's mean  motion, if indeed on these four occasions Mars, as it was observed with respect to the fixed stars, can be referred to them, without consideration of the equinox point, whose distance is uncertain.","6428":"This is the method I used in Ch.","6429":"17 above to investigate the position of the aphelion in Ptolemy's times.","6430":"We are nevertheless hindered in this respect, that the observed positions of Mars are to be referred to a point opposite the sun's apparent position.","6431":"This task can never proceed correctly unless the distances of both Mars and the sun from the common equinox point is previously known, since the arc of the true elongations of Mars from the sun cannot be deduced otherwise than through these components (so to speak).","6432":"If, at the moment taken as the true opposition of the bodies, the planet should appear to be 30' beyond the sun's true positions, the planet still has some involvement with the second inequality, and is not yet ready for an enquiry into the first inequality.","6433":"And at apogee, these 30' in the equation of the orb occupy a large arc on the eccentric, to which corresponds an even larger portion of the time or the mean motion.","6434":"At perigee the opposite takes place.","6435":"For this equation of the center occupies a small arc on the eccentric, to which corresponds an even smaller portion of the mean motion.","6436":"Therefore, anyone who says that on these four occasions Mars was observed 30' farther along on the zodiac, says in effect that at the equinoctial point Mars's mean motion was many minutes farther back at apogee, and a few minutes back at perigee.","6437":"And since the arc on the eccentric is smaller than this 30' arc resulting from faulty observation, neither Mars's eccentric position nor even its sidereal position are as far forward as Mars itself appears to have moved with respect to the fixed stars, the difference being that quantity by which the arc on the eccentric differs from the 30' arc in the observation.","6438":"And since this arc is large at aphelion, differing but little from the 30' arc in the observation, and the  opposite at perigee, it therefore finally will follow that at aphelion a small amount, and at perihelion more, must be subtracted from Mars's mean motion with respect to the fixed stars, if we accept that the fixed stars are 30' farther forward on the zodiac.","6439":"Thus not only is the mean motion made smaller (although by a much smaller quantity than the 30' resulting from faulty observation), but also the arrangement of the three acronychal observations used by Ptolemy is disturbed, whence must arise another aphelion and another eccentricity.","6440":"However, this will cause us no trouble later.","6441":"For we may neglect it, even if the observations introduce something large, as long as there is no suspicion of error in the fixed stars, since it is certain that they do not have the same precision as the Brahean ones.","6442":"So we shall use the form of equation found through the Brahean observations, as if they remain the same throughout the ages.","6443":"Since we have encountered three forks in the road, one concerning the sun's eccentricity, another concerning the position of the sun's apogee, and the third concerning the zodiacal positions of the fixed stars and of Mars, there are therefore eight ways of establishing the mean motions and the aphelion at the moments of observation, even if, ignoring the zodiac, we compute only with reference to the fixed stars.","6444":"Let the first investigation retain all the Ptolemaic data concerning the sun and the fixed stars.","6445":"Since the positions of the sun's mean motion were 21\u00b0 0' Sagittarius, 28\u00b0 50' Aquarius, and 2\u00b0 34' Gemini, and the sun's apogee was 5\u00b0 30' Gemini, the apparent positions of the sun were 21\u00b0 40' Sagittarius, 1\u00b0 13' Pisces, and 2\u00b0 41' Gemini, all three beyond opposition ^10.","6446":"The true opposition therefore precede them.","6447":"And since the diurnal motion at 21\u00b0 Gemini (Cancer, today) is about 23', and that of the sun, 61', and the sum is 1\u00b0 24', those 41' therefore require 8 hours,11 at which time Mars was visible at 21\u00b0 8' Gemini, opposite the sun's apparent position.","6448":"Likewise, at 29\u00b0 Leo (Virgo, today) Mars's diurnal motion is usually taken to be 24', the sun's diurnal motion 59', and the sum 1\u00b0 23'.","6449":"Therefore, a difference of 2\u00b0 23' requires 1 day 17 hours 21 minutes, at which time Mars was visible at 29\u00b0 31' Leo.","6450":"Finally, at 3\u00b0 Gemini (Cancer, today) Mars's diurnal motion is 23', the sun's 57', the sum 1\u00b0 20', by which it is shown that for 7' there are required 2h 6m, at which time Mars was visible at 2\u00b0 36' Sagittarius.","6451":"12 13 14","6452":"To the first interval there corresponds a mean sidereal motion of 80\u00b0 57' 14\" beyond the complete cycles, and to the second, 96\u00b0 16' 24\".","6453":"But in the former instance the apparent motion of Mars was 68\u00b0 21' 20\" beyond the complete cycles, with precession over the interval subtracted, in the amount that it was at that time ^15.","6454":"In the latter instance, the apparent motion was 93\u00b0 2' 20\".","6455":"Now let the hypothesis previously under investigation, established on the basis of the most recent observations, be brought in, and let the question be raised, at what anomalistic position do the apparent motions on the eccentric correspond to the mean motions, as I have just now given them?","6456":"After a few  trials, this is found: If for the last time the aphelion of Mars is placed at 0\u00b0 41' Leo, and for the remaining times somewhat before that, owing to the precession of the equinoxes, while at the first time the mean anomaly is 46\u00b0 37', at the second, 34\u00b0 21', and the third, 130\u00b0 37\u00bd\u2019; and thus the elongation from the equinox at the middle time was 5s 4\u00b0 59' 20\", then by the modern hypothesis of the equations the star Mars is placed at 21\u00b0 7' Gemini for the first time, 29\u00b0 [31']16 Leo for the second, and 2\u00b0 37\u00bd' Sagittarius for the third, fortuitously precise.","6457":"For the foundations are not such as to allow one to hope for such precision.","6458":"Had Ptolemy made note of more oppositions of his day, we would doubtless be experiencing greater difficulty.","6459":"For with three solar oppositions it is handled easily ^17.","6460":"Compare this aphelion with Ch.","6461":"17.","6462":"Second, the Ptolemaic equation and apogee being retained, let 30 minutes be added to the fixed stars.","6463":"The result will be slightly different.","6464":"For since Mars is half a degree beyond opposition to the sun, the corrected opposition will follow.","6465":"The sums of the diurnal motions were 1\u00b0 24', 1\u00b0 23', and 1\u00b0 20'.","6466":"Therefore, for the extra 30' the corresponding times come out almost exactly the same, to be added to all three, namely, about 8 hours 40 minutes.","6467":"To this there corresponds 8\u00bd\u2019 of Mars's apparent motion, which is to be subtracted from these 30'.","6468":"The remaining 21\u00bd\u2019 are to be added to the planet's positions, placing it at 21\u00b0 29\u00bd\u2019 Gemini, 29\u00b0 52\u00bd\u2019 Leo, and 2\u00b0 57\u00bd' Sagittarius.","6469":"The intervals both of time and of zodiacal positions will remain almost exactly the same.","6470":"Thus the distribution of the mean anomaly among these observations, which was just now found, will also be the same.","6471":"Only the aphelion will be transposed by the same number of minutes, so that on the last date it is at 1\u00b0 2\u00bd\u2019 Leo.","6472":"It therefore has to be moved 8\u00bd\u2019 back among the fixed stars.","6473":"And the mean motion from the equinox will be increased by the above mentioned 21\u00bd\u2019, but it will be 8 hours 40 minutes longer.","6474":"And to these hours there correspond 11' 24\" of mean motion.","6475":"Therefore, at the proposed time, the mean motion from the equinox will be only 10' greater than before.","6476":"But the positions of the fixed stars are 30' farther removed from the equinox.","6477":"Therefore, Mars's mean motion with respect to the fixed stars has proceeded 20' less than before.","6478":"Third, the sun's apogee being transposed by 11 or 12 degrees,18 while the longitude and equation of the fixed stars remains the same.","6479":"Then on the first date the sun will be 20' back in position;19 on the middle date practically nothing will be changed; and on the last date it will be 21\u2019 farther along in position, owing to the altered equations of the sun.","6480":"Therefore, the first opposition will be 4 hours later,20 and Mars will be the same number of minutes farther back in position, while the last opposition will occur 4\u2153 hours earlier,21 with Mars the same number of minutes farther along in position.","6481":"22 23","6482":"The first interval of time becomes smaller.","6483":"So also the corresponding mean  motion is 5' 15\" smaller, so as to be 80\u00b0 53'.","6484":"The second interval of time again becomes smaller.","6485":"Therefore, the mean motion corresponding to it is 5' 40\" smaller, namely, 96\u00b0 10' 48\".","6486":"So, since to the two mean motions, both smaller, there corresponds a greater apparent motion than before, and on the supposition that the mean anomaly is the same as before for both, the apparent motion is greater by about 9', it therefore appears that Mars has to move down from aphelion.","6487":"However, the first interval is unchanged unless a great descent is made, while the second [is corrected] by a descent of about 36\u2019 ^24.","6488":"Therefore, if we were to indulge in our enquiry, and not take the modern hypothesis as given, we would arrive at a completely different hypothesis with a new eccentricity ^25.","6489":"And if, on the other hand, these three observations of Ptolemy were perfectly certain, this would constitute the basis for an argument that he established the sun's apogee correctly.","6490":"But when 36' are subtracted from Mars's aphelion, placing it at 0\u00b0 3' Leo26 for the last time, and when its mean motion is so adjusted that for the middle time the [mean] anomaly is 34\u00b0 58\u00bd\u2019 with longitude from the equinoctial of 5s 5\u00b0 0' 50\", the following observations result:27","6491":"Again, an accurate enough approach.","6492":"For we cannot hope that the observations were of such certainty.","6493":"So, whether the sun's apogee is known correctly or not, the distance of the mean motion from the equinoctial is certain within 1\u00bd\u2019.","6494":"Fourth, the same things will be changed in the computed positions of the second case, and in establishing the mean longitude, that is, by transposing the apogee and the fixed stars ^28.","6495":"Fifth, the sun's apogee and the Ptolemaic longitude of the fixed stars remaining the same, the modern solar eccentricity is used.","6496":"Thus, while the first and last positions of the sun remain almost exactly the same, the sun's apparent position will be changed in the middle observation by 20'.","6497":"For the former fall near the sun's apsides, where the equation is small, while the latter is near the middle longitude, where the equation caused by the eccentricity is maximum.","6498":"And since in Aquarius the equation is additive, when 20' are taken away from the equation, the sun will be moved back through the same number of minutes, and will be, not in 29\u00b0 31' Aquarius, but in 29\u00b0 11' Aquarius.","6499":"The correct and truest opposition therefore follows by 4 hours ^29.","6500":"The planet will then be at 29\u00b0 27' Leo ^30.","6501":"The earlier time interval and its mean motion is increased, and the apparent motion is decreased, while the later time interval is decreased, and the apparent motion is increased.","6502":"So once again, more evidently than before, the application of this correction calls upon us to change the hypothesis, unless we had sworn allegiance to the words and numbers of the hypothesis of this era by our best judgement.","6503":"For to move the planet forward a smaller distance in a greater time near apogee, and a greater distance in a smaller time near perigee, nothing can suffice but to increase the  eccentricity.","6504":"If everything were kept the same, as in the first case, the results for the first and third times would indeed again be the same as then, namely 21\u00b0 7' Gemini and 2\u00b0 37\u00bd' Sagittarius.","6505":"But in the middle position, it would come out to be 29\u00b0 36\u00bd\u2019 Leo, where it ought to have been 29\u00b0 27' Leo, a difference of 9\u00bd' ^31.","6506":"To eliminate this, the aphelion ought to remain in about the same place, but the mean motion should omit 3\u00bd\u2019.","6507":"Then the results will be:32","6508":"Sixth, the same change of the second case will occur, if we at once change both the sun's eccentricity and the longitude of the fixed stars.","6509":"Seventh, if on the other hand we at once change both the eccentricity and apogee of the sun, combining the third and fifth cases, the fundamentals will be these ^33.","6510":"34","6511":"The first interval remains the same as in the first case, while the last is much altered.","6512":"And because more of the path is traversed in a smaller time, it must descend farther down towards perigee.","6513":"To 8 hours of mean motion correspond 10' 30\", to which add the extra 8 minutes of travel ^35.","6514":"The total is thus 18\u00bd , which we shall make up if we move the aphelion back by 1\u00b0 12', putting it at 29\u00b0 29' Cancer for the last time, with a mean anomaly of 131\u00b0 45' ^36.","6515":"Therefore, [the position of] its mean motion is 11\u00b0 4\u2019 Sagittarius,37 which, in the first case, was 11\u00b0 18\u00bd\u2019 Sagittarius.","6516":"From this we compute:38","6517":"Finally, with alterations in all three data that we have taken from Ptolemy, the result will be the combined effect of the seventh and second cases.","6518":"It is therefore apparent that the epoch of the mean motion with respect to the equinox and the fixed stars is not much changed by an alteration in the sun's eccentricity, or in the apogee, or in both at once, but that it is only changed when the positions of the fixed stars are altered.","6519":"For the third case adds 1' 30\", the fifth subtracts 3' 30\", and the seventh subtracts 4\u2019 30\".","6520":"The second case alone subtracts 10\u201939 from the mean motion measured from the equinoctial, and 20' measured from the fixed stars ^40.","6521":"As a result of this, two epochs of motion at the time of Ptolemy are  established.","6522":"But what if we make something suitable by combining the second and  fifth cases, by which we can hold simply to the Ptolemaic longitude of the fixed stars, eliminating any need for us to suspect that there might be two epochs of Mars's mean motion?","6523":"For Ptolemy explicitly affirms that in his observation he found the moon's distance from the sun to be 92\u00b0 8\u2019, the same amount he computed from his hypothesis of the moon's motions.","6524":"Ptolemy would have spoken truly: he would have been skillful enough in observing, and would have plainly seen this distance on his instrument to be the same as that prescribed by his hypothesis of the moon's motions, which was not in error near the quadratures.","6525":"From this, I argue thus.","6526":"If the sun had been at 3\u00b0 5' Pisces,41 where Ptolemy placed it using his eccentricity, the moon could not have appeared 92\u00b0 8' from it, the measure that is just and computed from the hypothesis, for the reason that the setting sun reaches the eye by refraction, and appears higher than it actually is (and thus 30\u2019 farther to the east).","6527":"But because the arc from the moon to the sun was observed to be 92\u00b0 8\u2019, and because of refraction, this was in actual fact 92\u00b0 38\u2019, the sun was therefore not at 3\u00b0 3' Pisces, but at 2\u00b0 33' Pisces.","6528":"And this is in agreement with the fifth case, where we said that Ptolemy's maximum additive equation (which occurs at 5\u00b0 Pisces) becomes 20' smaller when today's eccentricity is used, thus putting the sun at 2\u00b0 43' Pisces instead of 3\u00b0 3' Pisces.","6529":"And so, on the supposition that refraction is universal throughout all places and times, as is discussed in the Optics,42 and supposing this observation to stand, we arrive at the conclusion that the sun's eccentricity is less than that reckoned by Ptolemy.","6530":"It should not trouble you that I spoke of a refraction of 30', while this diminution is but 20'.","6531":"For if you consider well, since 30\u00b0 Taurus had culminated, 1\u00b0 Pisces was then setting at Alexandria, and the sun, being at 3\u00b0 Pisces, consequently had an altitude of two degrees, or perhaps even more, and therefore the refraction was less than 30'; nor was all the refraction simply longitudinal.","6532":"Thus these two causes43 were almost exactly the same in quantity, and cancelled one another.","6533":"However, anyone who knows anything of the Ptolemaic reckoning of the fixed stars will not consider this difference of ten minutes worth mentioning.","6534":"For example, Ptolemy comes up with an interval of 54\u00b0 10' between Cor Leonis and Spica Virginis, although in the heavens themselves it is not more than 53\u00b0 59'.","6535":"Let us therefore follow whither our inclinations and our arguments lead: as in the first case, in the second year of Antonine, on the 12th day of Epiphi, at the 8th hour, at Alexandria in Egypt, let Mars's mean motion from the  equinoctial be 11\u00b0 18' 30\" Sagittarius.","6536":"This time corresponds to the common year of Christ 139 May 27.","6537":"The difference of meridians between Hven and Alexandria is nearly two hours, from the most recent geographical tables.","6538":"Therefore, at Hven in the year of Christ 139 May 27 at 6h the mean motion was 8s 11\u00b0 18' 30\".","6539":"But in that year, Cor Leonis had a longitude of 2\u00b0 30' Leo, that is, 4s 2\u00b0 30' 0\".","6540":"Therefore Mars's mean motion was 4s 8\u00b0 48' 30\" from Cor Leonis.","6541":"But on  159944 May 27 at 6h Mars's mean motion was 0s 0\u00b0 47' 30\" from the equinoctial, while the distance of Cor Leonis from that point, as demonstrated by Brahe, was 4s 24\u00b0 15' 45\".","6542":"Therefore Mars was 7s 6\u00b0 31' 45\" from Cor Leonis.","6543":"For each year nearly one second must be subtracted.","6544":"Therefore, at noon on 1 January in the first year of Christ, at Hven, it is elongated in its mean motion by 5s 8\u00b0 52' 45\" from Cor Leonis ^45.","6545":"And so much for Mars's mean motion with respect to the fixed stars.","6546":"The motion of the aphelion will come out a little different from what it was above in Ch.","6547":"17.","6548":"For in the year of Christ 139 May 27 it was at 0\u00b0 41' Leo, while Cor Leonis was at 2\u00b0 30' Leo.","6549":"It therefore preceded the latter by 1\u00b0 49'.","6550":"But today, in 1599 May 27, it is at 28\u00b0 58' 50\" Leo, while Cor Leonis is at 24\u00b0 15' 45\" Leo.","6551":"over an interval of 1460 Julian years, which makes an annual motion of a little greater than 16\".","6552":"Therefore, the root of the Christian era, at noon on January 1, has this aphelion 2\u00b0 27' before Cor Leonis.","6553":"On the mean motion of the sun with respect to the fixed stars, treated in passing, for future reference.","6554":"In the year of Christ 139 Pharmouthi 9, which is February 23, at sunset at 5h 30m, 3h 30m at Hven, the apparent position of the sun was computed as 3\u00b0 3' Pisces; therefore, the mean position was 0\u00b0 43' Pisces.","6555":"But the longitude of Cor Leonis was found to be 2\u00b0 30' Leo.","6556":"Therefore, the mean motion of the sun preceded Cor Leonis by 5s 1\u00b0 47' 0\".","6557":"But on 1599 February 23 at 3h 30m at Hven the mean motion of the sun was at 12\u00b0 47' 41\" Pisces, and Cor Leonis 24\u00b0 15\u2019 30\" Leo.","6558":"So the mean motion of the sun preceded Cor Leonis by 5s 11\u00b0 27' 49\".","6559":"Over 1460 Egyptian years,46 9\u00b0 40' 49\" are removed ^47.","6560":"Our conclusion is 2' 42\" less than that from the Prutenics over the same","6561":"number of years, and the epoch will be 5s 7\u00b0 14\u2019 36\" from Cor Leonis at the root of the Christian era on January 1 ^48.","6562":"Similarly, the progression of the sun's apogee is found to be 8\u00b0 23\u2019, and at the root of the Christian era it was 1s 27\u00b0 48\u2019 0\" before Cor Leonis ^49.","6563":"Chapter 70","6564":"Consideration of the remaining two Ptolemaic observations, in order to investigate the latitude and ratio of the orbs at the time of Ptolemy","6565":"It is true, as I have more than once remarked, that Ptolemy had at his disposal many more observations than were presented in his Opus.","6566":"This may be seen in the presentation of the method for investigating the ratio of the orbs, where he uses a single observation that is within three days of the opposition.","6567":"For it was said in Chapter 53 that observations that are so close result in a very large error if they are off by even one minute.","6568":"Nevertheless, let us follow his footprints, and upon the hypothesis just established, erected upon the foundation of the first case, let us compute this fourth position1 as well.","6569":"2","6570":"The sun's true position on the 12th was 2\u00b0 36' Gemini ^3.","6571":"Add the motion of the three days and one hour, near apogee, which is 2\u00b0 53' 40\" from modern experience.","6572":"This makes it 5\u00b0 29' 40\" Gemini, and let the present distance of the apogee be used, 101,800.","6573":"Therefore, the point opposite the sun and Mars's eccentric position differ by 1\u00b0 5' 6\".","6574":"This arc appears to be 3\u00b0 43' 14\", so that Mars would appear at 1\u00b0 46' 26\" Sagittarius.","6575":"If, however, we use the Ptolemaic eccentricity of the sun, the sun's motion over the three days will be 1' smaller, and the sun will be at 5\u00b0 28' 40\" Gemini.","6576":"The difference is thus 1\u00b0 4' 6\".","6577":"The apparent magnitude of this arc, using the Ptolemaic distance of the sun and earth, 102,100, will be 3\u00b0 45' 45\",4 so the planet will fall at 1\u00b0 43' Sagittarius.","6578":"But Ptolemy said that it was seen at 1\u00b0 36' Sagittarius.","6579":"We have therefore come out 7' to 10' beyond the correct figure.","6580":"But the least division of the Ptolemaic instrument, which can always be considered as the uncertainty, has the value 10'.","6581":"You should also note that if we have erred by two minutes in the eccentric position, we shall now err by seven minutes in the observed position.","6582":"For let Mars be moved back to 4\u00b0 22' Sagittarius on the eccentric: it will now appear at 1\u00b0 36' Sagittarius.","6583":"Above, on Epiphi 12, there was also an excess of 1\u00bd'.","6584":"So these results are in agreement.","6585":"And because at such proximity to opposition a difference in the eccentricity  has little effect, let us also consult the more ancient observation ^5.","6586":"Between the morning of January 18 during the year 272 before Christ,6 and noon on January 1 of the year 1 of Christ, there are 272 Egyptian years, 51 days, and several hours.","6587":"For since at Alexandria, the sun at 25\u00b0 Capricorn rises at 7h, and the morning observation of Mars was made one hour earlier, as dawn was breaking, it was therefore made at the sixth hour, which is the fourth hour at Hven, from which time there are eight hours until noon.","6588":"From this time interval, by the principles laid down above, the sun's mean motion is found to have gone 5s 25\u00b0 32' 50\" beyond Cor Leonis,7 with an anomaly of 234\u00b0 54' 34\" .","6589":"The corresponding equation from Ptolemy is 2\u00b0 0' 30\", and from Brahe, 1\u00b0 42' 54\", additive; and for the former, the sun's distance from the earth is 98,790, and for the latter, 98,976.","6590":"But Mars's mean motion was then 2s 6\u00b0 7' 12\" beyond Cor Leonis.","6591":"Also, since the aphelion is 3\u00b0 40' 20\" before Cor, Mars's anomaly will be 69\u00b0 47' 32\", the equated anomaly 60\u00b0 15' 27\", and the distance 158,320.","6592":"Here we shall follow a twofold path to the end of the calculation.","6593":"The first is through the Ptolemaic eccentricity and equation.","6594":"Then the sun's elongation from Cor Leonis is 5s 27\u00b0 33' 20\",8 differing from Mars's eccentric longitude of 1s 26\u00b0 35' 7\" by 4s 0\u00b0 58' 13\".","6595":"This arc length, and the distances of the earth and Mars from the sun, show an apparent elongation from the sun of 82\u00b0 43' 46\".","6596":"Thus the apparent elongation of Mars from Cor Leonis is 3s 4\u00b0 49' 34\" ^9.","6597":"And the second path is through the Brahean eccentricity and equations, if they are assumed to have been the same then as well.","6598":"The sun's apparent position will be 17' 36\" farther back, or 5s 27\u00b0 15' 44\" ^10.","6599":"Thus the angle of commutation is 4s 0\u00b0 40' 37\".","6600":"Through this, together with our value for the sun's distance from earth, as if it too were the same then, Mars's apparent elongation from Cor Leonis is shown as 3s 4\u00b0 51' 28\" ^11.","6601":"The difference between the two calculations is very small and of no significance.","6602":"Is it then true that","6603":"Mars was observed as if placed upon or fitted to the northern star in the brow of Scorpius,12","6604":"as the description of the observation proclaims?","6605":"Let us see.","6606":"For Ptolemy, Cor Leonis is at 2\u00b0 30' Leo, and the Northern Bright Star in the Brow of Scorpius is at 6\u00b0 20' Scorpio, at an elongation of 3s 3\u00b0 50' 0\".","6607":"For Brahe, Cor Leonis is at 24\u00b0 17' Leo.","6608":"The brow of Scorpius is at 27\u00b0 36' Scorpio.","6609":"The elongation is 3s 3\u00b0 20' 0\" ^13.","6610":"But Mars's elongation was just computed to be 3s 4\u00b0 51' 28\".","6611":"The difference is a degree and a half.","6612":"Since he had confidence in this observation, it being the most ancient of those upon which he could have depended, Ptolemy doubtless established that ratio of the orbs which we have hitherto discovered in his numbers, and which this observation appeared to require.","6613":"For in the mean motion computed for this time, he differs from me by no more than 20 minutes.","6614":"The remaining discrepancy therefore comes from the ratio of the orbs.","6615":"Now because he pretends to investigate this ratio using an observation three days from opposition, he made different things seem to be deduced from different phenomena.","6616":"And so since the ancient observation was to be reserved for investigating the mean motions, he substituted the other one for finding the ratio of the orbs, which had already been found using the ancient one.","6617":"As was just said, it is absurd to test the ratio of the orbs using an observation as close to opposition as the one by which Ptolemy pretends to have demonstrated this ratio.","6618":"Let no one therefore wonder at our differing by a degree and a half from the observation that Ptolemy summoned from antiquity: let him rather examine Ptolemy's ratio of the orbs, so different from those proven by present day observations, and consider that in order to keep this observation, Ptolemy corrupted the ratio of his orbs.","6619":"As for the observation itself, of which this is the verbal description: \u1f11\u1ff3\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f41 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u1f08\u03c1\u03ad\u03c9\u03c2 \u1f10\u03b4\u03cc\u03ba\u03b5\u03b9 \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03b8\u03b5\u03b9\u03ba\u03ad\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u1ff7

just come upon the northern brow of Scorpius),14 I believe that an error was committed by Ptolemy, who understood the first star of Scorpius, while the observer nodded towards the fifth ^15.","6620":"This is proven from the words themselves.","6621":"For the brow of Scorpius has six bright stars.","6622":"Of these, there are three prominent ones, of third magnitude, or better, second.","6623":"The remaining three are of fourth, or, by my estimate, third magnitude, and one is higher than the three bright ones, and farther north.","6624":"Now if the observer called the \"Bright Star in the Brow\" (which Brahe correctly pronounces to be of second magnitude, and which Ptolemy understood to be the intended star) the \"Northern Brow\", did he not speak ambiguously in saying simply \"northern\" rather than \"brightest of the northern\", since the star was not the northernmost?","6625":"Thus I, much more prudently, will take it to be the northernmost, the fifth in number, that was described by the observer.","6626":"Furthermore, my computed longitude of Mars agrees with this, and not with the Bright Star of the Brow; and this while the hypothesis remains valid which the modern Brahean observations have generated.","6627":"For Brahe places the northernmost star at 29\u00b0 3\u00bd\u2019 Scorpio.","6628":"Subtract Cor Leonis at 24\u00b0 17' Leo.","6629":"The difference will be its elongation from Cor, 94\u00b0 46\u00bd\u2019.","6630":"But our calculation puts Mars at an elongation of 94\u00b0 49\u00bd' or 94\u00b0 51\u00bd' from Cor Leonis ^16.","6631":"The difference is 3 or 5 minutes, not greater.","6632":"I do not deny that the latitude presents a difficulty for me, in that I  interpret the words, \u1f10\u03b4\u03cc\u03ba\u03b5\u03b9

appeared to touch one another.\"","6633":"The Arabic, however, translates it [with a word signifying] \"to have covered up,\" as if the Greek had read,

^17.","6636":"The best word in German is \"drangesetzt.\"","6637":"From this I reasoned as follows.","6638":"Whether Mars ran beneath it centrally, or grazed its northern or southern margin, it could not have been removed from the star latitudinally by any great distance.","6639":"For indeed, the latitudes are less uncertain than the longitudes, since the manner of their variation is simpler and more consistent, as is proven in this book.","6640":"We now know that the node retrogresses with respect to the fixed stars, by 4\u00b0 15' during one \"year of the Dog,\"18 as was proven in Ch.","6641":"17.","6642":"For Ptolemy, the northern limit was considered to precede Cor Leonis by 3\u00bd degrees.","6643":"For us, over the intervening 410 years, it had retrogressed one degree, so that at the time of observation it would be 2\u00bd\u00b0 before Cor Leonis.","6644":"Therefore, the node is 87\u00bd\u00b0 past Cor Leonis.","6645":"But Mars is 56\u00b0 35' past Cor Leonis.","6646":"Therefore, it is 31\u00b0 from the node, making the inclination 57\u00bd\u2019, which, by the parallax of the orb, results in a true latitude of 1\u00b0 7' ^19.","6647":"But now it is clear from Brahe that the  latitude of the Bright Star of the Brow is 1\u00b0 5', while that of the Northernmost Star of the Brow is 1\u00b0 42'.","6648":"So the latitude appeared to refute me concerning the Bright Star of the Brow, leading me to believe that this star was occulted by Mars, and not the other.","6649":"But this collusion of numbers is fortuitous.","6650":"For in the latitude of the Northernmost Star of the Brow Brahe and Ptolemy are in agreement, the former pronouncing it to be 1\u00b0 46', and the latter, 1\u00b0 42'.","6651":"In the latitude of the Bright one they differ.","6652":"Ptolemy has 1\u00b0 20'; Brahe, 1\u00b0 5'.","6653":"But the former numerical equality results from an error, and the latter difference is really more like an agreement.","6654":"For the latitudes of the northern stars in Scorpius, Sagittarius, Capricorn, and Aquarius are smaller today than they once were by about 16' 20\", and those of the southern stars are greater by the same amount, since the ecliptic has been transposed and the declinations of the degrees of the ecliptic have been altered by the same amount, as Brahe proved and as we have said in Ch.","6655":"68.","6656":"Thus if it is true\u2014and it is very true\u2014that the latitude of the Bright Star in the Brow of Scorpius is 1\u00b0 5' today, at the time of Ptolemy and Hipparchus it was no less than 1\u00b0 20', probably greater.","6657":"And so Mars has a smaller northern latitude than either of the stars mentioned, and passed beneath both.","6658":"For it is certain that even if we are too high by a whole degree in [the position of] the node, the latitude in the calculation was wrong by no more than three minutes.","6659":"Also, it has now been shown in Ch.","6660":"64 to be entirely uncertain whether the northern latitude for Mars was also once greater in the southern signs.","6661":"Therefore, my clever interpretation of the word \u201c\u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03b8\u03b5\u03b9\u03ba\u03ad\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 was in vain.","6662":"It can only be explained as denoting the stars' being placed side by side in the same longitude; and on this ground, the one that I favor is just as good a candidate as the Bright, its greater latitude notwithstanding.","6663":"Consider whether the meaning could be this: that since in the northern part of the brow there are three stars in the form of a triangle, Mars was sighted in the middle of them, and was thus \"placed upon the northern brow\" of Scorpius, it having simply been made one of that number of stars that are in the northern part of the brow of Scorpius.","6664":"This interpretation is furthered by the observer's having said \"northern brow\" rather than \"northern star of the brow\", since he is denoting, not one single star, but an entire part of the constellation.","6665":"So these two ancient observations are of no use to us in estimating either the latitude or the ratio of the orbs at that time.","6666":"Therefore, since there are no observations to the contrary to impede us, while the extreme likelihood of our position confirms us in it, let us conclude that the ratio of the orbs is also the same today as it was once, while the maximum latitudes today are somewhat altered."},"Entities":{"5865":[],"5866":[["nodes","ASTR"]],"5867":[["Mars","PLAN"],["eccentricity","ASTR"]],"5868":[],"5869":[["nodes","ASTR"]],"5870":[["1593 December 10","DATE"],["7h
