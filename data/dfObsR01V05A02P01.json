First, it was apparent that the three superior planets, Saturn, Jupiter, and Mars, attune their motions to their proximity to the sun. For if the sun would approach them they moved forward and were swifter than usual; where the sun would come to the signs opposite the planets they retraced with crablike steps the road they had just covered; between these two times they became stationary; and these things always used to occur, no matter what the signs of the zodiac in which the planets might have been seen. At the same time, it was clear to the eye that the planets appeared large when retrograde, and small when anticipating the coming of the sun with a direct and swift motion. From this, the conclusion was easily reached that when the sun approaches they are raised up and recede from the lands, and when the sun departs towards the opposite signs they descend again towards the lands ^5. And finally, it was observed that these phenomena of retrogressions and increase of luminosity, just described, was moved through the signs of the zodiac in the order that tended from west through the meridian eastward, so that whatever has happened at one time in Pisces soon would come to pass similarly in Aries, then in Taurus, and so on in consequence.","34":"Now that the first and diurnal motion had thus been set aside, and only those motions that are apprehended by comparison over a period of days, and that belong to the planets individually, were considered, there appeared in these motions a much more complicated mingling than before, when the diurnal and common motion was still mixed in with them.

The hypothesis attributes another motive power to the planet itself, which has the capacity to adjust its approach to and recession from the sun, either by the strength of the angles or by inspection of the increase or decrease of the solar diameter, and to make the difference between the mean distance and the longest and shortest equal to AB.

The hypothesis attributes another motive power to the planet itself, which has the capacity to adjust its approach to and recession from the sun, either by the strength of the angles or by inspection of the increase or decrease of the solar diameter, and to make the difference between the mean distance and the longest and shortest equal to AB.

It therefore needs both a comprehension of the circle and a desire to effect it. Also, the ratios of its own slowness and swiftness must differ from the gradations of the external power.

This happened to Tycho in his lunar theory, inasmuch as he followed Copernicus.","232":"Besides, should Copernicus retain that liberty he had of setting up the ratios of the epicycles, it can happen that the planet's path would come out twisted, higher before and after apogee than at apogee itself, and lower before and after perigee than at perigee itself.

This  changes what cannot be changed in the planet\u2019s path, because, unlike the optical slowing, the physical slowing is independent of the observer\u2019s viewpoint. Even though the planet would traverse the same path \u03b9\u03b7 in twenty days (which path appears greater at \u03b1 and smaller at \u03b4), nevertheless, if you consider the parts of this time, their ratio in comparison with the parts of this path will be violently perturbed, and much more so at other places, not between \u03b9 and \u03b7. In particular, for the observer at \u03b1 the quantity of his equations will be changed noticeably if, for the observer at \u03b4, you will prevent the planet\u2019s being slowest at \u03b9; that is, if you transfer the equant from \u03b3 to \u03bc. For if you draw a straight line through \u03b3\u03bc to the point \u03bd on the circumference and connect \u03b1\u03bd, this equation \u03b1\u03bd\u03bc alone will be equal to the prior, \u03b1\u03bd\u03b3. Above \u03bd the equations about \u03bc will be smaller, and below \u03bd, greater. For example, at \u03b7 the angle \u03bc\u03bd\u03b1 is much less than \u03b3\u03b7\u03b1.

Whence it follows that for the observer at \u03b1, his equation will be more in error, even when it is at a maximum, on account of the increased eccentricity. Not only will the planet be slowest in a different place than before, but in also by a different and in fact greater measure of its true slowness. It is clear, therefore, that the equivalence we have been seeking cannot be established by drawing the line of apsides from \u03b4 through the center of the eccentric \u03b2.

Even though the planet would traverse the same path \u03b9\u03b7 in twenty days (which path appears greater at \u03b1 and smaller at \u03b4), nevertheless, if you consider the parts of this time, their ratio in comparison with the parts of this path will be violently perturbed, and much more so at other places, not between \u03b9 and \u03b7. In particular, for the observer at \u03b1 the quantity of his equations will be changed noticeably if, for the observer at \u03b4, you will prevent the planet\u2019s being slowest at \u03b9; that is, if you transfer the equant from \u03b3 to \u03bc. For if you draw a straight line through \u03b3\u03bc to the point \u03bd on the circumference and connect \u03b1\u03bd, this equation \u03b1\u03bd\u03bc alone will be equal to the prior, \u03b1\u03bd\u03b3. Above \u03bd the equations about \u03bc will be smaller, and below \u03bd, greater. For example, at \u03b7 the angle \u03bc\u03bd\u03b1 is much less than \u03b3\u03b7\u03b1. But then what we proposed to do has not been done, for the prior form of hypothesis has not yet been quite established. For \u03b1\u03b2 is not to \u03b2\u03b3 as \u03b4\u03b2 is to \u03b2\u03bc, since \u03b2\u03bc is equal to \u03b2\u03b3, while \u03b4\u03b2 is greater than \u03b1\u03b2. But if, on the other hand, you make \u03b4\u03b2 be to \u03b2\u03bc as \u03b1\u03b2 is to \u03b2\u03b3, \u03b2\u03bc will become greater than \u03b2\u03b3. Whence it follows that for the observer at \u03b1, his equation will be more in error, even when it is at a maximum, on account of the increased eccentricity. Not only will the planet be slowest in a different place than before, but in also by a different and in fact greater measure of its true slowness. It is clear, therefore, that the equivalence we have been seeking cannot be established by drawing the line of apsides from \u03b4 through the center of the eccentric \u03b2. And since it has at the same time become clear how important it is to keep the same equant point \u03b3, a breakthrough must in all events be made here, or nowhere.","360":"It is thus established that when a planet's path in the heavens remains in all respects unchanged, the form of hypothesis cannot persist entirely unchanged. This raises the further question, how much the path of a planet is changed from its prior position if the same form of hypothesis is set up about \u03b4, and how much this newly established hypothesis at \u03b4 will be at variance with the appearances as seen at \u03b1.

Since \u03b3 is the common center upon whose circle the times are indicated, let the line \u03b3\u03b5\u03b9 indicate the same moment in both hypotheses. Therefore, if the planet is traversing the eccentric \u03b5\u03bf, it will at that moment be at \u03b5 with equation \u03b4\u03b5\u03b3, but if it is traversing \u03b9\u03be, it will be at \u03b9 with no equation, since the line of apparent motion \u03b1\u03b9 coincides with the line of mean motion \u03b3\u03b9.

Thus, in both instances, the planet is always on a line drawn from \u03b3, at the point where that line cuts one or another eccentric. If the observer were at \u03b3, there would be no difference in the appearances, whether the planet were at k or at \u03b6.

In order that this difference become perceptible, three factors must concur. First, the distance itself must be large (just as it is a maximum around \u03bf\u03be and \u03c1\u03c0). Second, as nearly as possible it should be presented directly to an observer at \u03b4 (just as it vanishes at \u03b6\u03ba and the point opposite) according to optical principles. Thus, it appears greatest at the intermediate regions, below \u03be and above \u03c1. Third, it must be close to \u03b4 (just as it is closer above \u03c1 than below \u03be, because the center of the other eccentric \u03b2 lies off to the right of \u03b4). If we construct a right angle to point \u03b3 of the line \u03b3\u03b4, this perpendicular from \u03b3 to the circumference will bring us as close as possible to the place where the apparent magnitude is greatest. Let \u03c3\u03c6 be drawn through \u03b3 perpendicular to \u03b4\u03b3, intersecting the eccentric about \u03b8 at \u03c3 and \u03c5, and the other at \u03c4 and \u03c6, and to this let the perpendicular \u03b2\u03c7 be dropped.

The magnitude \u03b8\u03b3 is 7411, and  \u03b8\u03b3\u03c5 is right. Therefore, \u03b3\u03c5 is 99,725. The same is to be done in \u03b2\u03b3\u03c6. But first, \u03b2\u03c75 has to be found.

At that time, the planet traversing the eccentric \u03b5o will be at k with no equation, while the planet traversing \u03b9\u03be will be at \u03b6 with equation \u03b3\u03b6\u03b1. Thus, in both instances, the planet is always on a line drawn from \u03b3, at the point where that line cuts one or another eccentric. If the observer were at \u03b3, there would be no difference in the appearances, whether the planet were at k or at \u03b6. But since in the present model the observer is placed at \u03b4 by the practitioners4 and at \u03b1 by myself, the question arises at what point on the circumference the distance between the eccentrics is perceptibly a maximum for the observer at \u03b4. In order that this difference become perceptible, three factors must concur. First, the distance itself must be large (just as it is a maximum around \u03bf\u03be and \u03c1\u03c0). Second, as nearly as possible it should be presented directly to an observer at \u03b4 (just as it vanishes at \u03b6\u03ba and the point opposite) according to optical principles. Thus, it appears greatest at the intermediate regions, below \u03be and above \u03c1. Third, it must be close to \u03b4 (just as it is closer above \u03c1 than below \u03be, because the center of the other eccentric \u03b2 lies off to the right of \u03b4). If we construct a right angle to point \u03b3 of the line \u03b3\u03b4, this perpendicular from \u03b3 to the circumference will bring us as close as possible to the place where the apparent magnitude is greatest. Let \u03c3\u03c6 be drawn through \u03b3 perpendicular to \u03b4\u03b3, intersecting the eccentric about \u03b8 at \u03c3 and \u03c5, and the other at \u03c4 and \u03c6, and to this let the perpendicular \u03b2\u03c7 be dropped. Therefore, at the moment \u03b3\u03c3 the planet will be at \u03c3 and \u03c4, and at the moment \u03b3\u03c6, at \u03c5 and \u03c6. First of all, the quantity \u03c5\u03c6 must be found. Let \u03b8\u03c5 and \u03b2\u03c6 be joined. In \u03b8\u03c5\u03b3, \u03b8\u03c5 is given as 100,000, because \u03b8 is the center of the eccentric \u03c5. The magnitude \u03b8\u03b3 is 7411, and  \u03b8\u03b3\u03c5 is right. Therefore, \u03b3\u03c5 is 99,725. The same is to be done in \u03b2\u03b3\u03c6. But first, \u03b2\u03c75 has to be found. This will be revealed by the triangle \u03b2\u03b3\u03c7, in which \u03b2\u03c7 is parallel to \u03b8\u03b3, the angle at \u03c7 is right, and \u03b3\u03b2\u03c7 is equal to \u03b8\u03b3\u03b2 (5\u00b0 27\u2019 47\u201d) and \u03b2\u03b3 is 6763. Hence, the sides are found to be: \u03b3\u03c7 644, \u03b2\u03c7 6732. Therefore, in the right triangle \u03b2\u03c7\u03c6, since \u03b2\u03c6 is 100,000 (\u03b2 being the center of the eccentric \u03c6) and \u03c7\u03b2 is 6732, \u03c7\u03c6 will be 99,773. Add \u03c7\u03b3, 644, and \u03b3\u03c6 is given, 100,417. But \u03b3\u03c5 was 99,725. Therefore, the quantity sought, \u03c5\u03c6, is 692.","383":"To find the basis of a computation whereby we may investigate, for the observer at \u03b4, how much his appearances are changed by transposing the eccentric from \u03c1\u03b8\u03bf to \u03c0\u03b2\u03be, we must proceed as follows. Since \u03b3 is the common center upon whose circle the times are indicated, let the line \u03b3\u03b5\u03b9 indicate the same moment in both hypotheses.

Since \u03b3 is the common center upon whose circle the times are indicated, let the line \u03b3\u03b5\u03b9 indicate the same moment in both hypotheses. Therefore, if the planet is traversing the eccentric \u03b5\u03bf, it will at that moment be at \u03b5 with equation \u03b4\u03b5\u03b3, but if it is traversing \u03b9\u03be, it will be at \u03b9 with no equation, since the line of apparent motion \u03b1\u03b9 coincides with the line of mean motion \u03b3\u03b9.

Thus, in both instances, the planet is always on a line drawn from \u03b3, at the point where that line cuts one or another eccentric. If the observer were at \u03b3, there would be no difference in the appearances, whether the planet were at k or at \u03b6.

Third, it must be close to \u03b4 (just as it is closer above \u03c1 than below \u03be, because the center of the other eccentric \u03b2 lies off to the right of \u03b4). If we construct a right angle to point \u03b3 of the line \u03b3\u03b4, this perpendicular from \u03b3 to the circumference will bring us as close as possible to the place where the apparent magnitude is greatest.

The magnitude \u03b8\u03b3 is 7411, and  \u03b8\u03b3\u03c5 is right. Therefore, \u03b3\u03c5 is 99,725. The same is to be done in \u03b2\u03b3\u03c6. But first, \u03b2\u03c75 has to be found.

The magnitude \u03b8\u03b3 is 7411, and  \u03b8\u03b3\u03c5 is right. Therefore, \u03b3\u03c5 is 99,725. The same is to be done in \u03b2\u03b3\u03c6. But first, \u03b2\u03c75 has to be found. This will be revealed by the triangle \u03b2\u03b3\u03c7, in which \u03b2\u03c7 is parallel to \u03b8\u03b3, the angle at \u03c7 is right, and \u03b3\u03b2\u03c7 is equal to \u03b8\u03b3\u03b2 (5\u00b0 27\u2019 47\u201d) and \u03b2\u03b3 is 6763. Hence, the sides are found to be: \u03b3\u03c7 644, \u03b2\u03c7 6732. Therefore, in the right triangle \u03b2\u03c7\u03c6, since \u03b2\u03c6 is 100,000 (\u03b2 being the center of the eccentric \u03c6) and \u03c7\u03b2 is 6732, \u03c7\u03c6 will be 99,773. Add \u03c7\u03b3, 644, and \u03b3\u03c6 is given, 100,417. But \u03b3\u03c5 was 99,725. Therefore, the quantity sought, \u03c5\u03c6, is 692.","392":"To find the basis of a computation whereby we may investigate, for the observer at \u03b4, how much his appearances are changed by transposing the eccentric from \u03c1\u03b8\u03bf to \u03c0\u03b2\u03be, we must proceed as follows. Since \u03b3 is the common center upon whose circle the times are indicated, let the line \u03b3\u03b5\u03b9 indicate the same moment in both hypotheses. Therefore, if the planet is traversing the eccentric \u03b5\u03bf, it will at that moment be at \u03b5 with equation \u03b4\u03b5\u03b3, but if it is traversing \u03b9\u03be, it will be at \u03b9 with no equation, since the line of apparent motion \u03b1\u03b9 coincides with the line of mean motion \u03b3\u03b9.

Thus, in both instances, the planet is always on a line drawn from \u03b3, at the point where that line cuts one or another eccentric. If the observer were at \u03b3, there would be no difference in the appearances, whether the planet were at k or at \u03b6. But since in the present model the observer is placed at \u03b4 by the practitioners4 and at \u03b1 by myself, the question arises at what point on the circumference the distance between the eccentrics is perceptibly a maximum for the observer at \u03b4. In order that this difference become perceptible, three factors must concur. First, the distance itself must be large (just as it is a maximum around \u03bf\u03be and \u03c1\u03c0). Second, as nearly as possible it should be presented directly to an observer at \u03b4 (just as it vanishes at \u03b6\u03ba and the point opposite) according to optical principles. Thus, it appears greatest at the intermediate regions, below \u03be and above \u03c1. Third, it must be close to \u03b4 (just as it is closer above \u03c1 than below \u03be, because the center of the other eccentric \u03b2 lies off to the right of \u03b4). If we construct a right angle to point \u03b3 of the line \u03b3\u03b4, this perpendicular from \u03b3 to the circumference will bring us as close as possible to the place where the apparent magnitude is greatest. Let \u03c3\u03c6 be drawn through \u03b3 perpendicular to \u03b4\u03b3, intersecting the eccentric about \u03b8 at \u03c3 and \u03c5, and the other at \u03c4 and \u03c6, and to this let the perpendicular \u03b2\u03c7 be dropped. Therefore, at the moment \u03b3\u03c3 the planet will be at \u03c3 and \u03c4, and at the moment \u03b3\u03c6, at \u03c5 and \u03c6. First of all, the quantity \u03c5\u03c6 must be found.

Third, it must be close to \u03b4 (just as it is closer above \u03c1 than below \u03be, because the center of the other eccentric \u03b2 lies off to the right of \u03b4). If we construct a right angle to point \u03b3 of the line \u03b3\u03b4, this perpendicular from \u03b3 to the circumference will bring us as close as possible to the place where the apparent magnitude is greatest. Let \u03c3\u03c6 be drawn through \u03b3 perpendicular to \u03b4\u03b3, intersecting the eccentric about \u03b8 at \u03c3 and \u03c5, and the other at \u03c4 and \u03c6, and to this let the perpendicular \u03b2\u03c7 be dropped. Therefore, at the moment \u03b3\u03c3 the planet will be at \u03c3 and \u03c4, and at the moment \u03b3\u03c6, at \u03c5 and \u03c6. First of all, the quantity \u03c5\u03c6 must be found. Let \u03b8\u03c5 and \u03b2\u03c6 be joined. In \u03b8\u03c5\u03b3, \u03b8\u03c5 is given as 100,000, because \u03b8 is the center of the eccentric \u03c5. The magnitude \u03b8\u03b3 is 7411, and  \u03b8\u03b3\u03c5 is right. Therefore, \u03b3\u03c5 is 99,725. The same is to be done in \u03b2\u03b3\u03c6. But first, \u03b2\u03c75 has to be found. This will be revealed by the triangle \u03b2\u03b3\u03c7, in which \u03b2\u03c7 is parallel to \u03b8\u03b3, the angle at \u03c7 is right, and \u03b3\u03b2\u03c7 is equal to \u03b8\u03b3\u03b2 (5\u00b0 27\u2019 47\u201d) and \u03b2\u03b3 is 6763. Hence, the sides are found to be: \u03b3\u03c7 644, \u03b2\u03c7 6732. Therefore, in the right triangle \u03b2\u03c7\u03c6, since \u03b2\u03c6 is 100,000 (\u03b2 being the center of the eccentric \u03c6) and \u03c7\u03b2 is 6732, \u03c7\u03c6 will be 99,773. Add \u03c7\u03b3, 644, and \u03b3\u03c6 is given, 100,417. But \u03b3\u03c5 was 99,725. Therefore, the quantity sought, \u03c5\u03c6, is 692.","397":"To find the basis of a computation whereby we may investigate, for the observer at \u03b4, how much his appearances are changed by transposing the eccentric from \u03c1\u03b8\u03bf to \u03c0\u03b2\u03be, we must proceed as follows. Since \u03b3 is the common center upon whose circle the times are indicated, let the line \u03b3\u03b5\u03b9 indicate the same moment in both hypotheses. Therefore, if the planet is traversing the eccentric \u03b5\u03bf, it will at that moment be at \u03b5 with equation \u03b4\u03b5\u03b3, but if it is traversing \u03b9\u03be, it will be at \u03b9 with no equation, since the line of apparent motion \u03b1\u03b9 coincides with the line of mean motion \u03b3\u03b9.

Thus, in both instances, the planet is always on a line drawn from \u03b3, at the point where that line cuts one or another eccentric. If the observer were at \u03b3, there would be no difference in the appearances, whether the planet were at k or at \u03b6. But since in the present model the observer is placed at \u03b4 by the practitioners4 and at \u03b1 by myself, the question arises at what point on the circumference the distance between the eccentrics is perceptibly a maximum for the observer at \u03b4.

Thus, in both instances, the planet is always on a line drawn from \u03b3, at the point where that line cuts one or another eccentric. If the observer were at \u03b3, there would be no difference in the appearances, whether the planet were at k or at \u03b6. But since in the present model the observer is placed at \u03b4 by the practitioners4 and at \u03b1 by myself, the question arises at what point on the circumference the distance between the eccentrics is perceptibly a maximum for the observer at \u03b4. In order that this difference become perceptible, three factors must concur. First, the distance itself must be large (just as it is a maximum around \u03bf\u03be and \u03c1\u03c0). Second, as nearly as possible it should be presented directly to an observer at \u03b4 (just as it vanishes at \u03b6\u03ba and the point opposite) according to optical principles. Thus, it appears greatest at the intermediate regions, below \u03be and above \u03c1. Third, it must be close to \u03b4 (just as it is closer above \u03c1 than below \u03be, because the center of the other eccentric \u03b2 lies off to the right of \u03b4). If we construct a right angle to point \u03b3 of the line \u03b3\u03b4, this perpendicular from \u03b3 to the circumference will bring us as close as possible to the place where the apparent magnitude is greatest. Let \u03c3\u03c6 be drawn through \u03b3 perpendicular to \u03b4\u03b3, intersecting the eccentric about \u03b8 at \u03c3 and \u03c5, and the other at \u03c4 and \u03c6, and to this let the perpendicular \u03b2\u03c7 be dropped. Therefore, at the moment \u03b3\u03c3 the planet will be at \u03c3 and \u03c4, and at the moment \u03b3\u03c6, at \u03c5 and \u03c6. First of all, the quantity \u03c5\u03c6 must be found. Let \u03b8\u03c5 and \u03b2\u03c6 be joined. In \u03b8\u03c5\u03b3, \u03b8\u03c5 is given as 100,000, because \u03b8 is the center of the eccentric \u03c5. The magnitude \u03b8\u03b3 is 7411, and  \u03b8\u03b3\u03c5 is right. Therefore, \u03b3\u03c5 is 99,725. The same is to be done in \u03b2\u03b3\u03c6. But first, \u03b2\u03c75 has to be found. This will be revealed by the triangle \u03b2\u03b3\u03c7, in which \u03b2\u03c7 is parallel to \u03b8\u03b3, the angle at \u03c7 is right, and \u03b3\u03b2\u03c7 is equal to \u03b8\u03b3\u03b2 (5\u00b0 27\u2019 47\u201d) and \u03b2\u03b3 is 6763. Hence, the sides are found to be: \u03b3\u03c7 644, \u03b2\u03c7 6732. Therefore, in the right triangle \u03b2\u03c7\u03c6, since \u03b2\u03c6 is 100,000 (\u03b2 being the center of the eccentric \u03c6) and \u03c7\u03b2 is 6732, \u03c7\u03c6 will be 99,773. Add \u03c7\u03b3, 644, and \u03b3\u03c6 is given, 100,417. But \u03b3\u03c5 was 99,725. Therefore, the quantity sought, \u03c5\u03c6, is 692.","402":"To find the basis of a computation whereby we may investigate, for the observer at \u03b4, how much his appearances are changed by transposing the eccentric from \u03c1\u03b8\u03bf to \u03c0\u03b2\u03be, we must proceed as follows. Since \u03b3 is the common center upon whose circle the times are indicated, let the line \u03b3\u03b5\u03b9 indicate the same moment in both hypotheses. Therefore, if the planet is traversing the eccentric \u03b5\u03bf, it will at that moment be at \u03b5 with equation \u03b4\u03b5\u03b3, but if it is traversing \u03b9\u03be, it will be at \u03b9 with no equation, since the line of apparent motion \u03b1\u03b9 coincides with the line of mean motion \u03b3\u03b9. Again, after a certain amount of time, whose measure shall be \u03b9\u03b3\u03b6 or \u03b5\u03b3\u03ba, whose vertical angle is \u03b4\u03b3\u03b1, just found to be 5\u00b0 27\u2019 47\u201d, let a common moment be taken, represented by \u03b3\u03ba\u03b6. At that time, the planet traversing the eccentric \u03b5o will be at k with no equation, while the planet traversing \u03b9\u03be will be at \u03b6 with equation \u03b3\u03b6\u03b1. Thus, in both instances, the planet is always on a line drawn from \u03b3, at the point where that line cuts one or another eccentric. If the observer were at \u03b3, there would be no difference in the appearances, whether the planet were at k or at \u03b6.

Third, it must be close to \u03b4 (just as it is closer above \u03c1 than below \u03be, because the center of the other eccentric \u03b2 lies off to the right of \u03b4). If we construct a right angle to point \u03b3 of the line \u03b3\u03b4, this perpendicular from \u03b3 to the circumference will bring us as close as possible to the place where the apparent magnitude is greatest. Let \u03c3\u03c6 be drawn through \u03b3 perpendicular to \u03b4\u03b3, intersecting the eccentric about \u03b8 at \u03c3 and \u03c5, and the other at \u03c4 and \u03c6, and to this let the perpendicular \u03b2\u03c7 be dropped. Therefore, at the moment \u03b3\u03c3 the planet will be at \u03c3 and \u03c4, and at the moment \u03b3\u03c6, at \u03c5 and \u03c6. First of all, the quantity \u03c5\u03c6 must be found. Let \u03b8\u03c5 and \u03b2\u03c6 be joined. In \u03b8\u03c5\u03b3, \u03b8\u03c5 is given as 100,000, because \u03b8 is the center of the eccentric \u03c5. The magnitude \u03b8\u03b3 is 7411, and  \u03b8\u03b3\u03c5 is right. Therefore, \u03b3\u03c5 is 99,725. The same is to be done in \u03b2\u03b3\u03c6. But first, \u03b2\u03c75 has to be found.

But because \u03bf is a right angle, \u03bd\u03c8, that is, \u03b5\u03c8, is the power of the known \u03bf\u03b5 (476\u00bd) and o\u03c8 which is composed of the known \u03bf\u03b1 and \u03b1\u03c8, which is unknown but was also noted previously. Therefore, \u03bf\u03c8 must be made long enough that when you add the powers of \u03c8\u03bf and \u03bf\u03b5, the side \u03b5\u03c8 or \u03c8\u03bd will be just so long that when the power of the sum of \u03b2\u03bd and \u03bd\u03c8 is diminished by the power of \u03b2\u03b1, it leaves the power of \u03c8\u03b1 of such a magnitude that when it is compounded with \u03b1\u03bf the sum is equal to \u03bf\u03c8 that was taken at the beginning ^16.

But above, \u03b1\u03b2 or \u03c1\u03b4 were inclined to \u03c1\u03bb or \u03b2\u03ba by 3\u00b0 0\u2019 6\u201d, which latter lies at 5\u00bd\u02da Cancer. Therefore, \u03c1\u03b9 or \u03b1\u03b2 will be at 8\u00bd\u00b0 Cancer, and \u03c8\u03b2 is consequently at 16\u00b0 Cancer. Therefore (assuming these numbers), when the sun is passing through 16\u00b0 Cancer while the planet is at 8\u00bd\u00b0 Capricorn in its mean and uniform motion, and in the neighborhood of 27\u00b0 Scorpio in its apparent motion, \u03b5\u03c1 appears maximum. If the planet is beyond 8\u00bd\u02da Capricorn, that is, beyond \u03c1\u03b5, even though \u03c1\u03b5 is then diminished, its apparent size can increase when viewed from a point beyond \u03bd owing to the greater nearness of the orbs. This apparent size is now immediately obtained. For since \u03bf\u03c8 was found to be 25,772, and \u03bf\u03c1 476\u00bd, \u03bf\u03c8\u03b5 will be 1\u00b0 3\u2019 32\u201d But \u03c1\u03bd\u03b5  (which is what we have been seeking) is equal to \u03bf\u03c8\u03b5, by Euclid III. 20. This is because the whole angle at the center \u03c1\u03c8\u03b5 is twice the angle at the circumference \u03c1\u03bd\u03b5, and at the same time \u03bf\u03c8\u03b5 is half of \u03c1\u03c8\u03b5. But if \u03b2\u03b4 and \u03ba\u03b4 be bisected [at \u03bb and \u03bc], and \u03bb\u03bc were to be taken as half \u03b2\u03ba (on which more will be said below), then \u03c1\u03b5, and consequently its angle at \u03bd as well, could possibly become greater by one fourth. So, at last, you see how much my transposition of the hypothesis from the mean to the apparent position of the sun creates a disturbance in the annual parallax.","646":"Therefore, by the observations as well, a door has opened for us to determine what I had deduced a priori by consideration of moving causes: that the planet\u2019s line of apsides, which is the only line bisecting the planet\u2019s path into two semicircles equal both in size and in vigor\u2014this line, I say, does not (as the practitioners have it) pass through some point other than the sun, but right through the center of the solar body.

For whenever the planet fell upon these lines \u039a\u03a5 on the side opposite the sun, it was supposed to have shed its second inequality, which fell to it (in Ptolemy\u2019s opinion) because of the epicycle. Then the planet\u2019s sidereal position was sought out by means of instruments, and the center of the epicycle was supposed to be found at that time on the same line. This was done a number of times and at various places on the zodiac: say, \u039a\u0393, \u039a\u03a5, and the points opposite. From three such positions of the planet (or of the center of the epicycle, which, according to Ptolemy, accounts for the second inequality), the practitioner sets out to investigate the hypothesis for the first inequality by comparing these angles which the observed positions form about \u039a, the center of the earth and of observation, with the intervening times. The method for this enterprise is found in Ptolemy Book IX ^19. Now suppose the treatment done, and let the eccentric's line of apsides come out to be \u039a\u039b\u0394\u03a7, with \u0394 the equalizing point, the center of the eccentric upon this line and at point \u039b, and the eccentric \u03a7\u0396. And let this hypothesis correspond to all positions observed at the times of the planet\u2019s opposition to the sun\u2019s mean position.\nHere, the objections I raised against Copernicus concerning the ordering of the physical motion are also not clearly in agreement with Ptolemy. For the center of the epicycle which accounts for the second inequality, here just as the planet itself previously, is borne slowly or swiftly according to its approach  to or recession from the earth \u039a, performed on the circle \u03a7\u0396. Furthermore, to stipulate that there is in the earth \u039a (just as there was before in Copernicus\u2019s sun, the heart of the world) a motive force that drives the centers of this kind of epicycle around, is absurd and monstrous. The hypothesis can also be discredited by another physical argument. For intrinsic to this form of hypothesis, in one way or another, is solidity of the orbs; and since this has been destroyed (by Tycho Brahe\u2019s observations of comets), the hypothesis appears, so to speak, to collapse under its own weight. For a moving force would be declared to reside in the center of the epicycle (not in a body, but in a mathematical point), and to rouse itself to move from place to place, by an unequal amount in equal times; but at the same time would draw the planet along with itself at the distance of the epicycle\u2019s diameter; all the while causing the planet to gyrate around itself, by equal amounts in equal times. That this enormous variety cannot fall to a single moving mind (unless it be God), Aristotle gives supporting arguments in the Metaphysics Book XII Ch. 8: he holds that the individual minds preside over individual, perfectly uniform and simple circular motions. Besides, how will some power sit in a non-body, and flow out of the non-body into the planet? Even if you divide up the tasks, and locate one motive intelligence at the center of the epicycle and another in the body of the planet, the one at the center will use the earth (a body, of course) as its reference, and will move around the earth nonuniformly in a circle, while the one at a point on the circumference (that is, in the planet's body) will move around an incorporeal center and do so uniformly. The question, then, is (as before), by what aids would it move around the incorporeal point? Not by geometrical imagination, for it does not admit of geometrical imagination of itself. Nor can a mobile point subsist in a non-body even in imagination. We humans, in imagining points of this sort, have recourse to the aids of tablets or paper, which we draw upon with our hands or at least remember ourselves to have drawn once. But it likewise cannot happen through a physical flowing of power (which is in the center of the epicycle) out to the circumference and the planet\u2019s body. For we have submitted to this outflow of power on the supposition that the tasks of the compound motions are divided between two minds. Why not also question whether in the first, eccentric motion, some natural force constituted to produce motion might subsist in some point entirely devoid of any body? And even more, whether this kind of incorporeal power can move itself around the earth, and go from place to place? And most of all, whether it can communicate or transfer another's motion through an efflux from itself, although it is not supported by any body that could serve as its nest? Those sublime considerations of the essence, motion, place, and operations of the blessed angels and of separate minds which some people will want to raise in opposition to me, are irrelevant. For we are arguing about natural things which are far inferior in dignity, about powers that exercise no choice of how to vary their action, and about minds which are not in the least separate, since they are yoked and bound to the celestial bodies which they are to bear. These, then, are the general objections that can be raised against  Ptolemy. \nBut something further may be said to Ptolemy, on account of which in particular he would wish to abandon his mean position of the sun and embrace the apparent with us. For if the power moving the planet (whether single or double) acts with respect to the sun, so that it places the planet at the lowest point of the epicycle whenever the center of the epicycle is opposite the sun, I ask (as above) why it looks to the imaginary point \u03a5 (which sometimes precedes and sometimes follows the sun, here marked \u03a3, and is sometimes above and sometimes below it), rather than the sun's body itself? Or how it is that that power can have any perception whatever of the motion of \u03a5 around the earth K, since there is no body at \u03a8? Is it not more probable that the epicycle is restored to the lines \u039a\u03a3 of the sun\u2019s apparent position, when these pass through the center of the epicycle?\n Let us then see what is changed on the eccentric by substitution of the sun\u2019s apparent position. Again (as before) when the sun \u0393, the center of the sun\u2019s eccentric \u03a8, and the earth \u039a are on the same line, so that the line of the sun\u2019s apparent position \u03a8\u0393 and the line of its mean position \u039a\u0393 coincide, then for the center of the epicycle \u03a4 this place remains the same, whether its sidereal position is designated by \u039a\u03a4 or by \u03a8\u03a4, and the planet is really on the line \u039a\u03a4 or \u03a8\u03a4 and at the lowest point on its epicycle \u03a6, since here it is nearest to both \u03a8 and \u039a. The planet is thereby truly divested of its second inequality. But when the sun comes to the side of its eccentric (that is, to the middle distances), a great enough difference arises. For let the sun have gone from \u0393 to \u03a3, and the line of the sun\u2019s mean position \u039a\u03a5 be found in Aries, and the planet\u2019s line of vision \u039a\u03a9 precisely opposite in Libra, so that \u03a5\u039a\u03a9 is a single line. Now since  Ptolemy declared that the planet \u03a9 on this line of vision \u039a\u03a9 is divested of its second inequality, he places the center of the epicycle \u0396 on the line \u039a\u03a9. But since \u039a\u03a3 has gone beyond \u039a\u03a5, the sun\u2019s apparent position is beyond opposition to the planet. And in the last part of the time, \u039a\u03a9 is not descending, so as to be opposite \u039a\u03a3, but ascends towards \u039a\u03a6, because the lowest parts of the epicycle \u03a9 are retrograde and swifter than the center \u0396, and it is there, of course, that the planet is at opposition to the sun. Therefore, this apparent opposition precedes the mean one.\nTherefore, at some time preceding the moment designated by \u039a\u03a5 (let it be \u039a\u0398) when the sun is seen on the line \u039a\u039e, the planet will be seen opposite it (suppose it to be at \u0399) on \u039a\u0399 which forms a straight line with \u039a\u039e. Also, because it is now laid down that it sheds the second inequality at this true opposition, the center of the epicycle will also be seen on this line \u039e\u039a, say at \u039f. And because the planet is retrograde, at the time \u039a\u0398 prior to \u039a\u03a5 the planet is on the line \u039a\u0399 later than at \u039a\u03a9. But \u039a\u0399 and \u039a\u03a9 are parts of the lines \u039a\u039f and \u039a\u0396. Therefore, \u039a\u039f too is more to the east than \u039a\u0396.\nThus it is clear what would be changed on the line of the epicycle\u2019s center by this restoration from the sun\u2019s mean position to its apparent position. For at \u03a4 and the opposite point on the original line the motions of the epicycle\u2019s center remain unchanged. At \u0396 this line, and the center of the epicycle upon it, is moved forward and a subtraction is made from the intervening time. At the opposite place the contrary happens: an addition is made to the time, and the line of motion of the center of the epicycle is moved back westward. And thus these lines of the center of the epicycle differ much from the original lines. For this reason also, when we investigate the causes and measure of the first inequality by a new and repeated operation using these several observed positions of the center of the epicycle (that is, using the observed positions of the planet, after which we suppose the center of the epicycle to lie upon the same line), the outcome of this operation differs much from that of the preceding one. That is, since the time in the semicircle containing the apogee will have been diminished, so that the planet is correspondingly faster, the eccentricity of the equant will come out smaller. And since in the greater quadrant \u0392\u0396 of the semicircle containing the apogee the time will have been diminished by an amount equal to the diminution in the other, smaller part, the planet has been made proportionally much faster in the remaining part of the semicircle. Therefore, the perigee has come closer to the latter, and the apogee has descended from \u03a7 towards \u0396.\nThe quantification of the new hypothesis will be made clear thus. It is presupposed that the planet \u03a9 falls on the line drawn from the center of the epicycle \u0396 through the earth \u039a, only when \u039a\u0396 is collinear with \u039a\u03a3, the sun\u2019s apparent position. Therefore, \u039a\u03a3 and the line drawn from \u0396 through the body of the planet always proceed in parallel. Moreover, we have just taken it from Ptolemy that at the time when the line of the sun\u2019s mean position was \u039a\u03a5, drawn through \u03a9, the planet was observed on the line \u039a\u03a9, and nonetheless we do not grant him that the center of the epicycle \u0396 is on \u039a\u03a9 at the same time. Therefore, in accord with our position, let a line be drawn from the planet\u2019s position \u03a9 parallel to \u039a\u03a3, and let this be \u03a9\u039f. We are supposing that the center of the epicycle is at this moment on the line \u03a9\u039f, or some other line nearby and parallel, according as \u03a9 (representing the planet) is closer to or farther from \u039a on the line \u039a\u0396. Let \u03a9\u039f be drawn from whatever point on the line \u039a\u0396 (now, it is \u03a9), equal to \u03a9\u0396. From \u039f let a line be drawn to \u0396\u039a parallel to \u039a\u03a8, and let this be \u039f\u0396. Now since \u0396\u03a9\u039f is equal to \u039a\u03a3\u03a8, and \u039a\u03a3 is imperceptibly greater than \u03a8\u03a3  or \u03a9\u039f (because \u039a\u03a8\u03a3 is right, and the angle at \u03a3 is not greater than 2\u00b0 3\u2019, so that if \u03a8\u03a3 is 100,000, \u039a\u03a3 is 100,064), \u039f\u0396 is also imperceptibly less than \u039a\u03a8. Let \u0396\u0394 be joined, and let a line be drawn at \u039f parallel to \u0396\u0394. Now the moment of time at which the center of the epicycle is placed at \u0396 by Ptolemy and at \u039f by me, is the same, and is designated by both of us by the line \u039a\u03a5 in the theory of the sun. In the theory of Mars, that moment should be designated in the former theory by \u0396\u0394, because \u0394 is the point of equality, while in the new theory it will be designated by a line parallel to \u0396\u0394. Therefore, there will be a new point of equality, about which the time is counted, on this parallel through \u039f. ","653":"Now Ptolemy measured out the courses of the planets, not on the lines \u039a\u03a3, but on the lines \u039a\u03a5 drawn from \u039a parallel to the lines \u03a8\u03a3 passing through the sun\u2019s body.

Now since  Ptolemy declared that the planet \u03a9 on this line of vision \u039a\u03a9 is divested of its second inequality, he places the center of the epicycle \u0396 on the line \u039a\u03a9. But since \u039a\u03a3 has gone beyond \u039a\u03a5, the sun\u2019s apparent position is beyond opposition to the planet. And in the last part of the time, \u039a\u03a9 is not descending, so as to be opposite \u039a\u03a3, but ascends towards \u039a\u03a6, because the lowest parts of the epicycle \u03a9 are retrograde and swifter than the center \u0396, and it is there, of course, that the planet is at opposition to the sun. Therefore, this apparent opposition precedes the mean one.\nTherefore, at some time preceding the moment designated by \u039a\u03a5 (let it be \u039a\u0398) when the sun is seen on the line \u039a\u039e, the planet will be seen opposite it (suppose it to be at \u0399) on \u039a\u0399 which forms a straight line with \u039a\u039e. Also, because it is now laid down that it sheds the second inequality at this true opposition, the center of the epicycle will also be seen on this line \u039e\u039a, say at \u039f. And because the planet is retrograde, at the time \u039a\u0398 prior to \u039a\u03a5 the planet is on the line \u039a\u0399 later than at \u039a\u03a9. But \u039a\u0399 and \u039a\u03a9 are parts of the lines \u039a\u039f and \u039a\u0396. Therefore, \u039a\u039f too is more to the east than \u039a\u0396.\nThus it is clear what would be changed on the line of the epicycle\u2019s center by this restoration from the sun\u2019s mean position to its apparent position. For at \u03a4 and the opposite point on the original line the motions of the epicycle\u2019s center remain unchanged. At \u0396 this line, and the center of the epicycle upon it, is moved forward and a subtraction is made from the intervening time. At the opposite place the contrary happens: an addition is made to the time, and the line of motion of the center of the epicycle is moved back westward. And thus these lines of the center of the epicycle differ much from the original lines. For this reason also, when we investigate the causes and measure of the first inequality by a new and repeated operation using these several observed positions of the center of the epicycle (that is, using the observed positions of the planet, after which we suppose the center of the epicycle to lie upon the same line), the outcome of this operation differs much from that of the preceding one. That is, since the time in the semicircle containing the apogee will have been diminished, so that the planet is correspondingly faster, the eccentricity of the equant will come out smaller. And since in the greater quadrant \u0392\u0396 of the semicircle containing the apogee the time will have been diminished by an amount equal to the diminution in the other, smaller part, the planet has been made proportionally much faster in the remaining part of the semicircle. Therefore, the perigee has come closer to the latter, and the apogee has descended from \u03a7 towards \u0396.\nThe quantification of the new hypothesis will be made clear thus. It is presupposed that the planet \u03a9 falls on the line drawn from the center of the epicycle \u0396 through the earth \u039a, only when \u039a\u0396 is collinear with \u039a\u03a3, the sun\u2019s apparent position. Therefore, \u039a\u03a3 and the line drawn from \u0396 through the body of the planet always proceed in parallel. Moreover, we have just taken it from Ptolemy that at the time when the line of the sun\u2019s mean position was \u039a\u03a5, drawn through \u03a9, the planet was observed on the line \u039a\u03a9, and nonetheless we do not grant him that the center of the epicycle \u0396 is on \u039a\u03a9 at the same time. Therefore, in accord with our position, let a line be drawn from the planet\u2019s position \u03a9 parallel to \u039a\u03a3, and let this be \u03a9\u039f. We are supposing that the center of the epicycle is at this moment on the line \u03a9\u039f, or some other line nearby and parallel, according as \u03a9 (representing the planet) is closer to or farther from \u039a on the line \u039a\u0396. Let \u03a9\u039f be drawn from whatever point on the line \u039a\u0396 (now, it is \u03a9), equal to \u03a9\u0396. From \u039f let a line be drawn to \u0396\u039a parallel to \u039a\u03a8, and let this be \u039f\u0396. Now since \u0396\u03a9\u039f is equal to \u039a\u03a3\u03a8, and \u039a\u03a3 is imperceptibly greater than \u03a8\u03a3  or \u03a9\u039f (because \u039a\u03a8\u03a3 is right, and the angle at \u03a3 is not greater than 2\u00b0 3\u2019, so that if \u03a8\u03a3 is 100,000, \u039a\u03a3 is 100,064), \u039f\u0396 is also imperceptibly less than \u039a\u03a8. Let \u0396\u0394 be joined, and let a line be drawn at \u039f parallel to \u0396\u0394. Now the moment of time at which the center of the epicycle is placed at \u0396 by Ptolemy and at \u039f by me, is the same, and is designated by both of us by the line \u039a\u03a5 in the theory of the sun. In the theory of Mars, that moment should be designated in the former theory by \u0396\u0394, because \u0394 is the point of equality, while in the new theory it will be designated by a line parallel to \u0396\u0394. Therefore, there will be a new point of equality, about which the time is counted, on this parallel through \u039f. ","654":"Now Ptolemy measured out the courses of the planets, not on the lines \u039a\u03a3, but on the lines \u039a\u03a5 drawn from \u039a parallel to the lines \u03a8\u03a3 passing through the sun\u2019s body. For whenever the planet fell upon these lines \u039a\u03a5 on the side opposite the sun, it was supposed to have shed its second inequality, which fell to it (in Ptolemy\u2019s opinion) because of the epicycle. Then the planet\u2019s sidereal position was sought out by means of instruments, and the center of the epicycle was supposed to be found at that time on the same line. This was done a number of times and at various places on the zodiac: say, \u039a\u0393, \u039a\u03a5, and the points opposite. From three such positions of the planet (or of the center of the epicycle, which, according to Ptolemy, accounts for the second inequality), the practitioner sets out to investigate the hypothesis for the first inequality by comparing these angles which the observed positions form about \u039a, the center of the earth and of observation, with the intervening times. The method for this enterprise is found in Ptolemy Book IX ^19. Now suppose the treatment done, and let the eccentric's line of apsides come out to be \u039a\u039b\u0394\u03a7, with \u0394 the equalizing point, the center of the eccentric upon this line and at point \u039b, and the eccentric \u03a7\u0396. And let this hypothesis correspond to all positions observed at the times of the planet\u2019s opposition to the sun\u2019s mean position.\nHere, the objections I raised against Copernicus concerning the ordering of the physical motion are also not clearly in agreement with Ptolemy. For the center of the epicycle which accounts for the second inequality, here just as the planet itself previously, is borne slowly or swiftly according to its approach  to or recession from the earth \u039a, performed on the circle \u03a7\u0396. Furthermore, to stipulate that there is in the earth \u039a (just as there was before in Copernicus\u2019s sun, the heart of the world) a motive force that drives the centers of this kind of epicycle around, is absurd and monstrous. The hypothesis can also be discredited by another physical argument. For intrinsic to this form of hypothesis, in one way or another, is solidity of the orbs; and since this has been destroyed (by Tycho Brahe\u2019s observations of comets), the hypothesis appears, so to speak, to collapse under its own weight. For a moving force would be declared to reside in the center of the epicycle (not in a body, but in a mathematical point), and to rouse itself to move from place to place, by an unequal amount in equal times; but at the same time would draw the planet along with itself at the distance of the epicycle\u2019s diameter; all the while causing the planet to gyrate around itself, by equal amounts in equal times. That this enormous variety cannot fall to a single moving mind (unless it be God), Aristotle gives supporting arguments in the Metaphysics Book XII Ch. 8: he holds that the individual minds preside over individual, perfectly uniform and simple circular motions. Besides, how will some power sit in a non-body, and flow out of the non-body into the planet? Even if you divide up the tasks, and locate one motive intelligence at the center of the epicycle and another in the body of the planet, the one at the center will use the earth (a body, of course) as its reference, and will move around the earth nonuniformly in a circle, while the one at a point on the circumference (that is, in the planet's body) will move around an incorporeal center and do so uniformly. The question, then, is (as before), by what aids would it move around the incorporeal point? Not by geometrical imagination, for it does not admit of geometrical imagination of itself. Nor can a mobile point subsist in a non-body even in imagination. We humans, in imagining points of this sort, have recourse to the aids of tablets or paper, which we draw upon with our hands or at least remember ourselves to have drawn once. But it likewise cannot happen through a physical flowing of power (which is in the center of the epicycle) out to the circumference and the planet\u2019s body. For we have submitted to this outflow of power on the supposition that the tasks of the compound motions are divided between two minds. Why not also question whether in the first, eccentric motion, some natural force constituted to produce motion might subsist in some point entirely devoid of any body? And even more, whether this kind of incorporeal power can move itself around the earth, and go from place to place? And most of all, whether it can communicate or transfer another's motion through an efflux from itself, although it is not supported by any body that could serve as its nest? Those sublime considerations of the essence, motion, place, and operations of the blessed angels and of separate minds which some people will want to raise in opposition to me, are irrelevant. For we are arguing about natural things which are far inferior in dignity, about powers that exercise no choice of how to vary their action, and about minds which are not in the least separate, since they are yoked and bound to the celestial bodies which they are to bear. These, then, are the general objections that can be raised against  Ptolemy. \nBut something further may be said to Ptolemy, on account of which in particular he would wish to abandon his mean position of the sun and embrace the apparent with us. For if the power moving the planet (whether single or double) acts with respect to the sun, so that it places the planet at the lowest point of the epicycle whenever the center of the epicycle is opposite the sun, I ask (as above) why it looks to the imaginary point \u03a5 (which sometimes precedes and sometimes follows the sun, here marked \u03a3, and is sometimes above and sometimes below it), rather than the sun's body itself? Or how it is that that power can have any perception whatever of the motion of \u03a5 around the earth K, since there is no body at \u03a8? Is it not more probable that the epicycle is restored to the lines \u039a\u03a3 of the sun\u2019s apparent position, when these pass through the center of the epicycle?\n Let us then see what is changed on the eccentric by substitution of the sun\u2019s apparent position. Again (as before) when the sun \u0393, the center of the sun\u2019s eccentric \u03a8, and the earth \u039a are on the same line, so that the line of the sun\u2019s apparent position \u03a8\u0393 and the line of its mean position \u039a\u0393 coincide, then for the center of the epicycle \u03a4 this place remains the same, whether its sidereal position is designated by \u039a\u03a4 or by \u03a8\u03a4, and the planet is really on the line \u039a\u03a4 or \u03a8\u03a4 and at the lowest point on its epicycle \u03a6, since here it is nearest to both \u03a8 and \u039a. The planet is thereby truly divested of its second inequality. But when the sun comes to the side of its eccentric (that is, to the middle distances), a great enough difference arises. For let the sun have gone from \u0393 to \u03a3, and the line of the sun\u2019s mean position \u039a\u03a5 be found in Aries, and the planet\u2019s line of vision \u039a\u03a9 precisely opposite in Libra, so that \u03a5\u039a\u03a9 is a single line. Now since  Ptolemy declared that the planet \u03a9 on this line of vision \u039a\u03a9 is divested of its second inequality, he places the center of the epicycle \u0396 on the line \u039a\u03a9. But since \u039a\u03a3 has gone beyond \u039a\u03a5, the sun\u2019s apparent position is beyond opposition to the planet. And in the last part of the time, \u039a\u03a9 is not descending, so as to be opposite \u039a\u03a3, but ascends towards \u039a\u03a6, because the lowest parts of the epicycle \u03a9 are retrograde and swifter than the center \u0396, and it is there, of course, that the planet is at opposition to the sun. Therefore, this apparent opposition precedes the mean one.\nTherefore, at some time preceding the moment designated by \u039a\u03a5 (let it be \u039a\u0398) when the sun is seen on the line \u039a\u039e, the planet will be seen opposite it (suppose it to be at \u0399) on \u039a\u0399 which forms a straight line with \u039a\u039e. Also, because it is now laid down that it sheds the second inequality at this true opposition, the center of the epicycle will also be seen on this line \u039e\u039a, say at \u039f. And because the planet is retrograde, at the time \u039a\u0398 prior to \u039a\u03a5 the planet is on the line \u039a\u0399 later than at \u039a\u03a9. But \u039a\u0399 and \u039a\u03a9 are parts of the lines \u039a\u039f and \u039a\u0396. Therefore, \u039a\u039f too is more to the east than \u039a\u0396.\nThus it is clear what would be changed on the line of the epicycle\u2019s center by this restoration from the sun\u2019s mean position to its apparent position. For at \u03a4 and the opposite point on the original line the motions of the epicycle\u2019s center remain unchanged. At \u0396 this line, and the center of the epicycle upon it, is moved forward and a subtraction is made from the intervening time. At the opposite place the contrary happens: an addition is made to the time, and the line of motion of the center of the epicycle is moved back westward. And thus these lines of the center of the epicycle differ much from the original lines. For this reason also, when we investigate the causes and measure of the first inequality by a new and repeated operation using these several observed positions of the center of the epicycle (that is, using the observed positions of the planet, after which we suppose the center of the epicycle to lie upon the same line), the outcome of this operation differs much from that of the preceding one. That is, since the time in the semicircle containing the apogee will have been diminished, so that the planet is correspondingly faster, the eccentricity of the equant will come out smaller. And since in the greater quadrant \u0392\u0396 of the semicircle containing the apogee the time will have been diminished by an amount equal to the diminution in the other, smaller part, the planet has been made proportionally much faster in the remaining part of the semicircle. Therefore, the perigee has come closer to the latter, and the apogee has descended from \u03a7 towards \u0396.\nThe quantification of the new hypothesis will be made clear thus. It is presupposed that the planet \u03a9 falls on the line drawn from the center of the epicycle \u0396 through the earth \u039a, only when \u039a\u0396 is collinear with \u039a\u03a3, the sun\u2019s apparent position. Therefore, \u039a\u03a3 and the line drawn from \u0396 through the body of the planet always proceed in parallel. Moreover, we have just taken it from Ptolemy that at the time when the line of the sun\u2019s mean position was \u039a\u03a5, drawn through \u03a9, the planet was observed on the line \u039a\u03a9, and nonetheless we do not grant him that the center of the epicycle \u0396 is on \u039a\u03a9 at the same time. Therefore, in accord with our position, let a line be drawn from the planet\u2019s position \u03a9 parallel to \u039a\u03a3, and let this be \u03a9\u039f. We are supposing that the center of the epicycle is at this moment on the line \u03a9\u039f, or some other line nearby and parallel, according as \u03a9 (representing the planet) is closer to or farther from \u039a on the line \u039a\u0396. Let \u03a9\u039f be drawn from whatever point on the line \u039a\u0396 (now, it is \u03a9), equal to \u03a9\u0396. From \u039f let a line be drawn to \u0396\u039a parallel to \u039a\u03a8, and let this be \u039f\u0396. Now since \u0396\u03a9\u039f is equal to \u039a\u03a3\u03a8, and \u039a\u03a3 is imperceptibly greater than \u03a8\u03a3  or \u03a9\u039f (because \u039a\u03a8\u03a3 is right, and the angle at \u03a3 is not greater than 2\u00b0 3\u2019, so that if \u03a8\u03a3 is 100,000, \u039a\u03a3 is 100,064), \u039f\u0396 is also imperceptibly less than \u039a\u03a8. Let \u0396\u0394 be joined, and let a line be drawn at \u039f parallel to \u0396\u0394. Now the moment of time at which the center of the epicycle is placed at \u0396 by Ptolemy and at \u039f by me, is the same, and is designated by both of us by the line \u039a\u03a5 in the theory of the sun. In the theory of Mars, that moment should be designated in the former theory by \u0396\u0394, because \u0394 is the point of equality, while in the new theory it will be designated by a line parallel to \u0396\u0394. Therefore, there will be a new point of equality, about which the time is counted, on this parallel through \u039f. ","655":"Now Ptolemy measured out the courses of the planets, not on the lines \u039a\u03a3, but on the lines \u039a\u03a5 drawn from \u039a parallel to the lines \u03a8\u03a3 passing through the sun\u2019s body.

Is it not more probable that the epicycle is restored to the lines \u039a\u03a3 of the sun\u2019s apparent position, when these pass through the center of the epicycle?\n Let us then see what is changed on the eccentric by substitution of the sun\u2019s apparent position. Again (as before) when the sun \u0393, the center of the sun\u2019s eccentric \u03a8, and the earth \u039a are on the same line, so that the line of the sun\u2019s apparent position \u03a8\u0393 and the line of its mean position \u039a\u0393 coincide, then for the center of the epicycle \u03a4 this place remains the same, whether its sidereal position is designated by \u039a\u03a4 or by \u03a8\u03a4, and the planet is really on the line \u039a\u03a4 or \u03a8\u03a4 and at the lowest point on its epicycle \u03a6, since here it is nearest to both \u03a8 and \u039a. The planet is thereby truly divested of its second inequality. But when the sun comes to the side of its eccentric (that is, to the middle distances), a great enough difference arises. For let the sun have gone from \u0393 to \u03a3, and the line of the sun\u2019s mean position \u039a\u03a5 be found in Aries, and the planet\u2019s line of vision \u039a\u03a9 precisely opposite in Libra, so that \u03a5\u039a\u03a9 is a single line. Now since  Ptolemy declared that the planet \u03a9 on this line of vision \u039a\u03a9 is divested of its second inequality, he places the center of the epicycle \u0396 on the line \u039a\u03a9. But since \u039a\u03a3 has gone beyond \u039a\u03a5, the sun\u2019s apparent position is beyond opposition to the planet. And in the last part of the time, \u039a\u03a9 is not descending, so as to be opposite \u039a\u03a3, but ascends towards \u039a\u03a6, because the lowest parts of the epicycle \u03a9 are retrograde and swifter than the center \u0396, and it is there, of course, that the planet is at opposition to the sun. Therefore, this apparent opposition precedes the mean one.\nTherefore, at some time preceding the moment designated by \u039a\u03a5 (let it be \u039a\u0398) when the sun is seen on the line \u039a\u039e, the planet will be seen opposite it (suppose it to be at \u0399) on \u039a\u0399 which forms a straight line with \u039a\u039e. Also, because it is now laid down that it sheds the second inequality at this true opposition, the center of the epicycle will also be seen on this line \u039e\u039a, say at \u039f. And because the planet is retrograde, at the time \u039a\u0398 prior to \u039a\u03a5 the planet is on the line \u039a\u0399 later than at \u039a\u03a9. But \u039a\u0399 and \u039a\u03a9 are parts of the lines \u039a\u039f and \u039a\u0396. Therefore, \u039a\u039f too is more to the east than \u039a\u0396.\nThus it is clear what would be changed on the line of the epicycle\u2019s center by this restoration from the sun\u2019s mean position to its apparent position. For at \u03a4 and the opposite point on the original line the motions of the epicycle\u2019s center remain unchanged. At \u0396 this line, and the center of the epicycle upon it, is moved forward and a subtraction is made from the intervening time. At the opposite place the contrary happens: an addition is made to the time, and the line of motion of the center of the epicycle is moved back westward. And thus these lines of the center of the epicycle differ much from the original lines. For this reason also, when we investigate the causes and measure of the first inequality by a new and repeated operation using these several observed positions of the center of the epicycle (that is, using the observed positions of the planet, after which we suppose the center of the epicycle to lie upon the same line), the outcome of this operation differs much from that of the preceding one. That is, since the time in the semicircle containing the apogee will have been diminished, so that the planet is correspondingly faster, the eccentricity of the equant will come out smaller. And since in the greater quadrant \u0392\u0396 of the semicircle containing the apogee the time will have been diminished by an amount equal to the diminution in the other, smaller part, the planet has been made proportionally much faster in the remaining part of the semicircle. Therefore, the perigee has come closer to the latter, and the apogee has descended from \u03a7 towards \u0396.\nThe quantification of the new hypothesis will be made clear thus. It is presupposed that the planet \u03a9 falls on the line drawn from the center of the epicycle \u0396 through the earth \u039a, only when \u039a\u0396 is collinear with \u039a\u03a3, the sun\u2019s apparent position. Therefore, \u039a\u03a3 and the line drawn from \u0396 through the body of the planet always proceed in parallel. Moreover, we have just taken it from Ptolemy that at the time when the line of the sun\u2019s mean position was \u039a\u03a5, drawn through \u03a9, the planet was observed on the line \u039a\u03a9, and nonetheless we do not grant him that the center of the epicycle \u0396 is on \u039a\u03a9 at the same time. Therefore, in accord with our position, let a line be drawn from the planet\u2019s position \u03a9 parallel to \u039a\u03a3, and let this be \u03a9\u039f. We are supposing that the center of the epicycle is at this moment on the line \u03a9\u039f, or some other line nearby and parallel, according as \u03a9 (representing the planet) is closer to or farther from \u039a on the line \u039a\u0396. Let \u03a9\u039f be drawn from whatever point on the line \u039a\u0396 (now, it is \u03a9), equal to \u03a9\u0396. From \u039f let a line be drawn to \u0396\u039a parallel to \u039a\u03a8, and let this be \u039f\u0396. Now since \u0396\u03a9\u039f is equal to \u039a\u03a3\u03a8, and \u039a\u03a3 is imperceptibly greater than \u03a8\u03a3  or \u03a9\u039f (because \u039a\u03a8\u03a3 is right, and the angle at \u03a3 is not greater than 2\u00b0 3\u2019, so that if \u03a8\u03a3 is 100,000, \u039a\u03a3 is 100,064), \u039f\u0396 is also imperceptibly less than \u039a\u03a8. Let \u0396\u0394 be joined, and let a line be drawn at \u039f parallel to \u0396\u0394. Now the moment of time at which the center of the epicycle is placed at \u0396 by Ptolemy and at \u039f by me, is the same, and is designated by both of us by the line \u039a\u03a5 in the theory of the sun. In the theory of Mars, that moment should be designated in the former theory by \u0396\u0394, because \u0394 is the point of equality, while in the new theory it will be designated by a line parallel to \u0396\u0394. Therefore, there will be a new point of equality, about which the time is counted, on this parallel through \u039f. ","656":"Now Ptolemy measured out the courses of the planets, not on the lines \u039a\u03a3, but on the lines \u039a\u03a5 drawn from \u039a parallel to the lines \u03a8\u03a3 passing through the sun\u2019s body. For whenever the planet fell upon these lines \u039a\u03a5 on the side opposite the sun, it was supposed to have shed its second inequality, which fell to it (in Ptolemy\u2019s opinion) because of the epicycle. Then the planet\u2019s sidereal position was sought out by means of instruments, and the center of the epicycle was supposed to be found at that time on the same line. This was done a number of times and at various places on the zodiac: say, \u039a\u0393, \u039a\u03a5, and the points opposite. From three such positions of the planet (or of the center of the epicycle, which, according to Ptolemy, accounts for the second inequality), the practitioner sets out to investigate the hypothesis for the first inequality by comparing these angles which the observed positions form about \u039a, the center of the earth and of observation, with the intervening times. The method for this enterprise is found in Ptolemy Book IX ^19. Now suppose the treatment done, and let the eccentric's line of apsides come out to be \u039a\u039b\u0394\u03a7, with \u0394 the equalizing point, the center of the eccentric upon this line and at point \u039b, and the eccentric \u03a7\u0396. And let this hypothesis correspond to all positions observed at the times of the planet\u2019s opposition to the sun\u2019s mean position.\nHere, the objections I raised against Copernicus concerning the ordering of the physical motion are also not clearly in agreement with Ptolemy. For the center of the epicycle which accounts for the second inequality, here just as the planet itself previously, is borne slowly or swiftly according to its approach  to or recession from the earth \u039a, performed on the circle \u03a7\u0396. Furthermore, to stipulate that there is in the earth \u039a (just as there was before in Copernicus\u2019s sun, the heart of the world) a motive force that drives the centers of this kind of epicycle around, is absurd and monstrous. The hypothesis can also be discredited by another physical argument. For intrinsic to this form of hypothesis, in one way or another, is solidity of the orbs; and since this has been destroyed (by Tycho Brahe\u2019s observations of comets), the hypothesis appears, so to speak, to collapse under its own weight. For a moving force would be declared to reside in the center of the epicycle (not in a body, but in a mathematical point), and to rouse itself to move from place to place, by an unequal amount in equal times; but at the same time would draw the planet along with itself at the distance of the epicycle\u2019s diameter; all the while causing the planet to gyrate around itself, by equal amounts in equal times. That this enormous variety cannot fall to a single moving mind (unless it be God), Aristotle gives supporting arguments in the Metaphysics Book XII Ch. 8: he holds that the individual minds preside over individual, perfectly uniform and simple circular motions. Besides, how will some power sit in a non-body, and flow out of the non-body into the planet? Even if you divide up the tasks, and locate one motive intelligence at the center of the epicycle and another in the body of the planet, the one at the center will use the earth (a body, of course) as its reference, and will move around the earth nonuniformly in a circle, while the one at a point on the circumference (that is, in the planet's body) will move around an incorporeal center and do so uniformly. The question, then, is (as before), by what aids would it move around the incorporeal point? Not by geometrical imagination, for it does not admit of geometrical imagination of itself. Nor can a mobile point subsist in a non-body even in imagination. We humans, in imagining points of this sort, have recourse to the aids of tablets or paper, which we draw upon with our hands or at least remember ourselves to have drawn once. But it likewise cannot happen through a physical flowing of power (which is in the center of the epicycle) out to the circumference and the planet\u2019s body. For we have submitted to this outflow of power on the supposition that the tasks of the compound motions are divided between two minds. Why not also question whether in the first, eccentric motion, some natural force constituted to produce motion might subsist in some point entirely devoid of any body? And even more, whether this kind of incorporeal power can move itself around the earth, and go from place to place? And most of all, whether it can communicate or transfer another's motion through an efflux from itself, although it is not supported by any body that could serve as its nest? Those sublime considerations of the essence, motion, place, and operations of the blessed angels and of separate minds which some people will want to raise in opposition to me, are irrelevant. For we are arguing about natural things which are far inferior in dignity, about powers that exercise no choice of how to vary their action, and about minds which are not in the least separate, since they are yoked and bound to the celestial bodies which they are to bear. These, then, are the general objections that can be raised against  Ptolemy. \nBut something further may be said to Ptolemy, on account of which in particular he would wish to abandon his mean position of the sun and embrace the apparent with us. For if the power moving the planet (whether single or double) acts with respect to the sun, so that it places the planet at the lowest point of the epicycle whenever the center of the epicycle is opposite the sun, I ask (as above) why it looks to the imaginary point \u03a5 (which sometimes precedes and sometimes follows the sun, here marked \u03a3, and is sometimes above and sometimes below it), rather than the sun's body itself? Or how it is that that power can have any perception whatever of the motion of \u03a5 around the earth K, since there is no body at \u03a8? Is it not more probable that the epicycle is restored to the lines \u039a\u03a3 of the sun\u2019s apparent position, when these pass through the center of the epicycle?\n Let us then see what is changed on the eccentric by substitution of the sun\u2019s apparent position. Again (as before) when the sun \u0393, the center of the sun\u2019s eccentric \u03a8, and the earth \u039a are on the same line, so that the line of the sun\u2019s apparent position \u03a8\u0393 and the line of its mean position \u039a\u0393 coincide, then for the center of the epicycle \u03a4 this place remains the same, whether its sidereal position is designated by \u039a\u03a4 or by \u03a8\u03a4, and the planet is really on the line \u039a\u03a4 or \u03a8\u03a4 and at the lowest point on its epicycle \u03a6, since here it is nearest to both \u03a8 and \u039a. The planet is thereby truly divested of its second inequality. But when the sun comes to the side of its eccentric (that is, to the middle distances), a great enough difference arises. For let the sun have gone from \u0393 to \u03a3, and the line of the sun\u2019s mean position \u039a\u03a5 be found in Aries, and the planet\u2019s line of vision \u039a\u03a9 precisely opposite in Libra, so that \u03a5\u039a\u03a9 is a single line. Now since  Ptolemy declared that the planet \u03a9 on this line of vision \u039a\u03a9 is divested of its second inequality, he places the center of the epicycle \u0396 on the line \u039a\u03a9. But since \u039a\u03a3 has gone beyond \u039a\u03a5, the sun\u2019s apparent position is beyond opposition to the planet. And in the last part of the time, \u039a\u03a9 is not descending, so as to be opposite \u039a\u03a3, but ascends towards \u039a\u03a6, because the lowest parts of the epicycle \u03a9 are retrograde and swifter than the center \u0396, and it is there, of course, that the planet is at opposition to the sun. Therefore, this apparent opposition precedes the mean one.\nTherefore, at some time preceding the moment designated by \u039a\u03a5 (let it be \u039a\u0398) when the sun is seen on the line \u039a\u039e, the planet will be seen opposite it (suppose it to be at \u0399) on \u039a\u0399 which forms a straight line with \u039a\u039e. Also, because it is now laid down that it sheds the second inequality at this true opposition, the center of the epicycle will also be seen on this line \u039e\u039a, say at \u039f. And because the planet is retrograde, at the time \u039a\u0398 prior to \u039a\u03a5 the planet is on the line \u039a\u0399 later than at \u039a\u03a9. But \u039a\u0399 and \u039a\u03a9 are parts of the lines \u039a\u039f and \u039a\u0396. Therefore, \u039a\u039f too is more to the east than \u039a\u0396.\nThus it is clear what would be changed on the line of the epicycle\u2019s center by this restoration from the sun\u2019s mean position to its apparent position. For at \u03a4 and the opposite point on the original line the motions of the epicycle\u2019s center remain unchanged. At \u0396 this line, and the center of the epicycle upon it, is moved forward and a subtraction is made from the intervening time. At the opposite place the contrary happens: an addition is made to the time, and the line of motion of the center of the epicycle is moved back westward. And thus these lines of the center of the epicycle differ much from the original lines. For this reason also, when we investigate the causes and measure of the first inequality by a new and repeated operation using these several observed positions of the center of the epicycle (that is, using the observed positions of the planet, after which we suppose the center of the epicycle to lie upon the same line), the outcome of this operation differs much from that of the preceding one. That is, since the time in the semicircle containing the apogee will have been diminished, so that the planet is correspondingly faster, the eccentricity of the equant will come out smaller. And since in the greater quadrant \u0392\u0396 of the semicircle containing the apogee the time will have been diminished by an amount equal to the diminution in the other, smaller part, the planet has been made proportionally much faster in the remaining part of the semicircle. Therefore, the perigee has come closer to the latter, and the apogee has descended from \u03a7 towards \u0396.\nThe quantification of the new hypothesis will be made clear thus. It is presupposed that the planet \u03a9 falls on the line drawn from the center of the epicycle \u0396 through the earth \u039a, only when \u039a\u0396 is collinear with \u039a\u03a3, the sun\u2019s apparent position. Therefore, \u039a\u03a3 and the line drawn from \u0396 through the body of the planet always proceed in parallel. Moreover, we have just taken it from Ptolemy that at the time when the line of the sun\u2019s mean position was \u039a\u03a5, drawn through \u03a9, the planet was observed on the line \u039a\u03a9, and nonetheless we do not grant him that the center of the epicycle \u0396 is on \u039a\u03a9 at the same time. Therefore, in accord with our position, let a line be drawn from the planet\u2019s position \u03a9 parallel to \u039a\u03a3, and let this be \u03a9\u039f. We are supposing that the center of the epicycle is at this moment on the line \u03a9\u039f, or some other line nearby and parallel, according as \u03a9 (representing the planet) is closer to or farther from \u039a on the line \u039a\u0396. Let \u03a9\u039f be drawn from whatever point on the line \u039a\u0396 (now, it is \u03a9), equal to \u03a9\u0396. From \u039f let a line be drawn to \u0396\u039a parallel to \u039a\u03a8, and let this be \u039f\u0396. Now since \u0396\u03a9\u039f is equal to \u039a\u03a3\u03a8, and \u039a\u03a3 is imperceptibly greater than \u03a8\u03a3  or \u03a9\u039f (because \u039a\u03a8\u03a3 is right, and the angle at \u03a3 is not greater than 2\u00b0 3\u2019, so that if \u03a8\u03a3 is 100,000, \u039a\u03a3 is 100,064), \u039f\u0396 is also imperceptibly less than \u039a\u03a8. Let \u0396\u0394 be joined, and let a line be drawn at \u039f parallel to \u0396\u0394. Now the moment of time at which the center of the epicycle is placed at \u0396 by Ptolemy and at \u039f by me, is the same, and is designated by both of us by the line \u039a\u03a5 in the theory of the sun. In the theory of Mars, that moment should be designated in the former theory by \u0396\u0394, because \u0394 is the point of equality, while in the new theory it will be designated by a line parallel to \u0396\u0394. Therefore, there will be a new point of equality, about which the time is counted, on this parallel through \u039f. ","657":"Now Ptolemy measured out the courses of the planets, not on the lines \u039a\u03a3, but on the lines \u039a\u03a5 drawn from \u039a parallel to the lines \u03a8\u03a3 passing through the sun\u2019s body.

Is it not more probable that the epicycle is restored to the lines \u039a\u03a3 of the sun\u2019s apparent position, when these pass through the center of the epicycle?\n Let us then see what is changed on the eccentric by substitution of the sun\u2019s apparent position. Again (as before) when the sun \u0393, the center of the sun\u2019s eccentric \u03a8, and the earth \u039a are on the same line, so that the line of the sun\u2019s apparent position \u03a8\u0393 and the line of its mean position \u039a\u0393 coincide, then for the center of the epicycle \u03a4 this place remains the same, whether its sidereal position is designated by \u039a\u03a4 or by \u03a8\u03a4, and the planet is really on the line \u039a\u03a4 or \u03a8\u03a4 and at the lowest point on its epicycle \u03a6, since here it is nearest to both \u03a8 and \u039a. The planet is thereby truly divested of its second inequality. But when the sun comes to the side of its eccentric (that is, to the middle distances), a great enough difference arises. For let the sun have gone from \u0393 to \u03a3, and the line of the sun\u2019s mean position \u039a\u03a5 be found in Aries, and the planet\u2019s line of vision \u039a\u03a9 precisely opposite in Libra, so that \u03a5\u039a\u03a9 is a single line. Now since  Ptolemy declared that the planet \u03a9 on this line of vision \u039a\u03a9 is divested of its second inequality, he places the center of the epicycle \u0396 on the line \u039a\u03a9. But since \u039a\u03a3 has gone beyond \u039a\u03a5, the sun\u2019s apparent position is beyond opposition to the planet. And in the last part of the time, \u039a\u03a9 is not descending, so as to be opposite \u039a\u03a3, but ascends towards \u039a\u03a6, because the lowest parts of the epicycle \u03a9 are retrograde and swifter than the center \u0396, and it is there, of course, that the planet is at opposition to the sun. Therefore, this apparent opposition precedes the mean one.\nTherefore, at some time preceding the moment designated by \u039a\u03a5 (let it be \u039a\u0398) when the sun is seen on the line \u039a\u039e, the planet will be seen opposite it (suppose it to be at \u0399) on \u039a\u0399 which forms a straight line with \u039a\u039e. Also, because it is now laid down that it sheds the second inequality at this true opposition, the center of the epicycle will also be seen on this line \u039e\u039a, say at \u039f. And because the planet is retrograde, at the time \u039a\u0398 prior to \u039a\u03a5 the planet is on the line \u039a\u0399 later than at \u039a\u03a9. But \u039a\u0399 and \u039a\u03a9 are parts of the lines \u039a\u039f and \u039a\u0396. Therefore, \u039a\u039f too is more to the east than \u039a\u0396.\nThus it is clear what would be changed on the line of the epicycle\u2019s center by this restoration from the sun\u2019s mean position to its apparent position. For at \u03a4 and the opposite point on the original line the motions of the epicycle\u2019s center remain unchanged. At \u0396 this line, and the center of the epicycle upon it, is moved forward and a subtraction is made from the intervening time. At the opposite place the contrary happens: an addition is made to the time, and the line of motion of the center of the epicycle is moved back westward. And thus these lines of the center of the epicycle differ much from the original lines. For this reason also, when we investigate the causes and measure of the first inequality by a new and repeated operation using these several observed positions of the center of the epicycle (that is, using the observed positions of the planet, after which we suppose the center of the epicycle to lie upon the same line), the outcome of this operation differs much from that of the preceding one. That is, since the time in the semicircle containing the apogee will have been diminished, so that the planet is correspondingly faster, the eccentricity of the equant will come out smaller. And since in the greater quadrant \u0392\u0396 of the semicircle containing the apogee the time will have been diminished by an amount equal to the diminution in the other, smaller part, the planet has been made proportionally much faster in the remaining part of the semicircle. Therefore, the perigee has come closer to the latter, and the apogee has descended from \u03a7 towards \u0396.\nThe quantification of the new hypothesis will be made clear thus. It is presupposed that the planet \u03a9 falls on the line drawn from the center of the epicycle \u0396 through the earth \u039a, only when \u039a\u0396 is collinear with \u039a\u03a3, the sun\u2019s apparent position. Therefore, \u039a\u03a3 and the line drawn from \u0396 through the body of the planet always proceed in parallel. Moreover, we have just taken it from Ptolemy that at the time when the line of the sun\u2019s mean position was \u039a\u03a5, drawn through \u03a9, the planet was observed on the line \u039a\u03a9, and nonetheless we do not grant him that the center of the epicycle \u0396 is on \u039a\u03a9 at the same time. Therefore, in accord with our position, let a line be drawn from the planet\u2019s position \u03a9 parallel to \u039a\u03a3, and let this be \u03a9\u039f. We are supposing that the center of the epicycle is at this moment on the line \u03a9\u039f, or some other line nearby and parallel, according as \u03a9 (representing the planet) is closer to or farther from \u039a on the line \u039a\u0396. Let \u03a9\u039f be drawn from whatever point on the line \u039a\u0396 (now, it is \u03a9), equal to \u03a9\u0396. From \u039f let a line be drawn to \u0396\u039a parallel to \u039a\u03a8, and let this be \u039f\u0396. Now since \u0396\u03a9\u039f is equal to \u039a\u03a3\u03a8, and \u039a\u03a3 is imperceptibly greater than \u03a8\u03a3  or \u03a9\u039f (because \u039a\u03a8\u03a3 is right, and the angle at \u03a3 is not greater than 2\u00b0 3\u2019, so that if \u03a8\u03a3 is 100,000, \u039a\u03a3 is 100,064), \u039f\u0396 is also imperceptibly less than \u039a\u03a8. Let \u0396\u0394 be joined, and let a line be drawn at \u039f parallel to \u0396\u0394. Now the moment of time at which the center of the epicycle is placed at \u0396 by Ptolemy and at \u039f by me, is the same, and is designated by both of us by the line \u039a\u03a5 in the theory of the sun. In the theory of Mars, that moment should be designated in the former theory by \u0396\u0394, because \u0394 is the point of equality, while in the new theory it will be designated by a line parallel to \u0396\u0394. Therefore, there will be a new point of equality, about which the time is counted, on this parallel through \u039f. ","658":"Now Ptolemy measured out the courses of the planets, not on the lines \u039a\u03a3, but on the lines \u039a\u03a5 drawn from \u039a parallel to the lines \u03a8\u03a3 passing through the sun\u2019s body. For whenever the planet fell upon these lines \u039a\u03a5 on the side opposite the sun, it was supposed to have shed its second inequality, which fell to it (in Ptolemy\u2019s opinion) because of the epicycle. Then the planet\u2019s sidereal position was sought out by means of instruments, and the center of the epicycle was supposed to be found at that time on the same line. This was done a number of times and at various places on the zodiac: say, \u039a\u0393, \u039a\u03a5, and the points opposite. From three such positions of the planet (or of the center of the epicycle, which, according to Ptolemy, accounts for the second inequality), the practitioner sets out to investigate the hypothesis for the first inequality by comparing these angles which the observed positions form about \u039a, the center of the earth and of observation, with the intervening times. The method for this enterprise is found in Ptolemy Book IX ^19. Now suppose the treatment done, and let the eccentric's line of apsides come out to be \u039a\u039b\u0394\u03a7, with \u0394 the equalizing point, the center of the eccentric upon this line and at point \u039b, and the eccentric \u03a7\u0396. And let this hypothesis correspond to all positions observed at the times of the planet\u2019s opposition to the sun\u2019s mean position.\nHere, the objections I raised against Copernicus concerning the ordering of the physical motion are also not clearly in agreement with Ptolemy. For the center of the epicycle which accounts for the second inequality, here just as the planet itself previously, is borne slowly or swiftly according to its approach  to or recession from the earth \u039a, performed on the circle \u03a7\u0396. Furthermore, to stipulate that there is in the earth \u039a (just as there was before in Copernicus\u2019s sun, the heart of the world) a motive force that drives the centers of this kind of epicycle around, is absurd and monstrous. The hypothesis can also be discredited by another physical argument. For intrinsic to this form of hypothesis, in one way or another, is solidity of the orbs; and since this has been destroyed (by Tycho Brahe\u2019s observations of comets), the hypothesis appears, so to speak, to collapse under its own weight. For a moving force would be declared to reside in the center of the epicycle (not in a body, but in a mathematical point), and to rouse itself to move from place to place, by an unequal amount in equal times; but at the same time would draw the planet along with itself at the distance of the epicycle\u2019s diameter; all the while causing the planet to gyrate around itself, by equal amounts in equal times. That this enormous variety cannot fall to a single moving mind (unless it be God), Aristotle gives supporting arguments in the Metaphysics Book XII Ch. 8: he holds that the individual minds preside over individual, perfectly uniform and simple circular motions. Besides, how will some power sit in a non-body, and flow out of the non-body into the planet? Even if you divide up the tasks, and locate one motive intelligence at the center of the epicycle and another in the body of the planet, the one at the center will use the earth (a body, of course) as its reference, and will move around the earth nonuniformly in a circle, while the one at a point on the circumference (that is, in the planet's body) will move around an incorporeal center and do so uniformly. The question, then, is (as before), by what aids would it move around the incorporeal point? Not by geometrical imagination, for it does not admit of geometrical imagination of itself. Nor can a mobile point subsist in a non-body even in imagination. We humans, in imagining points of this sort, have recourse to the aids of tablets or paper, which we draw upon with our hands or at least remember ourselves to have drawn once. But it likewise cannot happen through a physical flowing of power (which is in the center of the epicycle) out to the circumference and the planet\u2019s body. For we have submitted to this outflow of power on the supposition that the tasks of the compound motions are divided between two minds. Why not also question whether in the first, eccentric motion, some natural force constituted to produce motion might subsist in some point entirely devoid of any body? And even more, whether this kind of incorporeal power can move itself around the earth, and go from place to place? And most of all, whether it can communicate or transfer another's motion through an efflux from itself, although it is not supported by any body that could serve as its nest? Those sublime considerations of the essence, motion, place, and operations of the blessed angels and of separate minds which some people will want to raise in opposition to me, are irrelevant. For we are arguing about natural things which are far inferior in dignity, about powers that exercise no choice of how to vary their action, and about minds which are not in the least separate, since they are yoked and bound to the celestial bodies which they are to bear. These, then, are the general objections that can be raised against  Ptolemy. \nBut something further may be said to Ptolemy, on account of which in particular he would wish to abandon his mean position of the sun and embrace the apparent with us. For if the power moving the planet (whether single or double) acts with respect to the sun, so that it places the planet at the lowest point of the epicycle whenever the center of the epicycle is opposite the sun, I ask (as above) why it looks to the imaginary point \u03a5 (which sometimes precedes and sometimes follows the sun, here marked \u03a3, and is sometimes above and sometimes below it), rather than the sun's body itself? Or how it is that that power can have any perception whatever of the motion of \u03a5 around the earth K, since there is no body at \u03a8? Is it not more probable that the epicycle is restored to the lines \u039a\u03a3 of the sun\u2019s apparent position, when these pass through the center of the epicycle?\n Let us then see what is changed on the eccentric by substitution of the sun\u2019s apparent position. Again (as before) when the sun \u0393, the center of the sun\u2019s eccentric \u03a8, and the earth \u039a are on the same line, so that the line of the sun\u2019s apparent position \u03a8\u0393 and the line of its mean position \u039a\u0393 coincide, then for the center of the epicycle \u03a4 this place remains the same, whether its sidereal position is designated by \u039a\u03a4 or by \u03a8\u03a4, and the planet is really on the line \u039a\u03a4 or \u03a8\u03a4 and at the lowest point on its epicycle \u03a6, since here it is nearest to both \u03a8 and \u039a. The planet is thereby truly divested of its second inequality. But when the sun comes to the side of its eccentric (that is, to the middle distances), a great enough difference arises. For let the sun have gone from \u0393 to \u03a3, and the line of the sun\u2019s mean position \u039a\u03a5 be found in Aries, and the planet\u2019s line of vision \u039a\u03a9 precisely opposite in Libra, so that \u03a5\u039a\u03a9 is a single line. Now since  Ptolemy declared that the planet \u03a9 on this line of vision \u039a\u03a9 is divested of its second inequality, he places the center of the epicycle \u0396 on the line \u039a\u03a9. But since \u039a\u03a3 has gone beyond \u039a\u03a5, the sun\u2019s apparent position is beyond opposition to the planet. And in the last part of the time, \u039a\u03a9 is not descending, so as to be opposite \u039a\u03a3, but ascends towards \u039a\u03a6, because the lowest parts of the epicycle \u03a9 are retrograde and swifter than the center \u0396, and it is there, of course, that the planet is at opposition to the sun. Therefore, this apparent opposition precedes the mean one.\nTherefore, at some time preceding the moment designated by \u039a\u03a5 (let it be \u039a\u0398) when the sun is seen on the line \u039a\u039e, the planet will be seen opposite it (suppose it to be at \u0399) on \u039a\u0399 which forms a straight line with \u039a\u039e. Also, because it is now laid down that it sheds the second inequality at this true opposition, the center of the epicycle will also be seen on this line \u039e\u039a, say at \u039f. And because the planet is retrograde, at the time \u039a\u0398 prior to \u039a\u03a5 the planet is on the line \u039a\u0399 later than at \u039a\u03a9. But \u039a\u0399 and \u039a\u03a9 are parts of the lines \u039a\u039f and \u039a\u0396. Therefore, \u039a\u039f too is more to the east than \u039a\u0396.\nThus it is clear what would be changed on the line of the epicycle\u2019s center by this restoration from the sun\u2019s mean position to its apparent position. For at \u03a4 and the opposite point on the original line the motions of the epicycle\u2019s center remain unchanged. At \u0396 this line, and the center of the epicycle upon it, is moved forward and a subtraction is made from the intervening time. At the opposite place the contrary happens: an addition is made to the time, and the line of motion of the center of the epicycle is moved back westward. And thus these lines of the center of the epicycle differ much from the original lines. For this reason also, when we investigate the causes and measure of the first inequality by a new and repeated operation using these several observed positions of the center of the epicycle (that is, using the observed positions of the planet, after which we suppose the center of the epicycle to lie upon the same line), the outcome of this operation differs much from that of the preceding one. That is, since the time in the semicircle containing the apogee will have been diminished, so that the planet is correspondingly faster, the eccentricity of the equant will come out smaller. And since in the greater quadrant \u0392\u0396 of the semicircle containing the apogee the time will have been diminished by an amount equal to the diminution in the other, smaller part, the planet has been made proportionally much faster in the remaining part of the semicircle. Therefore, the perigee has come closer to the latter, and the apogee has descended from \u03a7 towards \u0396.\nThe quantification of the new hypothesis will be made clear thus. It is presupposed that the planet \u03a9 falls on the line drawn from the center of the epicycle \u0396 through the earth \u039a, only when \u039a\u0396 is collinear with \u039a\u03a3, the sun\u2019s apparent position. Therefore, \u039a\u03a3 and the line drawn from \u0396 through the body of the planet always proceed in parallel. Moreover, we have just taken it from Ptolemy that at the time when the line of the sun\u2019s mean position was \u039a\u03a5, drawn through \u03a9, the planet was observed on the line \u039a\u03a9, and nonetheless we do not grant him that the center of the epicycle \u0396 is on \u039a\u03a9 at the same time. Therefore, in accord with our position, let a line be drawn from the planet\u2019s position \u03a9 parallel to \u039a\u03a3, and let this be \u03a9\u039f. We are supposing that the center of the epicycle is at this moment on the line \u03a9\u039f, or some other line nearby and parallel, according as \u03a9 (representing the planet) is closer to or farther from \u039a on the line \u039a\u0396. Let \u03a9\u039f be drawn from whatever point on the line \u039a\u0396 (now, it is \u03a9), equal to \u03a9\u0396. From \u039f let a line be drawn to \u0396\u039a parallel to \u039a\u03a8, and let this be \u039f\u0396. Now since \u0396\u03a9\u039f is equal to \u039a\u03a3\u03a8, and \u039a\u03a3 is imperceptibly greater than \u03a8\u03a3  or \u03a9\u039f (because \u039a\u03a8\u03a3 is right, and the angle at \u03a3 is not greater than 2\u00b0 3\u2019, so that if \u03a8\u03a3 is 100,000, \u039a\u03a3 is 100,064), \u039f\u0396 is also imperceptibly less than \u039a\u03a8. Let \u0396\u0394 be joined, and let a line be drawn at \u039f parallel to \u0396\u0394. Now the moment of time at which the center of the epicycle is placed at \u0396 by Ptolemy and at \u039f by me, is the same, and is designated by both of us by the line \u039a\u03a5 in the theory of the sun. In the theory of Mars, that moment should be designated in the former theory by \u0396\u0394, because \u0394 is the point of equality, while in the new theory it will be designated by a line parallel to \u0396\u0394. Therefore, there will be a new point of equality, about which the time is counted, on this parallel through \u039f. ","659":"Now Ptolemy measured out the courses of the planets, not on the lines \u039a\u03a3, but on the lines \u039a\u03a5 drawn from \u039a parallel to the lines \u03a8\u03a3 passing through the sun\u2019s body.

Again (as before) when the sun \u0393, the center of the sun\u2019s eccentric \u03a8, and the earth \u039a are on the same line, so that the line of the sun\u2019s apparent position \u03a8\u0393 and the line of its mean position \u039a\u0393 coincide, then for the center of the epicycle \u03a4 this place remains the same, whether its sidereal position is designated by \u039a\u03a4 or by \u03a8\u03a4, and the planet is really on the line \u039a\u03a4 or \u03a8\u03a4 and at the lowest point on its epicycle \u03a6, since here it is nearest to both \u03a8 and \u039a. The planet is thereby truly divested of its second inequality. But when the sun comes to the side of its eccentric (that is, to the middle distances), a great enough difference arises. For let the sun have gone from \u0393 to \u03a3, and the line of the sun\u2019s mean position \u039a\u03a5 be found in Aries, and the planet\u2019s line of vision \u039a\u03a9 precisely opposite in Libra, so that \u03a5\u039a\u03a9 is a single line. Now since  Ptolemy declared that the planet \u03a9 on this line of vision \u039a\u03a9 is divested of its second inequality, he places the center of the epicycle \u0396 on the line \u039a\u03a9. But since \u039a\u03a3 has gone beyond \u039a\u03a5, the sun\u2019s apparent position is beyond opposition to the planet. And in the last part of the time, \u039a\u03a9 is not descending, so as to be opposite \u039a\u03a3, but ascends towards \u039a\u03a6, because the lowest parts of the epicycle \u03a9 are retrograde and swifter than the center \u0396, and it is there, of course, that the planet is at opposition to the sun. Therefore, this apparent opposition precedes the mean one.\nTherefore, at some time preceding the moment designated by \u039a\u03a5 (let it be \u039a\u0398) when the sun is seen on the line \u039a\u039e, the planet will be seen opposite it (suppose it to be at \u0399) on \u039a\u0399 which forms a straight line with \u039a\u039e. Also, because it is now laid down that it sheds the second inequality at this true opposition, the center of the epicycle will also be seen on this line \u039e\u039a, say at \u039f. And because the planet is retrograde, at the time \u039a\u0398 prior to \u039a\u03a5 the planet is on the line \u039a\u0399 later than at \u039a\u03a9. But \u039a\u0399 and \u039a\u03a9 are parts of the lines \u039a\u039f and \u039a\u0396. Therefore, \u039a\u039f too is more to the east than \u039a\u0396.\nThus it is clear what would be changed on the line of the epicycle\u2019s center by this restoration from the sun\u2019s mean position to its apparent position. For at \u03a4 and the opposite point on the original line the motions of the epicycle\u2019s center remain unchanged. At \u0396 this line, and the center of the epicycle upon it, is moved forward and a subtraction is made from the intervening time. At the opposite place the contrary happens: an addition is made to the time, and the line of motion of the center of the epicycle is moved back westward. And thus these lines of the center of the epicycle differ much from the original lines. For this reason also, when we investigate the causes and measure of the first inequality by a new and repeated operation using these several observed positions of the center of the epicycle (that is, using the observed positions of the planet, after which we suppose the center of the epicycle to lie upon the same line), the outcome of this operation differs much from that of the preceding one. That is, since the time in the semicircle containing the apogee will have been diminished, so that the planet is correspondingly faster, the eccentricity of the equant will come out smaller.

Therefore, the perigee has come closer to the latter, and the apogee has descended from \u03a7 towards \u0396.\nThe quantification of the new hypothesis will be made clear thus. It is presupposed that the planet \u03a9 falls on the line drawn from the center of the epicycle \u0396 through the earth \u039a, only when \u039a\u0396 is collinear with \u039a\u03a3, the sun\u2019s apparent position. Therefore, \u039a\u03a3 and the line drawn from \u0396 through the body of the planet always proceed in parallel. Moreover, we have just taken it from Ptolemy that at the time when the line of the sun\u2019s mean position was \u039a\u03a5, drawn through \u03a9, the planet was observed on the line \u039a\u03a9, and nonetheless we do not grant him that the center of the epicycle \u0396 is on \u039a\u03a9 at the same time. Therefore, in accord with our position, let a line be drawn from the planet\u2019s position \u03a9 parallel to \u039a\u03a3, and let this be \u03a9\u039f. We are supposing that the center of the epicycle is at this moment on the line \u03a9\u039f, or some other line nearby and parallel, according as \u03a9 (representing the planet) is closer to or farther from \u039a on the line \u039a\u0396. Let \u03a9\u039f be drawn from whatever point on the line \u039a\u0396 (now, it is \u03a9), equal to \u03a9\u0396. From \u039f let a line be drawn to \u0396\u039a parallel to \u039a\u03a8, and let this be \u039f\u0396. Now since \u0396\u03a9\u039f is equal to \u039a\u03a3\u03a8, and \u039a\u03a3 is imperceptibly greater than \u03a8\u03a3  or \u03a9\u039f (because \u039a\u03a8\u03a3 is right, and the angle at \u03a3 is not greater than 2\u00b0 3\u2019, so that if \u03a8\u03a3 is 100,000, \u039a\u03a3 is 100,064), \u039f\u0396 is also imperceptibly less than \u039a\u03a8. Let \u0396\u0394 be joined, and let a line be drawn at \u039f parallel to \u0396\u0394. Now the moment of time at which the center of the epicycle is placed at \u0396 by Ptolemy and at \u039f by me, is the same, and is designated by both of us by the line \u039a\u03a5 in the theory of the sun. In the theory of Mars, that moment should be designated in the former theory by \u0396\u0394, because \u0394 is the point of equality, while in the new theory it will be designated by a line parallel to \u0396\u0394. Therefore, there will be a new point of equality, about which the time is counted, on this parallel through \u039f. ","660":"Now Ptolemy measured out the courses of the planets, not on the lines \u039a\u03a3, but on the lines \u039a\u03a5 drawn from \u039a parallel to the lines \u03a8\u03a3 passing through the sun\u2019s body. For whenever the planet fell upon these lines \u039a\u03a5 on the side opposite the sun, it was supposed to have shed its second inequality, which fell to it (in Ptolemy\u2019s opinion) because of the epicycle. Then the planet\u2019s sidereal position was sought out by means of instruments, and the center of the epicycle was supposed to be found at that time on the same line. This was done a number of times and at various places on the zodiac: say, \u039a\u0393, \u039a\u03a5, and the points opposite. From three such positions of the planet (or of the center of the epicycle, which, according to Ptolemy, accounts for the second inequality), the practitioner sets out to investigate the hypothesis for the first inequality by comparing these angles which the observed positions form about \u039a, the center of the earth and of observation, with the intervening times. The method for this enterprise is found in Ptolemy Book IX ^19. Now suppose the treatment done, and let the eccentric's line of apsides come out to be \u039a\u039b\u0394\u03a7, with \u0394 the equalizing point, the center of the eccentric upon this line and at point \u039b, and the eccentric \u03a7\u0396. And let this hypothesis correspond to all positions observed at the times of the planet\u2019s opposition to the sun\u2019s mean position.\nHere, the objections I raised against Copernicus concerning the ordering of the physical motion are also not clearly in agreement with Ptolemy. For the center of the epicycle which accounts for the second inequality, here just as the planet itself previously, is borne slowly or swiftly according to its approach  to or recession from the earth \u039a, performed on the circle \u03a7\u0396. Furthermore, to stipulate that there is in the earth \u039a (just as there was before in Copernicus\u2019s sun, the heart of the world) a motive force that drives the centers of this kind of epicycle around, is absurd and monstrous. The hypothesis can also be discredited by another physical argument. For intrinsic to this form of hypothesis, in one way or another, is solidity of the orbs; and since this has been destroyed (by Tycho Brahe\u2019s observations of comets), the hypothesis appears, so to speak, to collapse under its own weight. For a moving force would be declared to reside in the center of the epicycle (not in a body, but in a mathematical point), and to rouse itself to move from place to place, by an unequal amount in equal times; but at the same time would draw the planet along with itself at the distance of the epicycle\u2019s diameter; all the while causing the planet to gyrate around itself, by equal amounts in equal times. That this enormous variety cannot fall to a single moving mind (unless it be God), Aristotle gives supporting arguments in the Metaphysics Book XII Ch. 8: he holds that the individual minds preside over individual, perfectly uniform and simple circular motions. Besides, how will some power sit in a non-body, and flow out of the non-body into the planet? Even if you divide up the tasks, and locate one motive intelligence at the center of the epicycle and another in the body of the planet, the one at the center will use the earth (a body, of course) as its reference, and will move around the earth nonuniformly in a circle, while the one at a point on the circumference (that is, in the planet's body) will move around an incorporeal center and do so uniformly. The question, then, is (as before), by what aids would it move around the incorporeal point? Not by geometrical imagination, for it does not admit of geometrical imagination of itself. Nor can a mobile point subsist in a non-body even in imagination. We humans, in imagining points of this sort, have recourse to the aids of tablets or paper, which we draw upon with our hands or at least remember ourselves to have drawn once. But it likewise cannot happen through a physical flowing of power (which is in the center of the epicycle) out to the circumference and the planet\u2019s body. For we have submitted to this outflow of power on the supposition that the tasks of the compound motions are divided between two minds. Why not also question whether in the first, eccentric motion, some natural force constituted to produce motion might subsist in some point entirely devoid of any body? And even more, whether this kind of incorporeal power can move itself around the earth, and go from place to place? And most of all, whether it can communicate or transfer another's motion through an efflux from itself, although it is not supported by any body that could serve as its nest? Those sublime considerations of the essence, motion, place, and operations of the blessed angels and of separate minds which some people will want to raise in opposition to me, are irrelevant. For we are arguing about natural things which are far inferior in dignity, about powers that exercise no choice of how to vary their action, and about minds which are not in the least separate, since they are yoked and bound to the celestial bodies which they are to bear. These, then, are the general objections that can be raised against  Ptolemy. \nBut something further may be said to Ptolemy, on account of which in particular he would wish to abandon his mean position of the sun and embrace the apparent with us. For if the power moving the planet (whether single or double) acts with respect to the sun, so that it places the planet at the lowest point of the epicycle whenever the center of the epicycle is opposite the sun, I ask (as above) why it looks to the imaginary point \u03a5 (which sometimes precedes and sometimes follows the sun, here marked \u03a3, and is sometimes above and sometimes below it), rather than the sun's body itself? Or how it is that that power can have any perception whatever of the motion of \u03a5 around the earth K, since there is no body at \u03a8? Is it not more probable that the epicycle is restored to the lines \u039a\u03a3 of the sun\u2019s apparent position, when these pass through the center of the epicycle?\n Let us then see what is changed on the eccentric by substitution of the sun\u2019s apparent position. Again (as before) when the sun \u0393, the center of the sun\u2019s eccentric \u03a8, and the earth \u039a are on the same line, so that the line of the sun\u2019s apparent position \u03a8\u0393 and the line of its mean position \u039a\u0393 coincide, then for the center of the epicycle \u03a4 this place remains the same, whether its sidereal position is designated by \u039a\u03a4 or by \u03a8\u03a4, and the planet is really on the line \u039a\u03a4 or \u03a8\u03a4 and at the lowest point on its epicycle \u03a6, since here it is nearest to both \u03a8 and \u039a. The planet is thereby truly divested of its second inequality. But when the sun comes to the side of its eccentric (that is, to the middle distances), a great enough difference arises. For let the sun have gone from \u0393 to \u03a3, and the line of the sun\u2019s mean position \u039a\u03a5 be found in Aries, and the planet\u2019s line of vision \u039a\u03a9 precisely opposite in Libra, so that \u03a5\u039a\u03a9 is a single line. Now since  Ptolemy declared that the planet \u03a9 on this line of vision \u039a\u03a9 is divested of its second inequality, he places the center of the epicycle \u0396 on the line \u039a\u03a9. But since \u039a\u03a3 has gone beyond \u039a\u03a5, the sun\u2019s apparent position is beyond opposition to the planet. And in the last part of the time, \u039a\u03a9 is not descending, so as to be opposite \u039a\u03a3, but ascends towards \u039a\u03a6, because the lowest parts of the epicycle \u03a9 are retrograde and swifter than the center \u0396, and it is there, of course, that the planet is at opposition to the sun. Therefore, this apparent opposition precedes the mean one.\nTherefore, at some time preceding the moment designated by \u039a\u03a5 (let it be \u039a\u0398) when the sun is seen on the line \u039a\u039e, the planet will be seen opposite it (suppose it to be at \u0399) on \u039a\u0399 which forms a straight line with \u039a\u039e. Also, because it is now laid down that it sheds the second inequality at this true opposition, the center of the epicycle will also be seen on this line \u039e\u039a, say at \u039f. And because the planet is retrograde, at the time \u039a\u0398 prior to \u039a\u03a5 the planet is on the line \u039a\u0399 later than at \u039a\u03a9. But \u039a\u0399 and \u039a\u03a9 are parts of the lines \u039a\u039f and \u039a\u0396. Therefore, \u039a\u039f too is more to the east than \u039a\u0396.\nThus it is clear what would be changed on the line of the epicycle\u2019s center by this restoration from the sun\u2019s mean position to its apparent position. For at \u03a4 and the opposite point on the original line the motions of the epicycle\u2019s center remain unchanged. At \u0396 this line, and the center of the epicycle upon it, is moved forward and a subtraction is made from the intervening time. At the opposite place the contrary happens: an addition is made to the time, and the line of motion of the center of the epicycle is moved back westward. And thus these lines of the center of the epicycle differ much from the original lines. For this reason also, when we investigate the causes and measure of the first inequality by a new and repeated operation using these several observed positions of the center of the epicycle (that is, using the observed positions of the planet, after which we suppose the center of the epicycle to lie upon the same line), the outcome of this operation differs much from that of the preceding one. That is, since the time in the semicircle containing the apogee will have been diminished, so that the planet is correspondingly faster, the eccentricity of the equant will come out smaller. And since in the greater quadrant \u0392\u0396 of the semicircle containing the apogee the time will have been diminished by an amount equal to the diminution in the other, smaller part, the planet has been made proportionally much faster in the remaining part of the semicircle. Therefore, the perigee has come closer to the latter, and the apogee has descended from \u03a7 towards \u0396.\nThe quantification of the new hypothesis will be made clear thus. It is presupposed that the planet \u03a9 falls on the line drawn from the center of the epicycle \u0396 through the earth \u039a, only when \u039a\u0396 is collinear with \u039a\u03a3, the sun\u2019s apparent position. Therefore, \u039a\u03a3 and the line drawn from \u0396 through the body of the planet always proceed in parallel. Moreover, we have just taken it from Ptolemy that at the time when the line of the sun\u2019s mean position was \u039a\u03a5, drawn through \u03a9, the planet was observed on the line \u039a\u03a9, and nonetheless we do not grant him that the center of the epicycle \u0396 is on \u039a\u03a9 at the same time. Therefore, in accord with our position, let a line be drawn from the planet\u2019s position \u03a9 parallel to \u039a\u03a3, and let this be \u03a9\u039f. We are supposing that the center of the epicycle is at this moment on the line \u03a9\u039f, or some other line nearby and parallel, according as \u03a9 (representing the planet) is closer to or farther from \u039a on the line \u039a\u0396. Let \u03a9\u039f be drawn from whatever point on the line \u039a\u0396 (now, it is \u03a9), equal to \u03a9\u0396. From \u039f let a line be drawn to \u0396\u039a parallel to \u039a\u03a8, and let this be \u039f\u0396. Now since \u0396\u03a9\u039f is equal to \u039a\u03a3\u03a8, and \u039a\u03a3 is imperceptibly greater than \u03a8\u03a3  or \u03a9\u039f (because \u039a\u03a8\u03a3 is right, and the angle at \u03a3 is not greater than 2\u00b0 3\u2019, so that if \u03a8\u03a3 is 100,000, \u039a\u03a3 is 100,064), \u039f\u0396 is also imperceptibly less than \u039a\u03a8. Let \u0396\u0394 be joined, and let a line be drawn at \u039f parallel to \u0396\u0394. Now the moment of time at which the center of the epicycle is placed at \u0396 by Ptolemy and at \u039f by me, is the same, and is designated by both of us by the line \u039a\u03a5 in the theory of the sun. In the theory of Mars, that moment should be designated in the former theory by \u0396\u0394, because \u0394 is the point of equality, while in the new theory it will be designated by a line parallel to \u0396\u0394. Therefore, there will be a new point of equality, about which the time is counted, on this parallel through \u039f. ","661":"Now Ptolemy measured out the courses of the planets, not on the lines \u039a\u03a3, but on the lines \u039a\u03a5 drawn from \u039a parallel to the lines \u03a8\u03a3 passing through the sun\u2019s body.

Again (as before) when the sun \u0393, the center of the sun\u2019s eccentric \u03a8, and the earth \u039a are on the same line, so that the line of the sun\u2019s apparent position \u03a8\u0393 and the line of its mean position \u039a\u0393 coincide, then for the center of the epicycle \u03a4 this place remains the same, whether its sidereal position is designated by \u039a\u03a4 or by \u03a8\u03a4, and the planet is really on the line \u039a\u03a4 or \u03a8\u03a4 and at the lowest point on its epicycle \u03a6, since here it is nearest to both \u03a8 and \u039a. The planet is thereby truly divested of its second inequality. But when the sun comes to the side of its eccentric (that is, to the middle distances), a great enough difference arises. For let the sun have gone from \u0393 to \u03a3, and the line of the sun\u2019s mean position \u039a\u03a5 be found in Aries, and the planet\u2019s line of vision \u039a\u03a9 precisely opposite in Libra, so that \u03a5\u039a\u03a9 is a single line. Now since  Ptolemy declared that the planet \u03a9 on this line of vision \u039a\u03a9 is divested of its second inequality, he places the center of the epicycle \u0396 on the line \u039a\u03a9. But since \u039a\u03a3 has gone beyond \u039a\u03a5, the sun\u2019s apparent position is beyond opposition to the planet. And in the last part of the time, \u039a\u03a9 is not descending, so as to be opposite \u039a\u03a3, but ascends towards \u039a\u03a6, because the lowest parts of the epicycle \u03a9 are retrograde and swifter than the center \u0396, and it is there, of course, that the planet is at opposition to the sun. Therefore, this apparent opposition precedes the mean one.\nTherefore, at some time preceding the moment designated by \u039a\u03a5 (let it be \u039a\u0398) when the sun is seen on the line \u039a\u039e, the planet will be seen opposite it (suppose it to be at \u0399) on \u039a\u0399 which forms a straight line with \u039a\u039e. Also, because it is now laid down that it sheds the second inequality at this true opposition, the center of the epicycle will also be seen on this line \u039e\u039a, say at \u039f. And because the planet is retrograde, at the time \u039a\u0398 prior to \u039a\u03a5 the planet is on the line \u039a\u0399 later than at \u039a\u03a9. But \u039a\u0399 and \u039a\u03a9 are parts of the lines \u039a\u039f and \u039a\u0396. Therefore, \u039a\u039f too is more to the east than \u039a\u0396.\nThus it is clear what would be changed on the line of the epicycle\u2019s center by this restoration from the sun\u2019s mean position to its apparent position. For at \u03a4 and the opposite point on the original line the motions of the epicycle\u2019s center remain unchanged. At \u0396 this line, and the center of the epicycle upon it, is moved forward and a subtraction is made from the intervening time. At the opposite place the contrary happens: an addition is made to the time, and the line of motion of the center of the epicycle is moved back westward. And thus these lines of the center of the epicycle differ much from the original lines.

That is, since the time in the semicircle containing the apogee will have been diminished, so that the planet is correspondingly faster, the eccentricity of the equant will come out smaller. And since in the greater quadrant \u0392\u0396 of the semicircle containing the apogee the time will have been diminished by an amount equal to the diminution in the other, smaller part, the planet has been made proportionally much faster in the remaining part of the semicircle. Therefore, the perigee has come closer to the latter, and the apogee has descended from \u03a7 towards \u0396.\nThe quantification of the new hypothesis will be made clear thus. It is presupposed that the planet \u03a9 falls on the line drawn from the center of the epicycle \u0396 through the earth \u039a, only when \u039a\u0396 is collinear with \u039a\u03a3, the sun\u2019s apparent position. Therefore, \u039a\u03a3 and the line drawn from \u0396 through the body of the planet always proceed in parallel. Moreover, we have just taken it from Ptolemy that at the time when the line of the sun\u2019s mean position was \u039a\u03a5, drawn through \u03a9, the planet was observed on the line \u039a\u03a9, and nonetheless we do not grant him that the center of the epicycle \u0396 is on \u039a\u03a9 at the same time. Therefore, in accord with our position, let a line be drawn from the planet\u2019s position \u03a9 parallel to \u039a\u03a3, and let this be \u03a9\u039f. We are supposing that the center of the epicycle is at this moment on the line \u03a9\u039f, or some other line nearby and parallel, according as \u03a9 (representing the planet) is closer to or farther from \u039a on the line \u039a\u0396. Let \u03a9\u039f be drawn from whatever point on the line \u039a\u0396 (now, it is \u03a9), equal to \u03a9\u0396. From \u039f let a line be drawn to \u0396\u039a parallel to \u039a\u03a8, and let this be \u039f\u0396. Now since \u0396\u03a9\u039f is equal to \u039a\u03a3\u03a8, and \u039a\u03a3 is imperceptibly greater than \u03a8\u03a3  or \u03a9\u039f (because \u039a\u03a8\u03a3 is right, and the angle at \u03a3 is not greater than 2\u00b0 3\u2019, so that if \u03a8\u03a3 is 100,000, \u039a\u03a3 is 100,064), \u039f\u0396 is also imperceptibly less than \u039a\u03a8. Let \u0396\u0394 be joined, and let a line be drawn at \u039f parallel to \u0396\u0394. Now the moment of time at which the center of the epicycle is placed at \u0396 by Ptolemy and at \u039f by me, is the same, and is designated by both of us by the line \u039a\u03a5 in the theory of the sun. In the theory of Mars, that moment should be designated in the former theory by \u0396\u0394, because \u0394 is the point of equality, while in the new theory it will be designated by a line parallel to \u0396\u0394. Therefore, there will be a new point of equality, about which the time is counted, on this parallel through \u039f. ","662":"Now Ptolemy measured out the courses of the planets, not on the lines \u039a\u03a3, but on the lines \u039a\u03a5 drawn from \u039a parallel to the lines \u03a8\u03a3 passing through the sun\u2019s body. For whenever the planet fell upon these lines \u039a\u03a5 on the side opposite the sun, it was supposed to have shed its second inequality, which fell to it (in Ptolemy\u2019s opinion) because of the epicycle. Then the planet\u2019s sidereal position was sought out by means of instruments, and the center of the epicycle was supposed to be found at that time on the same line. This was done a number of times and at various places on the zodiac: say, \u039a\u0393, \u039a\u03a5, and the points opposite. From three such positions of the planet (or of the center of the epicycle, which, according to Ptolemy, accounts for the second inequality), the practitioner sets out to investigate the hypothesis for the first inequality by comparing these angles which the observed positions form about \u039a, the center of the earth and of observation, with the intervening times. The method for this enterprise is found in Ptolemy Book IX ^19. Now suppose the treatment done, and let the eccentric's line of apsides come out to be \u039a\u039b\u0394\u03a7, with \u0394 the equalizing point, the center of the eccentric upon this line and at point \u039b, and the eccentric \u03a7\u0396. And let this hypothesis correspond to all positions observed at the times of the planet\u2019s opposition to the sun\u2019s mean position.\nHere, the objections I raised against Copernicus concerning the ordering of the physical motion are also not clearly in agreement with Ptolemy. For the center of the epicycle which accounts for the second inequality, here just as the planet itself previously, is borne slowly or swiftly according to its approach  to or recession from the earth \u039a, performed on the circle \u03a7\u0396. Furthermore, to stipulate that there is in the earth \u039a (just as there was before in Copernicus\u2019s sun, the heart of the world) a motive force that drives the centers of this kind of epicycle around, is absurd and monstrous. The hypothesis can also be discredited by another physical argument. For intrinsic to this form of hypothesis, in one way or another, is solidity of the orbs; and since this has been destroyed (by Tycho Brahe\u2019s observations of comets), the hypothesis appears, so to speak, to collapse under its own weight. For a moving force would be declared to reside in the center of the epicycle (not in a body, but in a mathematical point), and to rouse itself to move from place to place, by an unequal amount in equal times; but at the same time would draw the planet along with itself at the distance of the epicycle\u2019s diameter; all the while causing the planet to gyrate around itself, by equal amounts in equal times. That this enormous variety cannot fall to a single moving mind (unless it be God), Aristotle gives supporting arguments in the Metaphysics Book XII Ch. 8: he holds that the individual minds preside over individual, perfectly uniform and simple circular motions. Besides, how will some power sit in a non-body, and flow out of the non-body into the planet? Even if you divide up the tasks, and locate one motive intelligence at the center of the epicycle and another in the body of the planet, the one at the center will use the earth (a body, of course) as its reference, and will move around the earth nonuniformly in a circle, while the one at a point on the circumference (that is, in the planet's body) will move around an incorporeal center and do so uniformly. The question, then, is (as before), by what aids would it move around the incorporeal point? Not by geometrical imagination, for it does not admit of geometrical imagination of itself. Nor can a mobile point subsist in a non-body even in imagination. We humans, in imagining points of this sort, have recourse to the aids of tablets or paper, which we draw upon with our hands or at least remember ourselves to have drawn once. But it likewise cannot happen through a physical flowing of power (which is in the center of the epicycle) out to the circumference and the planet\u2019s body. For we have submitted to this outflow of power on the supposition that the tasks of the compound motions are divided between two minds. Why not also question whether in the first, eccentric motion, some natural force constituted to produce motion might subsist in some point entirely devoid of any body? And even more, whether this kind of incorporeal power can move itself around the earth, and go from place to place? And most of all, whether it can communicate or transfer another's motion through an efflux from itself, although it is not supported by any body that could serve as its nest? Those sublime considerations of the essence, motion, place, and operations of the blessed angels and of separate minds which some people will want to raise in opposition to me, are irrelevant. For we are arguing about natural things which are far inferior in dignity, about powers that exercise no choice of how to vary their action, and about minds which are not in the least separate, since they are yoked and bound to the celestial bodies which they are to bear. These, then, are the general objections that can be raised against  Ptolemy. \nBut something further may be said to Ptolemy, on account of which in particular he would wish to abandon his mean position of the sun and embrace the apparent with us. For if the power moving the planet (whether single or double) acts with respect to the sun, so that it places the planet at the lowest point of the epicycle whenever the center of the epicycle is opposite the sun, I ask (as above) why it looks to the imaginary point \u03a5 (which sometimes precedes and sometimes follows the sun, here marked \u03a3, and is sometimes above and sometimes below it), rather than the sun's body itself? Or how it is that that power can have any perception whatever of the motion of \u03a5 around the earth K, since there is no body at \u03a8? Is it not more probable that the epicycle is restored to the lines \u039a\u03a3 of the sun\u2019s apparent position, when these pass through the center of the epicycle?\n Let us then see what is changed on the eccentric by substitution of the sun\u2019s apparent position. Again (as before) when the sun \u0393, the center of the sun\u2019s eccentric \u03a8, and the earth \u039a are on the same line, so that the line of the sun\u2019s apparent position \u03a8\u0393 and the line of its mean position \u039a\u0393 coincide, then for the center of the epicycle \u03a4 this place remains the same, whether its sidereal position is designated by \u039a\u03a4 or by \u03a8\u03a4, and the planet is really on the line \u039a\u03a4 or \u03a8\u03a4 and at the lowest point on its epicycle \u03a6, since here it is nearest to both \u03a8 and \u039a. The planet is thereby truly divested of its second inequality. But when the sun comes to the side of its eccentric (that is, to the middle distances), a great enough difference arises. For let the sun have gone from \u0393 to \u03a3, and the line of the sun\u2019s mean position \u039a\u03a5 be found in Aries, and the planet\u2019s line of vision \u039a\u03a9 precisely opposite in Libra, so that \u03a5\u039a\u03a9 is a single line. Now since  Ptolemy declared that the planet \u03a9 on this line of vision \u039a\u03a9 is divested of its second inequality, he places the center of the epicycle \u0396 on the line \u039a\u03a9. But since \u039a\u03a3 has gone beyond \u039a\u03a5, the sun\u2019s apparent position is beyond opposition to the planet. And in the last part of the time, \u039a\u03a9 is not descending, so as to be opposite \u039a\u03a3, but ascends towards \u039a\u03a6, because the lowest parts of the epicycle \u03a9 are retrograde and swifter than the center \u0396, and it is there, of course, that the planet is at opposition to the sun. Therefore, this apparent opposition precedes the mean one.\nTherefore, at some time preceding the moment designated by \u039a\u03a5 (let it be \u039a\u0398) when the sun is seen on the line \u039a\u039e, the planet will be seen opposite it (suppose it to be at \u0399) on \u039a\u0399 which forms a straight line with \u039a\u039e. Also, because it is now laid down that it sheds the second inequality at this true opposition, the center of the epicycle will also be seen on this line \u039e\u039a, say at \u039f. And because the planet is retrograde, at the time \u039a\u0398 prior to \u039a\u03a5 the planet is on the line \u039a\u0399 later than at \u039a\u03a9. But \u039a\u0399 and \u039a\u03a9 are parts of the lines \u039a\u039f and \u039a\u0396. Therefore, \u039a\u039f too is more to the east than \u039a\u0396.\nThus it is clear what would be changed on the line of the epicycle\u2019s center by this restoration from the sun\u2019s mean position to its apparent position. For at \u03a4 and the opposite point on the original line the motions of the epicycle\u2019s center remain unchanged. At \u0396 this line, and the center of the epicycle upon it, is moved forward and a subtraction is made from the intervening time. At the opposite place the contrary happens: an addition is made to the time, and the line of motion of the center of the epicycle is moved back westward. And thus these lines of the center of the epicycle differ much from the original lines. For this reason also, when we investigate the causes and measure of the first inequality by a new and repeated operation using these several observed positions of the center of the epicycle (that is, using the observed positions of the planet, after which we suppose the center of the epicycle to lie upon the same line), the outcome of this operation differs much from that of the preceding one. That is, since the time in the semicircle containing the apogee will have been diminished, so that the planet is correspondingly faster, the eccentricity of the equant will come out smaller. And since in the greater quadrant \u0392\u0396 of the semicircle containing the apogee the time will have been diminished by an amount equal to the diminution in the other, smaller part, the planet has been made proportionally much faster in the remaining part of the semicircle. Therefore, the perigee has come closer to the latter, and the apogee has descended from \u03a7 towards \u0396.\nThe quantification of the new hypothesis will be made clear thus. It is presupposed that the planet \u03a9 falls on the line drawn from the center of the epicycle \u0396 through the earth \u039a, only when \u039a\u0396 is collinear with \u039a\u03a3, the sun\u2019s apparent position. Therefore, \u039a\u03a3 and the line drawn from \u0396 through the body of the planet always proceed in parallel. Moreover, we have just taken it from Ptolemy that at the time when the line of the sun\u2019s mean position was \u039a\u03a5, drawn through \u03a9, the planet was observed on the line \u039a\u03a9, and nonetheless we do not grant him that the center of the epicycle \u0396 is on \u039a\u03a9 at the same time. Therefore, in accord with our position, let a line be drawn from the planet\u2019s position \u03a9 parallel to \u039a\u03a3, and let this be \u03a9\u039f. We are supposing that the center of the epicycle is at this moment on the line \u03a9\u039f, or some other line nearby and parallel, according as \u03a9 (representing the planet) is closer to or farther from \u039a on the line \u039a\u0396. Let \u03a9\u039f be drawn from whatever point on the line \u039a\u0396 (now, it is \u03a9), equal to \u03a9\u0396. From \u039f let a line be drawn to \u0396\u039a parallel to \u039a\u03a8, and let this be \u039f\u0396. Now since \u0396\u03a9\u039f is equal to \u039a\u03a3\u03a8, and \u039a\u03a3 is imperceptibly greater than \u03a8\u03a3  or \u03a9\u039f (because \u039a\u03a8\u03a3 is right, and the angle at \u03a3 is not greater than 2\u00b0 3\u2019, so that if \u03a8\u03a3 is 100,000, \u039a\u03a3 is 100,064), \u039f\u0396 is also imperceptibly less than \u039a\u03a8. Let \u0396\u0394 be joined, and let a line be drawn at \u039f parallel to \u0396\u0394. Now the moment of time at which the center of the epicycle is placed at \u0396 by Ptolemy and at \u039f by me, is the same, and is designated by both of us by the line \u039a\u03a5 in the theory of the sun. In the theory of Mars, that moment should be designated in the former theory by \u0396\u0394, because \u0394 is the point of equality, while in the new theory it will be designated by a line parallel to \u0396\u0394. Therefore, there will be a new point of equality, about which the time is counted, on this parallel through \u039f. ","663":"Now Ptolemy measured out the courses of the planets, not on the lines \u039a\u03a3, but on the lines \u039a\u03a5 drawn from \u039a parallel to the lines \u03a8\u03a3 passing through the sun\u2019s body.

The planet is thereby truly divested of its second inequality. But when the sun comes to the side of its eccentric (that is, to the middle distances), a great enough difference arises. For let the sun have gone from \u0393 to \u03a3, and the line of the sun\u2019s mean position \u039a\u03a5 be found in Aries, and the planet\u2019s line of vision \u039a\u03a9 precisely opposite in Libra, so that \u03a5\u039a\u03a9 is a single line. Now since  Ptolemy declared that the planet \u03a9 on this line of vision \u039a\u03a9 is divested of its second inequality, he places the center of the epicycle \u0396 on the line \u039a\u03a9. But since \u039a\u03a3 has gone beyond \u039a\u03a5, the sun\u2019s apparent position is beyond opposition to the planet. And in the last part of the time, \u039a\u03a9 is not descending, so as to be opposite \u039a\u03a3, but ascends towards \u039a\u03a6, because the lowest parts of the epicycle \u03a9 are retrograde and swifter than the center \u0396, and it is there, of course, that the planet is at opposition to the sun. Therefore, this apparent opposition precedes the mean one.\nTherefore, at some time preceding the moment designated by \u039a\u03a5 (let it be \u039a\u0398) when the sun is seen on the line \u039a\u039e, the planet will be seen opposite it (suppose it to be at \u0399) on \u039a\u0399 which forms a straight line with \u039a\u039e. Also, because it is now laid down that it sheds the second inequality at this true opposition, the center of the epicycle will also be seen on this line \u039e\u039a, say at \u039f. And because the planet is retrograde, at the time \u039a\u0398 prior to \u039a\u03a5 the planet is on the line \u039a\u0399 later than at \u039a\u03a9. But \u039a\u0399 and \u039a\u03a9 are parts of the lines \u039a\u039f and \u039a\u0396. Therefore, \u039a\u039f too is more to the east than \u039a\u0396.\nThus it is clear what would be changed on the line of the epicycle\u2019s center by this restoration from the sun\u2019s mean position to its apparent position. For at \u03a4 and the opposite point on the original line the motions of the epicycle\u2019s center remain unchanged. At \u0396 this line, and the center of the epicycle upon it, is moved forward and a subtraction is made from the intervening time. At the opposite place the contrary happens: an addition is made to the time, and the line of motion of the center of the epicycle is moved back westward.

Therefore, the perigee has come closer to the latter, and the apogee has descended from \u03a7 towards \u0396.\nThe quantification of the new hypothesis will be made clear thus. It is presupposed that the planet \u03a9 falls on the line drawn from the center of the epicycle \u0396 through the earth \u039a, only when \u039a\u0396 is collinear with \u039a\u03a3, the sun\u2019s apparent position. Therefore, \u039a\u03a3 and the line drawn from \u0396 through the body of the planet always proceed in parallel. Moreover, we have just taken it from Ptolemy that at the time when the line of the sun\u2019s mean position was \u039a\u03a5, drawn through \u03a9, the planet was observed on the line \u039a\u03a9, and nonetheless we do not grant him that the center of the epicycle \u0396 is on \u039a\u03a9 at the same time. Therefore, in accord with our position, let a line be drawn from the planet\u2019s position \u03a9 parallel to \u039a\u03a3, and let this be \u03a9\u039f. We are supposing that the center of the epicycle is at this moment on the line \u03a9\u039f, or some other line nearby and parallel, according as \u03a9 (representing the planet) is closer to or farther from \u039a on the line \u039a\u0396. Let \u03a9\u039f be drawn from whatever point on the line \u039a\u0396 (now, it is \u03a9), equal to \u03a9\u0396. From \u039f let a line be drawn to \u0396\u039a parallel to \u039a\u03a8, and let this be \u039f\u0396. Now since \u0396\u03a9\u039f is equal to \u039a\u03a3\u03a8, and \u039a\u03a3 is imperceptibly greater than \u03a8\u03a3  or \u03a9\u039f (because \u039a\u03a8\u03a3 is right, and the angle at \u03a3 is not greater than 2\u00b0 3\u2019, so that if \u03a8\u03a3 is 100,000, \u039a\u03a3 is 100,064), \u039f\u0396 is also imperceptibly less than \u039a\u03a8. Let \u0396\u0394 be joined, and let a line be drawn at \u039f parallel to \u0396\u0394. Now the moment of time at which the center of the epicycle is placed at \u0396 by Ptolemy and at \u039f by me, is the same, and is designated by both of us by the line \u039a\u03a5 in the theory of the sun. In the theory of Mars, that moment should be designated in the former theory by \u0396\u0394, because \u0394 is the point of equality, while in the new theory it will be designated by a line parallel to \u0396\u0394. Therefore, there will be a new point of equality, about which the time is counted, on this parallel through \u039f. ","664":"Now Ptolemy measured out the courses of the planets, not on the lines \u039a\u03a3, but on the lines \u039a\u03a5 drawn from \u039a parallel to the lines \u03a8\u03a3 passing through the sun\u2019s body. For whenever the planet fell upon these lines \u039a\u03a5 on the side opposite the sun, it was supposed to have shed its second inequality, which fell to it (in Ptolemy\u2019s opinion) because of the epicycle. Then the planet\u2019s sidereal position was sought out by means of instruments, and the center of the epicycle was supposed to be found at that time on the same line. This was done a number of times and at various places on the zodiac: say, \u039a\u0393, \u039a\u03a5, and the points opposite. From three such positions of the planet (or of the center of the epicycle, which, according to Ptolemy, accounts for the second inequality), the practitioner sets out to investigate the hypothesis for the first inequality by comparing these angles which the observed positions form about \u039a, the center of the earth and of observation, with the intervening times. The method for this enterprise is found in Ptolemy Book IX ^19. Now suppose the treatment done, and let the eccentric's line of apsides come out to be \u039a\u039b\u0394\u03a7, with \u0394 the equalizing point, the center of the eccentric upon this line and at point \u039b, and the eccentric \u03a7\u0396. And let this hypothesis correspond to all positions observed at the times of the planet\u2019s opposition to the sun\u2019s mean position.\nHere, the objections I raised against Copernicus concerning the ordering of the physical motion are also not clearly in agreement with Ptolemy. For the center of the epicycle which accounts for the second inequality, here just as the planet itself previously, is borne slowly or swiftly according to its approach  to or recession from the earth \u039a, performed on the circle \u03a7\u0396. Furthermore, to stipulate that there is in the earth \u039a (just as there was before in Copernicus\u2019s sun, the heart of the world) a motive force that drives the centers of this kind of epicycle around, is absurd and monstrous. The hypothesis can also be discredited by another physical argument. For intrinsic to this form of hypothesis, in one way or another, is solidity of the orbs; and since this has been destroyed (by Tycho Brahe\u2019s observations of comets), the hypothesis appears, so to speak, to collapse under its own weight. For a moving force would be declared to reside in the center of the epicycle (not in a body, but in a mathematical point), and to rouse itself to move from place to place, by an unequal amount in equal times; but at the same time would draw the planet along with itself at the distance of the epicycle\u2019s diameter; all the while causing the planet to gyrate around itself, by equal amounts in equal times. That this enormous variety cannot fall to a single moving mind (unless it be God), Aristotle gives supporting arguments in the Metaphysics Book XII Ch. 8: he holds that the individual minds preside over individual, perfectly uniform and simple circular motions. Besides, how will some power sit in a non-body, and flow out of the non-body into the planet? Even if you divide up the tasks, and locate one motive intelligence at the center of the epicycle and another in the body of the planet, the one at the center will use the earth (a body, of course) as its reference, and will move around the earth nonuniformly in a circle, while the one at a point on the circumference (that is, in the planet's body) will move around an incorporeal center and do so uniformly. The question, then, is (as before), by what aids would it move around the incorporeal point? Not by geometrical imagination, for it does not admit of geometrical imagination of itself. Nor can a mobile point subsist in a non-body even in imagination. We humans, in imagining points of this sort, have recourse to the aids of tablets or paper, which we draw upon with our hands or at least remember ourselves to have drawn once. But it likewise cannot happen through a physical flowing of power (which is in the center of the epicycle) out to the circumference and the planet\u2019s body. For we have submitted to this outflow of power on the supposition that the tasks of the compound motions are divided between two minds. Why not also question whether in the first, eccentric motion, some natural force constituted to produce motion might subsist in some point entirely devoid of any body? And even more, whether this kind of incorporeal power can move itself around the earth, and go from place to place? And most of all, whether it can communicate or transfer another's motion through an efflux from itself, although it is not supported by any body that could serve as its nest? Those sublime considerations of the essence, motion, place, and operations of the blessed angels and of separate minds which some people will want to raise in opposition to me, are irrelevant. For we are arguing about natural things which are far inferior in dignity, about powers that exercise no choice of how to vary their action, and about minds which are not in the least separate, since they are yoked and bound to the celestial bodies which they are to bear. These, then, are the general objections that can be raised against  Ptolemy. \nBut something further may be said to Ptolemy, on account of which in particular he would wish to abandon his mean position of the sun and embrace the apparent with us. For if the power moving the planet (whether single or double) acts with respect to the sun, so that it places the planet at the lowest point of the epicycle whenever the center of the epicycle is opposite the sun, I ask (as above) why it looks to the imaginary point \u03a5 (which sometimes precedes and sometimes follows the sun, here marked \u03a3, and is sometimes above and sometimes below it), rather than the sun's body itself? Or how it is that that power can have any perception whatever of the motion of \u03a5 around the earth K, since there is no body at \u03a8? Is it not more probable that the epicycle is restored to the lines \u039a\u03a3 of the sun\u2019s apparent position, when these pass through the center of the epicycle?\n Let us then see what is changed on the eccentric by substitution of the sun\u2019s apparent position. Again (as before) when the sun \u0393, the center of the sun\u2019s eccentric \u03a8, and the earth \u039a are on the same line, so that the line of the sun\u2019s apparent position \u03a8\u0393 and the line of its mean position \u039a\u0393 coincide, then for the center of the epicycle \u03a4 this place remains the same, whether its sidereal position is designated by \u039a\u03a4 or by \u03a8\u03a4, and the planet is really on the line \u039a\u03a4 or \u03a8\u03a4 and at the lowest point on its epicycle \u03a6, since here it is nearest to both \u03a8 and \u039a. The planet is thereby truly divested of its second inequality. But when the sun comes to the side of its eccentric (that is, to the middle distances), a great enough difference arises. For let the sun have gone from \u0393 to \u03a3, and the line of the sun\u2019s mean position \u039a\u03a5 be found in Aries, and the planet\u2019s line of vision \u039a\u03a9 precisely opposite in Libra, so that \u03a5\u039a\u03a9 is a single line. Now since  Ptolemy declared that the planet \u03a9 on this line of vision \u039a\u03a9 is divested of its second inequality, he places the center of the epicycle \u0396 on the line \u039a\u03a9. But since \u039a\u03a3 has gone beyond \u039a\u03a5, the sun\u2019s apparent position is beyond opposition to the planet. And in the last part of the time, \u039a\u03a9 is not descending, so as to be opposite \u039a\u03a3, but ascends towards \u039a\u03a6, because the lowest parts of the epicycle \u03a9 are retrograde and swifter than the center \u0396, and it is there, of course, that the planet is at opposition to the sun. Therefore, this apparent opposition precedes the mean one.\nTherefore, at some time preceding the moment designated by \u039a\u03a5 (let it be \u039a\u0398) when the sun is seen on the line \u039a\u039e, the planet will be seen opposite it (suppose it to be at \u0399) on \u039a\u0399 which forms a straight line with \u039a\u039e. Also, because it is now laid down that it sheds the second inequality at this true opposition, the center of the epicycle will also be seen on this line \u039e\u039a, say at \u039f. And because the planet is retrograde, at the time \u039a\u0398 prior to \u039a\u03a5 the planet is on the line \u039a\u0399 later than at \u039a\u03a9. But \u039a\u0399 and \u039a\u03a9 are parts of the lines \u039a\u039f and \u039a\u0396. Therefore, \u039a\u039f too is more to the east than \u039a\u0396.\nThus it is clear what would be changed on the line of the epicycle\u2019s center by this restoration from the sun\u2019s mean position to its apparent position. For at \u03a4 and the opposite point on the original line the motions of the epicycle\u2019s center remain unchanged. At \u0396 this line, and the center of the epicycle upon it, is moved forward and a subtraction is made from the intervening time. At the opposite place the contrary happens: an addition is made to the time, and the line of motion of the center of the epicycle is moved back westward. And thus these lines of the center of the epicycle differ much from the original lines. For this reason also, when we investigate the causes and measure of the first inequality by a new and repeated operation using these several observed positions of the center of the epicycle (that is, using the observed positions of the planet, after which we suppose the center of the epicycle to lie upon the same line), the outcome of this operation differs much from that of the preceding one. That is, since the time in the semicircle containing the apogee will have been diminished, so that the planet is correspondingly faster, the eccentricity of the equant will come out smaller. And since in the greater quadrant \u0392\u0396 of the semicircle containing the apogee the time will have been diminished by an amount equal to the diminution in the other, smaller part, the planet has been made proportionally much faster in the remaining part of the semicircle. Therefore, the perigee has come closer to the latter, and the apogee has descended from \u03a7 towards \u0396.\nThe quantification of the new hypothesis will be made clear thus. It is presupposed that the planet \u03a9 falls on the line drawn from the center of the epicycle \u0396 through the earth \u039a, only when \u039a\u0396 is collinear with \u039a\u03a3, the sun\u2019s apparent position. Therefore, \u039a\u03a3 and the line drawn from \u0396 through the body of the planet always proceed in parallel. Moreover, we have just taken it from Ptolemy that at the time when the line of the sun\u2019s mean position was \u039a\u03a5, drawn through \u03a9, the planet was observed on the line \u039a\u03a9, and nonetheless we do not grant him that the center of the epicycle \u0396 is on \u039a\u03a9 at the same time. Therefore, in accord with our position, let a line be drawn from the planet\u2019s position \u03a9 parallel to \u039a\u03a3, and let this be \u03a9\u039f. We are supposing that the center of the epicycle is at this moment on the line \u03a9\u039f, or some other line nearby and parallel, according as \u03a9 (representing the planet) is closer to or farther from \u039a on the line \u039a\u0396. Let \u03a9\u039f be drawn from whatever point on the line \u039a\u0396 (now, it is \u03a9), equal to \u03a9\u0396. From \u039f let a line be drawn to \u0396\u039a parallel to \u039a\u03a8, and let this be \u039f\u0396. Now since \u0396\u03a9\u039f is equal to \u039a\u03a3\u03a8, and \u039a\u03a3 is imperceptibly greater than \u03a8\u03a3  or \u03a9\u039f (because \u039a\u03a8\u03a3 is right, and the angle at \u03a3 is not greater than 2\u00b0 3\u2019, so that if \u03a8\u03a3 is 100,000, \u039a\u03a3 is 100,064), \u039f\u0396 is also imperceptibly less than \u039a\u03a8. Let \u0396\u0394 be joined, and let a line be drawn at \u039f parallel to \u0396\u0394. Now the moment of time at which the center of the epicycle is placed at \u0396 by Ptolemy and at \u039f by me, is the same, and is designated by both of us by the line \u039a\u03a5 in the theory of the sun. In the theory of Mars, that moment should be designated in the former theory by \u0396\u0394, because \u0394 is the point of equality, while in the new theory it will be designated by a line parallel to \u0396\u0394. Therefore, there will be a new point of equality, about which the time is counted, on this parallel through \u039f. ","665":"Now Ptolemy measured out the courses of the planets, not on the lines \u039a\u03a3, but on the lines \u039a\u03a5 drawn from \u039a parallel to the lines \u03a8\u03a3 passing through the sun\u2019s body. For whenever the planet fell upon these lines \u039a\u03a5 on the side opposite the sun, it was supposed to have shed its second inequality, which fell to it (in Ptolemy\u2019s opinion) because of the epicycle.

Again (as before) when the sun \u0393, the center of the sun\u2019s eccentric \u03a8, and the earth \u039a are on the same line, so that the line of the sun\u2019s apparent position \u03a8\u0393 and the line of its mean position \u039a\u0393 coincide, then for the center of the epicycle \u03a4 this place remains the same, whether its sidereal position is designated by \u039a\u03a4 or by \u03a8\u03a4, and the planet is really on the line \u039a\u03a4 or \u03a8\u03a4 and at the lowest point on its epicycle \u03a6, since here it is nearest to both \u03a8 and \u039a. The planet is thereby truly divested of its second inequality. But when the sun comes to the side of its eccentric (that is, to the middle distances), a great enough difference arises. For let the sun have gone from \u0393 to \u03a3, and the line of the sun\u2019s mean position \u039a\u03a5 be found in Aries, and the planet\u2019s line of vision \u039a\u03a9 precisely opposite in Libra, so that \u03a5\u039a\u03a9 is a single line. Now since  Ptolemy declared that the planet \u03a9 on this line of vision \u039a\u03a9 is divested of its second inequality, he places the center of the epicycle \u0396 on the line \u039a\u03a9. But since \u039a\u03a3 has gone beyond \u039a\u03a5, the sun\u2019s apparent position is beyond opposition to the planet. And in the last part of the time, \u039a\u03a9 is not descending, so as to be opposite \u039a\u03a3, but ascends towards \u039a\u03a6, because the lowest parts of the epicycle \u03a9 are retrograde and swifter than the center \u0396, and it is there, of course, that the planet is at opposition to the sun. Therefore, this apparent opposition precedes the mean one.\nTherefore, at some time preceding the moment designated by \u039a\u03a5 (let it be \u039a\u0398) when the sun is seen on the line \u039a\u039e, the planet will be seen opposite it (suppose it to be at \u0399) on \u039a\u0399 which forms a straight line with \u039a\u039e. Also, because it is now laid down that it sheds the second inequality at this true opposition, the center of the epicycle will also be seen on this line \u039e\u039a, say at \u039f. And because the planet is retrograde, at the time \u039a\u0398 prior to \u039a\u03a5 the planet is on the line \u039a\u0399 later than at \u039a\u03a9. But \u039a\u0399 and \u039a\u03a9 are parts of the lines \u039a\u039f and \u039a\u0396. Therefore, \u039a\u039f too is more to the east than \u039a\u0396.\nThus it is clear what would be changed on the line of the epicycle\u2019s center by this restoration from the sun\u2019s mean position to its apparent position. For at \u03a4 and the opposite point on the original line the motions of the epicycle\u2019s center remain unchanged. At \u0396 this line, and the center of the epicycle upon it, is moved forward and a subtraction is made from the intervening time. At the opposite place the contrary happens: an addition is made to the time, and the line of motion of the center of the epicycle is moved back westward.

Therefore, the perigee has come closer to the latter, and the apogee has descended from \u03a7 towards \u0396.\nThe quantification of the new hypothesis will be made clear thus. It is presupposed that the planet \u03a9 falls on the line drawn from the center of the epicycle \u0396 through the earth \u039a, only when \u039a\u0396 is collinear with \u039a\u03a3, the sun\u2019s apparent position. Therefore, \u039a\u03a3 and the line drawn from \u0396 through the body of the planet always proceed in parallel. Moreover, we have just taken it from Ptolemy that at the time when the line of the sun\u2019s mean position was \u039a\u03a5, drawn through \u03a9, the planet was observed on the line \u039a\u03a9, and nonetheless we do not grant him that the center of the epicycle \u0396 is on \u039a\u03a9 at the same time. Therefore, in accord with our position, let a line be drawn from the planet\u2019s position \u03a9 parallel to \u039a\u03a3, and let this be \u03a9\u039f. We are supposing that the center of the epicycle is at this moment on the line \u03a9\u039f, or some other line nearby and parallel, according as \u03a9 (representing the planet) is closer to or farther from \u039a on the line \u039a\u0396. Let \u03a9\u039f be drawn from whatever point on the line \u039a\u0396 (now, it is \u03a9), equal to \u03a9\u0396. From \u039f let a line be drawn to \u0396\u039a parallel to \u039a\u03a8, and let this be \u039f\u0396. Now since \u0396\u03a9\u039f is equal to \u039a\u03a3\u03a8, and \u039a\u03a3 is imperceptibly greater than \u03a8\u03a3  or \u03a9\u039f (because \u039a\u03a8\u03a3 is right, and the angle at \u03a3 is not greater than 2\u00b0 3\u2019, so that if \u03a8\u03a3 is 100,000, \u039a\u03a3 is 100,064), \u039f\u0396 is also imperceptibly less than \u039a\u03a8. Let \u0396\u0394 be joined, and let a line be drawn at \u039f parallel to \u0396\u0394. Now the moment of time at which the center of the epicycle is placed at \u0396 by Ptolemy and at \u039f by me, is the same, and is designated by both of us by the line \u039a\u03a5 in the theory of the sun. In the theory of Mars, that moment should be designated in the former theory by \u0396\u0394, because \u0394 is the point of equality, while in the new theory it will be designated by a line parallel to \u0396\u0394. Therefore, there will be a new point of equality, about which the time is counted, on this parallel through \u039f. ","666":"Now Ptolemy measured out the courses of the planets, not on the lines \u039a\u03a3, but on the lines \u039a\u03a5 drawn from \u039a parallel to the lines \u03a8\u03a3 passing through the sun\u2019s body. For whenever the planet fell upon these lines \u039a\u03a5 on the side opposite the sun, it was supposed to have shed its second inequality, which fell to it (in Ptolemy\u2019s opinion) because of the epicycle. Then the planet\u2019s sidereal position was sought out by means of instruments, and the center of the epicycle was supposed to be found at that time on the same line. This was done a number of times and at various places on the zodiac: say, \u039a\u0393, \u039a\u03a5, and the points opposite. From three such positions of the planet (or of the center of the epicycle, which, according to Ptolemy, accounts for the second inequality), the practitioner sets out to investigate the hypothesis for the first inequality by comparing these angles which the observed positions form about \u039a, the center of the earth and of observation, with the intervening times. The method for this enterprise is found in Ptolemy Book IX ^19. Now suppose the treatment done, and let the eccentric's line of apsides come out to be \u039a\u039b\u0394\u03a7, with \u0394 the equalizing point, the center of the eccentric upon this line and at point \u039b, and the eccentric \u03a7\u0396. And let this hypothesis correspond to all positions observed at the times of the planet\u2019s opposition to the sun\u2019s mean position.\nHere, the objections I raised against Copernicus concerning the ordering of the physical motion are also not clearly in agreement with Ptolemy. For the center of the epicycle which accounts for the second inequality, here just as the planet itself previously, is borne slowly or swiftly according to its approach  to or recession from the earth \u039a, performed on the circle \u03a7\u0396. Furthermore, to stipulate that there is in the earth \u039a (just as there was before in Copernicus\u2019s sun, the heart of the world) a motive force that drives the centers of this kind of epicycle around, is absurd and monstrous. The hypothesis can also be discredited by another physical argument. For intrinsic to this form of hypothesis, in one way or another, is solidity of the orbs; and since this has been destroyed (by Tycho Brahe\u2019s observations of comets), the hypothesis appears, so to speak, to collapse under its own weight. For a moving force would be declared to reside in the center of the epicycle (not in a body, but in a mathematical point), and to rouse itself to move from place to place, by an unequal amount in equal times; but at the same time would draw the planet along with itself at the distance of the epicycle\u2019s diameter; all the while causing the planet to gyrate around itself, by equal amounts in equal times. That this enormous variety cannot fall to a single moving mind (unless it be God), Aristotle gives supporting arguments in the Metaphysics Book XII Ch. 8: he holds that the individual minds preside over individual, perfectly uniform and simple circular motions. Besides, how will some power sit in a non-body, and flow out of the non-body into the planet? Even if you divide up the tasks, and locate one motive intelligence at the center of the epicycle and another in the body of the planet, the one at the center will use the earth (a body, of course) as its reference, and will move around the earth nonuniformly in a circle, while the one at a point on the circumference (that is, in the planet's body) will move around an incorporeal center and do so uniformly. The question, then, is (as before), by what aids would it move around the incorporeal point? Not by geometrical imagination, for it does not admit of geometrical imagination of itself. Nor can a mobile point subsist in a non-body even in imagination. We humans, in imagining points of this sort, have recourse to the aids of tablets or paper, which we draw upon with our hands or at least remember ourselves to have drawn once. But it likewise cannot happen through a physical flowing of power (which is in the center of the epicycle) out to the circumference and the planet\u2019s body. For we have submitted to this outflow of power on the supposition that the tasks of the compound motions are divided between two minds. Why not also question whether in the first, eccentric motion, some natural force constituted to produce motion might subsist in some point entirely devoid of any body? And even more, whether this kind of incorporeal power can move itself around the earth, and go from place to place? And most of all, whether it can communicate or transfer another's motion through an efflux from itself, although it is not supported by any body that could serve as its nest? Those sublime considerations of the essence, motion, place, and operations of the blessed angels and of separate minds which some people will want to raise in opposition to me, are irrelevant. For we are arguing about natural things which are far inferior in dignity, about powers that exercise no choice of how to vary their action, and about minds which are not in the least separate, since they are yoked and bound to the celestial bodies which they are to bear. These, then, are the general objections that can be raised against  Ptolemy. \nBut something further may be said to Ptolemy, on account of which in particular he would wish to abandon his mean position of the sun and embrace the apparent with us. For if the power moving the planet (whether single or double) acts with respect to the sun, so that it places the planet at the lowest point of the epicycle whenever the center of the epicycle is opposite the sun, I ask (as above) why it looks to the imaginary point \u03a5 (which sometimes precedes and sometimes follows the sun, here marked \u03a3, and is sometimes above and sometimes below it), rather than the sun's body itself? Or how it is that that power can have any perception whatever of the motion of \u03a5 around the earth K, since there is no body at \u03a8? Is it not more probable that the epicycle is restored to the lines \u039a\u03a3 of the sun\u2019s apparent position, when these pass through the center of the epicycle?\n Let us then see what is changed on the eccentric by substitution of the sun\u2019s apparent position. Again (as before) when the sun \u0393, the center of the sun\u2019s eccentric \u03a8, and the earth \u039a are on the same line, so that the line of the sun\u2019s apparent position \u03a8\u0393 and the line of its mean position \u039a\u0393 coincide, then for the center of the epicycle \u03a4 this place remains the same, whether its sidereal position is designated by \u039a\u03a4 or by \u03a8\u03a4, and the planet is really on the line \u039a\u03a4 or \u03a8\u03a4 and at the lowest point on its epicycle \u03a6, since here it is nearest to both \u03a8 and \u039a. The planet is thereby truly divested of its second inequality. But when the sun comes to the side of its eccentric (that is, to the middle distances), a great enough difference arises. For let the sun have gone from \u0393 to \u03a3, and the line of the sun\u2019s mean position \u039a\u03a5 be found in Aries, and the planet\u2019s line of vision \u039a\u03a9 precisely opposite in Libra, so that \u03a5\u039a\u03a9 is a single line. Now since  Ptolemy declared that the planet \u03a9 on this line of vision \u039a\u03a9 is divested of its second inequality, he places the center of the epicycle \u0396 on the line \u039a\u03a9. But since \u039a\u03a3 has gone beyond \u039a\u03a5, the sun\u2019s apparent position is beyond opposition to the planet. And in the last part of the time, \u039a\u03a9 is not descending, so as to be opposite \u039a\u03a3, but ascends towards \u039a\u03a6, because the lowest parts of the epicycle \u03a9 are retrograde and swifter than the center \u0396, and it is there, of course, that the planet is at opposition to the sun. Therefore, this apparent opposition precedes the mean one.\nTherefore, at some time preceding the moment designated by \u039a\u03a5 (let it be \u039a\u0398) when the sun is seen on the line \u039a\u039e, the planet will be seen opposite it (suppose it to be at \u0399) on \u039a\u0399 which forms a straight line with \u039a\u039e. Also, because it is now laid down that it sheds the second inequality at this true opposition, the center of the epicycle will also be seen on this line \u039e\u039a, say at \u039f. And because the planet is retrograde, at the time \u039a\u0398 prior to \u039a\u03a5 the planet is on the line \u039a\u0399 later than at \u039a\u03a9. But \u039a\u0399 and \u039a\u03a9 are parts of the lines \u039a\u039f and \u039a\u0396. Therefore, \u039a\u039f too is more to the east than \u039a\u0396.\nThus it is clear what would be changed on the line of the epicycle\u2019s center by this restoration from the sun\u2019s mean position to its apparent position. For at \u03a4 and the opposite point on the original line the motions of the epicycle\u2019s center remain unchanged. At \u0396 this line, and the center of the epicycle upon it, is moved forward and a subtraction is made from the intervening time. At the opposite place the contrary happens: an addition is made to the time, and the line of motion of the center of the epicycle is moved back westward. And thus these lines of the center of the epicycle differ much from the original lines. For this reason also, when we investigate the causes and measure of the first inequality by a new and repeated operation using these several observed positions of the center of the epicycle (that is, using the observed positions of the planet, after which we suppose the center of the epicycle to lie upon the same line), the outcome of this operation differs much from that of the preceding one. That is, since the time in the semicircle containing the apogee will have been diminished, so that the planet is correspondingly faster, the eccentricity of the equant will come out smaller. And since in the greater quadrant \u0392\u0396 of the semicircle containing the apogee the time will have been diminished by an amount equal to the diminution in the other, smaller part, the planet has been made proportionally much faster in the remaining part of the semicircle. Therefore, the perigee has come closer to the latter, and the apogee has descended from \u03a7 towards \u0396.\nThe quantification of the new hypothesis will be made clear thus. It is presupposed that the planet \u03a9 falls on the line drawn from the center of the epicycle \u0396 through the earth \u039a, only when \u039a\u0396 is collinear with \u039a\u03a3, the sun\u2019s apparent position. Therefore, \u039a\u03a3 and the line drawn from \u0396 through the body of the planet always proceed in parallel. Moreover, we have just taken it from Ptolemy that at the time when the line of the sun\u2019s mean position was \u039a\u03a5, drawn through \u03a9, the planet was observed on the line \u039a\u03a9, and nonetheless we do not grant him that the center of the epicycle \u0396 is on \u039a\u03a9 at the same time. Therefore, in accord with our position, let a line be drawn from the planet\u2019s position \u03a9 parallel to \u039a\u03a3, and let this be \u03a9\u039f. We are supposing that the center of the epicycle is at this moment on the line \u03a9\u039f, or some other line nearby and parallel, according as \u03a9 (representing the planet) is closer to or farther from \u039a on the line \u039a\u0396. Let \u03a9\u039f be drawn from whatever point on the line \u039a\u0396 (now, it is \u03a9), equal to \u03a9\u0396. From \u039f let a line be drawn to \u0396\u039a parallel to \u039a\u03a8, and let this be \u039f\u0396. Now since \u0396\u03a9\u039f is equal to \u039a\u03a3\u03a8, and \u039a\u03a3 is imperceptibly greater than \u03a8\u03a3  or \u03a9\u039f (because \u039a\u03a8\u03a3 is right, and the angle at \u03a3 is not greater than 2\u00b0 3\u2019, so that if \u03a8\u03a3 is 100,000, \u039a\u03a3 is 100,064), \u039f\u0396 is also imperceptibly less than \u039a\u03a8. Let \u0396\u0394 be joined, and let a line be drawn at \u039f parallel to \u0396\u0394. Now the moment of time at which the center of the epicycle is placed at \u0396 by Ptolemy and at \u039f by me, is the same, and is designated by both of us by the line \u039a\u03a5 in the theory of the sun. In the theory of Mars, that moment should be designated in the former theory by \u0396\u0394, because \u0394 is the point of equality, while in the new theory it will be designated by a line parallel to \u0396\u0394. Therefore, there will be a new point of equality, about which the time is counted, on this parallel through \u039f. ","667":"Now Ptolemy measured out the courses of the planets, not on the lines \u039a\u03a3, but on the lines \u039a\u03a5 drawn from \u039a parallel to the lines \u03a8\u03a3 passing through the sun\u2019s body. For whenever the planet fell upon these lines \u039a\u03a5 on the side opposite the sun, it was supposed to have shed its second inequality, which fell to it (in Ptolemy\u2019s opinion) because of the epicycle.

Is it not more probable that the epicycle is restored to the lines \u039a\u03a3 of the sun\u2019s apparent position, when these pass through the center of the epicycle?\n Let us then see what is changed on the eccentric by substitution of the sun\u2019s apparent position. Again (as before) when the sun \u0393, the center of the sun\u2019s eccentric \u03a8, and the earth \u039a are on the same line, so that the line of the sun\u2019s apparent position \u03a8\u0393 and the line of its mean position \u039a\u0393 coincide, then for the center of the epicycle \u03a4 this place remains the same, whether its sidereal position is designated by \u039a\u03a4 or by \u03a8\u03a4, and the planet is really on the line \u039a\u03a4 or \u03a8\u03a4 and at the lowest point on its epicycle \u03a6, since here it is nearest to both \u03a8 and \u039a. The planet is thereby truly divested of its second inequality. But when the sun comes to the side of its eccentric (that is, to the middle distances), a great enough difference arises. For let the sun have gone from \u0393 to \u03a3, and the line of the sun\u2019s mean position \u039a\u03a5 be found in Aries, and the planet\u2019s line of vision \u039a\u03a9 precisely opposite in Libra, so that \u03a5\u039a\u03a9 is a single line. Now since  Ptolemy declared that the planet \u03a9 on this line of vision \u039a\u03a9 is divested of its second inequality, he places the center of the epicycle \u0396 on the line \u039a\u03a9. But since \u039a\u03a3 has gone beyond \u039a\u03a5, the sun\u2019s apparent position is beyond opposition to the planet. And in the last part of the time, \u039a\u03a9 is not descending, so as to be opposite \u039a\u03a3, but ascends towards \u039a\u03a6, because the lowest parts of the epicycle \u03a9 are retrograde and swifter than the center \u0396, and it is there, of course, that the planet is at opposition to the sun. Therefore, this apparent opposition precedes the mean one.\nTherefore, at some time preceding the moment designated by \u039a\u03a5 (let it be \u039a\u0398) when the sun is seen on the line \u039a\u039e, the planet will be seen opposite it (suppose it to be at \u0399) on \u039a\u0399 which forms a straight line with \u039a\u039e. Also, because it is now laid down that it sheds the second inequality at this true opposition, the center of the epicycle will also be seen on this line \u039e\u039a, say at \u039f. And because the planet is retrograde, at the time \u039a\u0398 prior to \u039a\u03a5 the planet is on the line \u039a\u0399 later than at \u039a\u03a9. But \u039a\u0399 and \u039a\u03a9 are parts of the lines \u039a\u039f and \u039a\u0396. Therefore, \u039a\u039f too is more to the east than \u039a\u0396.\nThus it is clear what would be changed on the line of the epicycle\u2019s center by this restoration from the sun\u2019s mean position to its apparent position. For at \u03a4 and the opposite point on the original line the motions of the epicycle\u2019s center remain unchanged. At \u0396 this line, and the center of the epicycle upon it, is moved forward and a subtraction is made from the intervening time. At the opposite place the contrary happens: an addition is made to the time, and the line of motion of the center of the epicycle is moved back westward. And thus these lines of the center of the epicycle differ much from the original lines. For this reason also, when we investigate the causes and measure of the first inequality by a new and repeated operation using these several observed positions of the center of the epicycle (that is, using the observed positions of the planet, after which we suppose the center of the epicycle to lie upon the same line), the outcome of this operation differs much from that of the preceding one. That is, since the time in the semicircle containing the apogee will have been diminished, so that the planet is correspondingly faster, the eccentricity of the equant will come out smaller. And since in the greater quadrant \u0392\u0396 of the semicircle containing the apogee the time will have been diminished by an amount equal to the diminution in the other, smaller part, the planet has been made proportionally much faster in the remaining part of the semicircle. Therefore, the perigee has come closer to the latter, and the apogee has descended from \u03a7 towards \u0396.\nThe quantification of the new hypothesis will be made clear thus. It is presupposed that the planet \u03a9 falls on the line drawn from the center of the epicycle \u0396 through the earth \u039a, only when \u039a\u0396 is collinear with \u039a\u03a3, the sun\u2019s apparent position. Therefore, \u039a\u03a3 and the line drawn from \u0396 through the body of the planet always proceed in parallel. Moreover, we have just taken it from Ptolemy that at the time when the line of the sun\u2019s mean position was \u039a\u03a5, drawn through \u03a9, the planet was observed on the line \u039a\u03a9, and nonetheless we do not grant him that the center of the epicycle \u0396 is on \u039a\u03a9 at the same time. Therefore, in accord with our position, let a line be drawn from the planet\u2019s position \u03a9 parallel to \u039a\u03a3, and let this be \u03a9\u039f. We are supposing that the center of the epicycle is at this moment on the line \u03a9\u039f, or some other line nearby and parallel, according as \u03a9 (representing the planet) is closer to or farther from \u039a on the line \u039a\u0396. Let \u03a9\u039f be drawn from whatever point on the line \u039a\u0396 (now, it is \u03a9), equal to \u03a9\u0396. From \u039f let a line be drawn to \u0396\u039a parallel to \u039a\u03a8, and let this be \u039f\u0396. Now since \u0396\u03a9\u039f is equal to \u039a\u03a3\u03a8, and \u039a\u03a3 is imperceptibly greater than \u03a8\u03a3  or \u03a9\u039f (because \u039a\u03a8\u03a3 is right, and the angle at \u03a3 is not greater than 2\u00b0 3\u2019, so that if \u03a8\u03a3 is 100,000, \u039a\u03a3 is 100,064), \u039f\u0396 is also imperceptibly less than \u039a\u03a8. Let \u0396\u0394 be joined, and let a line be drawn at \u039f parallel to \u0396\u0394. Now the moment of time at which the center of the epicycle is placed at \u0396 by Ptolemy and at \u039f by me, is the same, and is designated by both of us by the line \u039a\u03a5 in the theory of the sun. In the theory of Mars, that moment should be designated in the former theory by \u0396\u0394, because \u0394 is the point of equality, while in the new theory it will be designated by a line parallel to \u0396\u0394. Therefore, there will be a new point of equality, about which the time is counted, on this parallel through \u039f. ","668":"Now Ptolemy measured out the courses of the planets, not on the lines \u039a\u03a3, but on the lines \u039a\u03a5 drawn from \u039a parallel to the lines \u03a8\u03a3 passing through the sun\u2019s body. For whenever the planet fell upon these lines \u039a\u03a5 on the side opposite the sun, it was supposed to have shed its second inequality, which fell to it (in Ptolemy\u2019s opinion) because of the epicycle. Then the planet\u2019s sidereal position was sought out by means of instruments, and the center of the epicycle was supposed to be found at that time on the same line. This was done a number of times and at various places on the zodiac: say, \u039a\u0393, \u039a\u03a5, and the points opposite. From three such positions of the planet (or of the center of the epicycle, which, according to Ptolemy, accounts for the second inequality), the practitioner sets out to investigate the hypothesis for the first inequality by comparing these angles which the observed positions form about \u039a, the center of the earth and of observation, with the intervening times. The method for this enterprise is found in Ptolemy Book IX ^19. Now suppose the treatment done, and let the eccentric's line of apsides come out to be \u039a\u039b\u0394\u03a7, with \u0394 the equalizing point, the center of the eccentric upon this line and at point \u039b, and the eccentric \u03a7\u0396. And let this hypothesis correspond to all positions observed at the times of the planet\u2019s opposition to the sun\u2019s mean position.\nHere, the objections I raised against Copernicus concerning the ordering of the physical motion are also not clearly in agreement with Ptolemy. For the center of the epicycle which accounts for the second inequality, here just as the planet itself previously, is borne slowly or swiftly according to its approach  to or recession from the earth \u039a, performed on the circle \u03a7\u0396. Furthermore, to stipulate that there is in the earth \u039a (just as there was before in Copernicus\u2019s sun, the heart of the world) a motive force that drives the centers of this kind of epicycle around, is absurd and monstrous. The hypothesis can also be discredited by another physical argument. For intrinsic to this form of hypothesis, in one way or another, is solidity of the orbs; and since this has been destroyed (by Tycho Brahe\u2019s observations of comets), the hypothesis appears, so to speak, to collapse under its own weight. For a moving force would be declared to reside in the center of the epicycle (not in a body, but in a mathematical point), and to rouse itself to move from place to place, by an unequal amount in equal times; but at the same time would draw the planet along with itself at the distance of the epicycle\u2019s diameter; all the while causing the planet to gyrate around itself, by equal amounts in equal times. That this enormous variety cannot fall to a single moving mind (unless it be God), Aristotle gives supporting arguments in the Metaphysics Book XII Ch. 8: he holds that the individual minds preside over individual, perfectly uniform and simple circular motions. Besides, how will some power sit in a non-body, and flow out of the non-body into the planet? Even if you divide up the tasks, and locate one motive intelligence at the center of the epicycle and another in the body of the planet, the one at the center will use the earth (a body, of course) as its reference, and will move around the earth nonuniformly in a circle, while the one at a point on the circumference (that is, in the planet's body) will move around an incorporeal center and do so uniformly. The question, then, is (as before), by what aids would it move around the incorporeal point? Not by geometrical imagination, for it does not admit of geometrical imagination of itself. Nor can a mobile point subsist in a non-body even in imagination. We humans, in imagining points of this sort, have recourse to the aids of tablets or paper, which we draw upon with our hands or at least remember ourselves to have drawn once. But it likewise cannot happen through a physical flowing of power (which is in the center of the epicycle) out to the circumference and the planet\u2019s body. For we have submitted to this outflow of power on the supposition that the tasks of the compound motions are divided between two minds. Why not also question whether in the first, eccentric motion, some natural force constituted to produce motion might subsist in some point entirely devoid of any body? And even more, whether this kind of incorporeal power can move itself around the earth, and go from place to place? And most of all, whether it can communicate or transfer another's motion through an efflux from itself, although it is not supported by any body that could serve as its nest? Those sublime considerations of the essence, motion, place, and operations of the blessed angels and of separate minds which some people will want to raise in opposition to me, are irrelevant. For we are arguing about natural things which are far inferior in dignity, about powers that exercise no choice of how to vary their action, and about minds which are not in the least separate, since they are yoked and bound to the celestial bodies which they are to bear. These, then, are the general objections that can be raised against  Ptolemy. \nBut something further may be said to Ptolemy, on account of which in particular he would wish to abandon his mean position of the sun and embrace the apparent with us. For if the power moving the planet (whether single or double) acts with respect to the sun, so that it places the planet at the lowest point of the epicycle whenever the center of the epicycle is opposite the sun, I ask (as above) why it looks to the imaginary point \u03a5 (which sometimes precedes and sometimes follows the sun, here marked \u03a3, and is sometimes above and sometimes below it), rather than the sun's body itself? Or how it is that that power can have any perception whatever of the motion of \u03a5 around the earth K, since there is no body at \u03a8? Is it not more probable that the epicycle is restored to the lines \u039a\u03a3 of the sun\u2019s apparent position, when these pass through the center of the epicycle?\n Let us then see what is changed on the eccentric by substitution of the sun\u2019s apparent position. Again (as before) when the sun \u0393, the center of the sun\u2019s eccentric \u03a8, and the earth \u039a are on the same line, so that the line of the sun\u2019s apparent position \u03a8\u0393 and the line of its mean position \u039a\u0393 coincide, then for the center of the epicycle \u03a4 this place remains the same, whether its sidereal position is designated by \u039a\u03a4 or by \u03a8\u03a4, and the planet is really on the line \u039a\u03a4 or \u03a8\u03a4 and at the lowest point on its epicycle \u03a6, since here it is nearest to both \u03a8 and \u039a. The planet is thereby truly divested of its second inequality. But when the sun comes to the side of its eccentric (that is, to the middle distances), a great enough difference arises. For let the sun have gone from \u0393 to \u03a3, and the line of the sun\u2019s mean position \u039a\u03a5 be found in Aries, and the planet\u2019s line of vision \u039a\u03a9 precisely opposite in Libra, so that \u03a5\u039a\u03a9 is a single line. Now since  Ptolemy declared that the planet \u03a9 on this line of vision \u039a\u03a9 is divested of its second inequality, he places the center of the epicycle \u0396 on the line \u039a\u03a9. But since \u039a\u03a3 has gone beyond \u039a\u03a5, the sun\u2019s apparent position is beyond opposition to the planet. And in the last part of the time, \u039a\u03a9 is not descending, so as to be opposite \u039a\u03a3, but ascends towards \u039a\u03a6, because the lowest parts of the epicycle \u03a9 are retrograde and swifter than the center \u0396, and it is there, of course, that the planet is at opposition to the sun. Therefore, this apparent opposition precedes the mean one.\nTherefore, at some time preceding the moment designated by \u039a\u03a5 (let it be \u039a\u0398) when the sun is seen on the line \u039a\u039e, the planet will be seen opposite it (suppose it to be at \u0399) on \u039a\u0399 which forms a straight line with \u039a\u039e. Also, because it is now laid down that it sheds the second inequality at this true opposition, the center of the epicycle will also be seen on this line \u039e\u039a, say at \u039f. And because the planet is retrograde, at the time \u039a\u0398 prior to \u039a\u03a5 the planet is on the line \u039a\u0399 later than at \u039a\u03a9. But \u039a\u0399 and \u039a\u03a9 are parts of the lines \u039a\u039f and \u039a\u0396. Therefore, \u039a\u039f too is more to the east than \u039a\u0396.\nThus it is clear what would be changed on the line of the epicycle\u2019s center by this restoration from the sun\u2019s mean position to its apparent position. For at \u03a4 and the opposite point on the original line the motions of the epicycle\u2019s center remain unchanged. At \u0396 this line, and the center of the epicycle upon it, is moved forward and a subtraction is made from the intervening time. At the opposite place the contrary happens: an addition is made to the time, and the line of motion of the center of the epicycle is moved back westward. And thus these lines of the center of the epicycle differ much from the original lines. For this reason also, when we investigate the causes and measure of the first inequality by a new and repeated operation using these several observed positions of the center of the epicycle (that is, using the observed positions of the planet, after which we suppose the center of the epicycle to lie upon the same line), the outcome of this operation differs much from that of the preceding one. That is, since the time in the semicircle containing the apogee will have been diminished, so that the planet is correspondingly faster, the eccentricity of the equant will come out smaller. And since in the greater quadrant \u0392\u0396 of the semicircle containing the apogee the time will have been diminished by an amount equal to the diminution in the other, smaller part, the planet has been made proportionally much faster in the remaining part of the semicircle. Therefore, the perigee has come closer to the latter, and the apogee has descended from \u03a7 towards \u0396.\nThe quantification of the new hypothesis will be made clear thus. It is presupposed that the planet \u03a9 falls on the line drawn from the center of the epicycle \u0396 through the earth \u039a, only when \u039a\u0396 is collinear with \u039a\u03a3, the sun\u2019s apparent position. Therefore, \u039a\u03a3 and the line drawn from \u0396 through the body of the planet always proceed in parallel. Moreover, we have just taken it from Ptolemy that at the time when the line of the sun\u2019s mean position was \u039a\u03a5, drawn through \u03a9, the planet was observed on the line \u039a\u03a9, and nonetheless we do not grant him that the center of the epicycle \u0396 is on \u039a\u03a9 at the same time. Therefore, in accord with our position, let a line be drawn from the planet\u2019s position \u03a9 parallel to \u039a\u03a3, and let this be \u03a9\u039f. We are supposing that the center of the epicycle is at this moment on the line \u03a9\u039f, or some other line nearby and parallel, according as \u03a9 (representing the planet) is closer to or farther from \u039a on the line \u039a\u0396. Let \u03a9\u039f be drawn from whatever point on the line \u039a\u0396 (now, it is \u03a9), equal to \u03a9\u0396. From \u039f let a line be drawn to \u0396\u039a parallel to \u039a\u03a8, and let this be \u039f\u0396. Now since \u0396\u03a9\u039f is equal to \u039a\u03a3\u03a8, and \u039a\u03a3 is imperceptibly greater than \u03a8\u03a3  or \u03a9\u039f (because \u039a\u03a8\u03a3 is right, and the angle at \u03a3 is not greater than 2\u00b0 3\u2019, so that if \u03a8\u03a3 is 100,000, \u039a\u03a3 is 100,064), \u039f\u0396 is also imperceptibly less than \u039a\u03a8. Let \u0396\u0394 be joined, and let a line be drawn at \u039f parallel to \u0396\u0394. Now the moment of time at which the center of the epicycle is placed at \u0396 by Ptolemy and at \u039f by me, is the same, and is designated by both of us by the line \u039a\u03a5 in the theory of the sun. In the theory of Mars, that moment should be designated in the former theory by \u0396\u0394, because \u0394 is the point of equality, while in the new theory it will be designated by a line parallel to \u0396\u0394. Therefore, there will be a new point of equality, about which the time is counted, on this parallel through \u039f. ","669":"Now Ptolemy measured out the courses of the planets, not on the lines \u039a\u03a3, but on the lines \u039a\u03a5 drawn from \u039a parallel to the lines \u03a8\u03a3 passing through the sun\u2019s body.

Now since  Ptolemy declared that the planet \u03a9 on this line of vision \u039a\u03a9 is divested of its second inequality, he places the center of the epicycle \u0396 on the line \u039a\u03a9. But since \u039a\u03a3 has gone beyond \u039a\u03a5, the sun\u2019s apparent position is beyond opposition to the planet. And in the last part of the time, \u039a\u03a9 is not descending, so as to be opposite \u039a\u03a3, but ascends towards \u039a\u03a6, because the lowest parts of the epicycle \u03a9 are retrograde and swifter than the center \u0396, and it is there, of course, that the planet is at opposition to the sun. Therefore, this apparent opposition precedes the mean one.\nTherefore, at some time preceding the moment designated by \u039a\u03a5 (let it be \u039a\u0398) when the sun is seen on the line \u039a\u039e, the planet will be seen opposite it (suppose it to be at \u0399) on \u039a\u0399 which forms a straight line with \u039a\u039e. Also, because it is now laid down that it sheds the second inequality at this true opposition, the center of the epicycle will also be seen on this line \u039e\u039a, say at \u039f.

But \u039a\u0399 and \u039a\u03a9 are parts of the lines \u039a\u039f and \u039a\u0396. Therefore, \u039a\u039f too is more to the east than \u039a\u0396.\nThus it is clear what would be changed on the line of the epicycle\u2019s center by this restoration from the sun\u2019s mean position to its apparent position. For at \u03a4 and the opposite point on the original line the motions of the epicycle\u2019s center remain unchanged.

Therefore, the perigee has come closer to the latter, and the apogee has descended from \u03a7 towards \u0396.\nThe quantification of the new hypothesis will be made clear thus. It is presupposed that the planet \u03a9 falls on the line drawn from the center of the epicycle \u0396 through the earth \u039a, only when \u039a\u0396 is collinear with \u039a\u03a3, the sun\u2019s apparent position. Therefore, \u039a\u03a3 and the line drawn from \u0396 through the body of the planet always proceed in parallel. Moreover, we have just taken it from Ptolemy that at the time when the line of the sun\u2019s mean position was \u039a\u03a5, drawn through \u03a9, the planet was observed on the line \u039a\u03a9, and nonetheless we do not grant him that the center of the epicycle \u0396 is on \u039a\u03a9 at the same time. Therefore, in accord with our position, let a line be drawn from the planet\u2019s position \u03a9 parallel to \u039a\u03a3, and let this be \u03a9\u039f. We are supposing that the center of the epicycle is at this moment on the line \u03a9\u039f, or some other line nearby and parallel, according as \u03a9 (representing the planet) is closer to or farther from \u039a on the line \u039a\u0396. Let \u03a9\u039f be drawn from whatever point on the line \u039a\u0396 (now, it is \u03a9), equal to \u03a9\u0396. From \u039f let a line be drawn to \u0396\u039a parallel to \u039a\u03a8, and let this be \u039f\u0396. Now since \u0396\u03a9\u039f is equal to \u039a\u03a3\u03a8, and \u039a\u03a3 is imperceptibly greater than \u03a8\u03a3  or \u03a9\u039f (because \u039a\u03a8\u03a3 is right, and the angle at \u03a3 is not greater than 2\u00b0 3\u2019, so that if \u03a8\u03a3 is 100,000, \u039a\u03a3 is 100,064), \u039f\u0396 is also imperceptibly less than \u039a\u03a8. Let \u0396\u0394 be joined, and let a line be drawn at \u039f parallel to \u0396\u0394. Now the moment of time at which the center of the epicycle is placed at \u0396 by Ptolemy and at \u039f by me, is the same, and is designated by both of us by the line \u039a\u03a5 in the theory of the sun. In the theory of Mars, that moment should be designated in the former theory by \u0396\u0394, because \u0394 is the point of equality, while in the new theory it will be designated by a line parallel to \u0396\u0394. Therefore, there will be a new point of equality, about which the time is counted, on this parallel through \u039f. ","670":"Now Ptolemy measured out the courses of the planets, not on the lines \u039a\u03a3, but on the lines \u039a\u03a5 drawn from \u039a parallel to the lines \u03a8\u03a3 passing through the sun\u2019s body. For whenever the planet fell upon these lines \u039a\u03a5 on the side opposite the sun, it was supposed to have shed its second inequality, which fell to it (in Ptolemy\u2019s opinion) because of the epicycle. Then the planet\u2019s sidereal position was sought out by means of instruments, and the center of the epicycle was supposed to be found at that time on the same line. This was done a number of times and at various places on the zodiac: say, \u039a\u0393, \u039a\u03a5, and the points opposite. From three such positions of the planet (or of the center of the epicycle, which, according to Ptolemy, accounts for the second inequality), the practitioner sets out to investigate the hypothesis for the first inequality by comparing these angles which the observed positions form about \u039a, the center of the earth and of observation, with the intervening times. The method for this enterprise is found in Ptolemy Book IX ^19. Now suppose the treatment done, and let the eccentric's line of apsides come out to be \u039a\u039b\u0394\u03a7, with \u0394 the equalizing point, the center of the eccentric upon this line and at point \u039b, and the eccentric \u03a7\u0396. And let this hypothesis correspond to all positions observed at the times of the planet\u2019s opposition to the sun\u2019s mean position.\nHere, the objections I raised against Copernicus concerning the ordering of the physical motion are also not clearly in agreement with Ptolemy. For the center of the epicycle which accounts for the second inequality, here just as the planet itself previously, is borne slowly or swiftly according to its approach  to or recession from the earth \u039a, performed on the circle \u03a7\u0396. Furthermore, to stipulate that there is in the earth \u039a (just as there was before in Copernicus\u2019s sun, the heart of the world) a motive force that drives the centers of this kind of epicycle around, is absurd and monstrous. The hypothesis can also be discredited by another physical argument. For intrinsic to this form of hypothesis, in one way or another, is solidity of the orbs; and since this has been destroyed (by Tycho Brahe\u2019s observations of comets), the hypothesis appears, so to speak, to collapse under its own weight. For a moving force would be declared to reside in the center of the epicycle (not in a body, but in a mathematical point), and to rouse itself to move from place to place, by an unequal amount in equal times; but at the same time would draw the planet along with itself at the distance of the epicycle\u2019s diameter; all the while causing the planet to gyrate around itself, by equal amounts in equal times. That this enormous variety cannot fall to a single moving mind (unless it be God), Aristotle gives supporting arguments in the Metaphysics Book XII Ch. 8: he holds that the individual minds preside over individual, perfectly uniform and simple circular motions. Besides, how will some power sit in a non-body, and flow out of the non-body into the planet? Even if you divide up the tasks, and locate one motive intelligence at the center of the epicycle and another in the body of the planet, the one at the center will use the earth (a body, of course) as its reference, and will move around the earth nonuniformly in a circle, while the one at a point on the circumference (that is, in the planet's body) will move around an incorporeal center and do so uniformly. The question, then, is (as before), by what aids would it move around the incorporeal point? Not by geometrical imagination, for it does not admit of geometrical imagination of itself. Nor can a mobile point subsist in a non-body even in imagination. We humans, in imagining points of this sort, have recourse to the aids of tablets or paper, which we draw upon with our hands or at least remember ourselves to have drawn once. But it likewise cannot happen through a physical flowing of power (which is in the center of the epicycle) out to the circumference and the planet\u2019s body. For we have submitted to this outflow of power on the supposition that the tasks of the compound motions are divided between two minds. Why not also question whether in the first, eccentric motion, some natural force constituted to produce motion might subsist in some point entirely devoid of any body? And even more, whether this kind of incorporeal power can move itself around the earth, and go from place to place? And most of all, whether it can communicate or transfer another's motion through an efflux from itself, although it is not supported by any body that could serve as its nest? Those sublime considerations of the essence, motion, place, and operations of the blessed angels and of separate minds which some people will want to raise in opposition to me, are irrelevant. For we are arguing about natural things which are far inferior in dignity, about powers that exercise no choice of how to vary their action, and about minds which are not in the least separate, since they are yoked and bound to the celestial bodies which they are to bear. These, then, are the general objections that can be raised against  Ptolemy. \nBut something further may be said to Ptolemy, on account of which in particular he would wish to abandon his mean position of the sun and embrace the apparent with us. For if the power moving the planet (whether single or double) acts with respect to the sun, so that it places the planet at the lowest point of the epicycle whenever the center of the epicycle is opposite the sun, I ask (as above) why it looks to the imaginary point \u03a5 (which sometimes precedes and sometimes follows the sun, here marked \u03a3, and is sometimes above and sometimes below it), rather than the sun's body itself? Or how it is that that power can have any perception whatever of the motion of \u03a5 around the earth K, since there is no body at \u03a8? Is it not more probable that the epicycle is restored to the lines \u039a\u03a3 of the sun\u2019s apparent position, when these pass through the center of the epicycle?\n Let us then see what is changed on the eccentric by substitution of the sun\u2019s apparent position. Again (as before) when the sun \u0393, the center of the sun\u2019s eccentric \u03a8, and the earth \u039a are on the same line, so that the line of the sun\u2019s apparent position \u03a8\u0393 and the line of its mean position \u039a\u0393 coincide, then for the center of the epicycle \u03a4 this place remains the same, whether its sidereal position is designated by \u039a\u03a4 or by \u03a8\u03a4, and the planet is really on the line \u039a\u03a4 or \u03a8\u03a4 and at the lowest point on its epicycle \u03a6, since here it is nearest to both \u03a8 and \u039a. The planet is thereby truly divested of its second inequality. But when the sun comes to the side of its eccentric (that is, to the middle distances), a great enough difference arises. For let the sun have gone from \u0393 to \u03a3, and the line of the sun\u2019s mean position \u039a\u03a5 be found in Aries, and the planet\u2019s line of vision \u039a\u03a9 precisely opposite in Libra, so that \u03a5\u039a\u03a9 is a single line. Now since  Ptolemy declared that the planet \u03a9 on this line of vision \u039a\u03a9 is divested of its second inequality, he places the center of the epicycle \u0396 on the line \u039a\u03a9. But since \u039a\u03a3 has gone beyond \u039a\u03a5, the sun\u2019s apparent position is beyond opposition to the planet. And in the last part of the time, \u039a\u03a9 is not descending, so as to be opposite \u039a\u03a3, but ascends towards \u039a\u03a6, because the lowest parts of the epicycle \u03a9 are retrograde and swifter than the center \u0396, and it is there, of course, that the planet is at opposition to the sun. Therefore, this apparent opposition precedes the mean one.\nTherefore, at some time preceding the moment designated by \u039a\u03a5 (let it be \u039a\u0398) when the sun is seen on the line \u039a\u039e, the planet will be seen opposite it (suppose it to be at \u0399) on \u039a\u0399 which forms a straight line with \u039a\u039e. Also, because it is now laid down that it sheds the second inequality at this true opposition, the center of the epicycle will also be seen on this line \u039e\u039a, say at \u039f. And because the planet is retrograde, at the time \u039a\u0398 prior to \u039a\u03a5 the planet is on the line \u039a\u0399 later than at \u039a\u03a9. But \u039a\u0399 and \u039a\u03a9 are parts of the lines \u039a\u039f and \u039a\u0396. Therefore, \u039a\u039f too is more to the east than \u039a\u0396.\nThus it is clear what would be changed on the line of the epicycle\u2019s center by this restoration from the sun\u2019s mean position to its apparent position. For at \u03a4 and the opposite point on the original line the motions of the epicycle\u2019s center remain unchanged. At \u0396 this line, and the center of the epicycle upon it, is moved forward and a subtraction is made from the intervening time. At the opposite place the contrary happens: an addition is made to the time, and the line of motion of the center of the epicycle is moved back westward. And thus these lines of the center of the epicycle differ much from the original lines. For this reason also, when we investigate the causes and measure of the first inequality by a new and repeated operation using these several observed positions of the center of the epicycle (that is, using the observed positions of the planet, after which we suppose the center of the epicycle to lie upon the same line), the outcome of this operation differs much from that of the preceding one. That is, since the time in the semicircle containing the apogee will have been diminished, so that the planet is correspondingly faster, the eccentricity of the equant will come out smaller. And since in the greater quadrant \u0392\u0396 of the semicircle containing the apogee the time will have been diminished by an amount equal to the diminution in the other, smaller part, the planet has been made proportionally much faster in the remaining part of the semicircle. Therefore, the perigee has come closer to the latter, and the apogee has descended from \u03a7 towards \u0396.\nThe quantification of the new hypothesis will be made clear thus. It is presupposed that the planet \u03a9 falls on the line drawn from the center of the epicycle \u0396 through the earth \u039a, only when \u039a\u0396 is collinear with \u039a\u03a3, the sun\u2019s apparent position. Therefore, \u039a\u03a3 and the line drawn from \u0396 through the body of the planet always proceed in parallel. Moreover, we have just taken it from Ptolemy that at the time when the line of the sun\u2019s mean position was \u039a\u03a5, drawn through \u03a9, the planet was observed on the line \u039a\u03a9, and nonetheless we do not grant him that the center of the epicycle \u0396 is on \u039a\u03a9 at the same time. Therefore, in accord with our position, let a line be drawn from the planet\u2019s position \u03a9 parallel to \u039a\u03a3, and let this be \u03a9\u039f. We are supposing that the center of the epicycle is at this moment on the line \u03a9\u039f, or some other line nearby and parallel, according as \u03a9 (representing the planet) is closer to or farther from \u039a on the line \u039a\u0396. Let \u03a9\u039f be drawn from whatever point on the line \u039a\u0396 (now, it is \u03a9), equal to \u03a9\u0396. From \u039f let a line be drawn to \u0396\u039a parallel to \u039a\u03a8, and let this be \u039f\u0396. Now since \u0396\u03a9\u039f is equal to \u039a\u03a3\u03a8, and \u039a\u03a3 is imperceptibly greater than \u03a8\u03a3  or \u03a9\u039f (because \u039a\u03a8\u03a3 is right, and the angle at \u03a3 is not greater than 2\u00b0 3\u2019, so that if \u03a8\u03a3 is 100,000, \u039a\u03a3 is 100,064), \u039f\u0396 is also imperceptibly less than \u039a\u03a8. Let \u0396\u0394 be joined, and let a line be drawn at \u039f parallel to \u0396\u0394. Now the moment of time at which the center of the epicycle is placed at \u0396 by Ptolemy and at \u039f by me, is the same, and is designated by both of us by the line \u039a\u03a5 in the theory of the sun. In the theory of Mars, that moment should be designated in the former theory by \u0396\u0394, because \u0394 is the point of equality, while in the new theory it will be designated by a line parallel to \u0396\u0394. Therefore, there will be a new point of equality, about which the time is counted, on this parallel through \u039f. ","671":"Now Ptolemy measured out the courses of the planets, not on the lines \u039a\u03a3, but on the lines \u039a\u03a5 drawn from \u039a parallel to the lines \u03a8\u03a3 passing through the sun\u2019s body.

But since \u039a\u03a3 has gone beyond \u039a\u03a5, the sun\u2019s apparent position is beyond opposition to the planet. And in the last part of the time, \u039a\u03a9 is not descending, so as to be opposite \u039a\u03a3, but ascends towards \u039a\u03a6, because the lowest parts of the epicycle \u03a9 are retrograde and swifter than the center \u0396, and it is there, of course, that the planet is at opposition to the sun.

We are supposing that the center of the epicycle is at this moment on the line \u03a9\u039f, or some other line nearby and parallel, according as \u03a9 (representing the planet) is closer to or farther from \u039a on the line \u039a\u0396. Let \u03a9\u039f be drawn from whatever point on the line \u039a\u0396 (now, it is \u03a9), equal to \u03a9\u0396. From \u039f let a line be drawn to \u0396\u039a parallel to \u039a\u03a8, and let this be \u039f\u0396. Now since \u0396\u03a9\u039f is equal to \u039a\u03a3\u03a8, and \u039a\u03a3 is imperceptibly greater than \u03a8\u03a3  or \u03a9\u039f (because \u039a\u03a8\u03a3 is right, and the angle at \u03a3 is not greater than 2\u00b0 3\u2019, so that if \u03a8\u03a3 is 100,000, \u039a\u03a3 is 100,064), \u039f\u0396 is also imperceptibly less than \u039a\u03a8. Let \u0396\u0394 be joined, and let a line be drawn at \u039f parallel to \u0396\u0394. Now the moment of time at which the center of the epicycle is placed at \u0396 by Ptolemy and at \u039f by me, is the same, and is designated by both of us by the line \u039a\u03a5 in the theory of the sun. In the theory of Mars, that moment should be designated in the former theory by \u0396\u0394, because \u0394 is the point of equality, while in the new theory it will be designated by a line parallel to \u0396\u0394. Therefore, there will be a new point of equality, about which the time is counted, on this parallel through \u039f.

For whenever the planet fell upon these lines \u039a\u03a5 on the side opposite the sun, it was supposed to have shed its second inequality, which fell to it (in Ptolemy\u2019s opinion) because of the epicycle. Then the planet\u2019s sidereal position was sought out by means of instruments, and the center of the epicycle was supposed to be found at that time on the same line.

Now suppose the treatment done, and let the eccentric's line of apsides come out to be \u039a\u039b\u0394\u03a7, with \u0394 the equalizing point, the center of the eccentric upon this line and at point \u039b, and the eccentric \u03a7\u0396. And let this hypothesis correspond to all positions observed at the times of the planet\u2019s opposition to the sun\u2019s mean position.\nHere, the objections I raised against Copernicus concerning the ordering of the physical motion are also not clearly in agreement with Ptolemy. For the center of the epicycle which accounts for the second inequality, here just as the planet itself previously, is borne slowly or swiftly according to its approach  to or recession from the earth \u039a, performed on the circle \u03a7\u0396. Furthermore, to stipulate that there is in the earth \u039a (just as there was before in Copernicus\u2019s sun, the heart of the world) a motive force that drives the centers of this kind of epicycle around, is absurd and monstrous. The hypothesis can also be discredited by another physical argument. For intrinsic to this form of hypothesis, in one way or another, is solidity of the orbs; and since this has been destroyed (by Tycho Brahe\u2019s observations of comets), the hypothesis appears, so to speak, to collapse under its own weight. For a moving force would be declared to reside in the center of the epicycle (not in a body, but in a mathematical point), and to rouse itself to move from place to place, by an unequal amount in equal times; but at the same time would draw the planet along with itself at the distance of the epicycle\u2019s diameter; all the while causing the planet to gyrate around itself, by equal amounts in equal times. That this enormous variety cannot fall to a single moving mind (unless it be God), Aristotle gives supporting arguments in the Metaphysics Book XII Ch. 8: he holds that the individual minds preside over individual, perfectly uniform and simple circular motions. Besides, how will some power sit in a non-body, and flow out of the non-body into the planet? Even if you divide up the tasks, and locate one motive intelligence at the center of the epicycle and another in the body of the planet, the one at the center will use the earth (a body, of course) as its reference, and will move around the earth nonuniformly in a circle, while the one at a point on the circumference (that is, in the planet's body) will move around an incorporeal center and do so uniformly. The question, then, is (as before), by what aids would it move around the incorporeal point? Not by geometrical imagination, for it does not admit of geometrical imagination of itself. Nor can a mobile point subsist in a non-body even in imagination. We humans, in imagining points of this sort, have recourse to the aids of tablets or paper, which we draw upon with our hands or at least remember ourselves to have drawn once. But it likewise cannot happen through a physical flowing of power (which is in the center of the epicycle) out to the circumference and the planet\u2019s body. For we have submitted to this outflow of power on the supposition that the tasks of the compound motions are divided between two minds. Why not also question whether in the first, eccentric motion, some natural force constituted to produce motion might subsist in some point entirely devoid of any body? And even more, whether this kind of incorporeal power can move itself around the earth, and go from place to place? And most of all, whether it can communicate or transfer another's motion through an efflux from itself, although it is not supported by any body that could serve as its nest? Those sublime considerations of the essence, motion, place, and operations of the blessed angels and of separate minds which some people will want to raise in opposition to me, are irrelevant. For we are arguing about natural things which are far inferior in dignity, about powers that exercise no choice of how to vary their action, and about minds which are not in the least separate, since they are yoked and bound to the celestial bodies which they are to bear. These, then, are the general objections that can be raised against  Ptolemy. \nBut something further may be said to Ptolemy, on account of which in particular he would wish to abandon his mean position of the sun and embrace the apparent with us. For if the power moving the planet (whether single or double) acts with respect to the sun, so that it places the planet at the lowest point of the epicycle whenever the center of the epicycle is opposite the sun, I ask (as above) why it looks to the imaginary point \u03a5 (which sometimes precedes and sometimes follows the sun, here marked \u03a3, and is sometimes above and sometimes below it), rather than the sun's body itself? Or how it is that that power can have any perception whatever of the motion of \u03a5 around the earth K, since there is no body at \u03a8? Is it not more probable that the epicycle is restored to the lines \u039a\u03a3 of the sun\u2019s apparent position, when these pass through the center of the epicycle?\n Let us then see what is changed on the eccentric by substitution of the sun\u2019s apparent position. Again (as before) when the sun \u0393, the center of the sun\u2019s eccentric \u03a8, and the earth \u039a are on the same line, so that the line of the sun\u2019s apparent position \u03a8\u0393 and the line of its mean position \u039a\u0393 coincide, then for the center of the epicycle \u03a4 this place remains the same, whether its sidereal position is designated by \u039a\u03a4 or by \u03a8\u03a4, and the planet is really on the line \u039a\u03a4 or \u03a8\u03a4 and at the lowest point on its epicycle \u03a6, since here it is nearest to both \u03a8 and \u039a. The planet is thereby truly divested of its second inequality. But when the sun comes to the side of its eccentric (that is, to the middle distances), a great enough difference arises. For let the sun have gone from \u0393 to \u03a3, and the line of the sun\u2019s mean position \u039a\u03a5 be found in Aries, and the planet\u2019s line of vision \u039a\u03a9 precisely opposite in Libra, so that \u03a5\u039a\u03a9 is a single line. Now since  Ptolemy declared that the planet \u03a9 on this line of vision \u039a\u03a9 is divested of its second inequality, he places the center of the epicycle \u0396 on the line \u039a\u03a9. But since \u039a\u03a3 has gone beyond \u039a\u03a5, the sun\u2019s apparent position is beyond opposition to the planet. And in the last part of the time, \u039a\u03a9 is not descending, so as to be opposite \u039a\u03a3, but ascends towards \u039a\u03a6, because the lowest parts of the epicycle \u03a9 are retrograde and swifter than the center \u0396, and it is there, of course, that the planet is at opposition to the sun. Therefore, this apparent opposition precedes the mean one.\nTherefore, at some time preceding the moment designated by \u039a\u03a5 (let it be \u039a\u0398) when the sun is seen on the line \u039a\u039e, the planet will be seen opposite it (suppose it to be at \u0399) on \u039a\u0399 which forms a straight line with \u039a\u039e. Also, because it is now laid down that it sheds the second inequality at this true opposition, the center of the epicycle will also be seen on this line \u039e\u039a, say at \u039f. And because the planet is retrograde, at the time \u039a\u0398 prior to \u039a\u03a5 the planet is on the line \u039a\u0399 later than at \u039a\u03a9. But \u039a\u0399 and \u039a\u03a9 are parts of the lines \u039a\u039f and \u039a\u0396. Therefore, \u039a\u039f too is more to the east than \u039a\u0396.\nThus it is clear what would be changed on the line of the epicycle\u2019s center by this restoration from the sun\u2019s mean position to its apparent position. For at \u03a4 and the opposite point on the original line the motions of the epicycle\u2019s center remain unchanged. At \u0396 this line, and the center of the epicycle upon it, is moved forward and a subtraction is made from the intervening time. At the opposite place the contrary happens: an addition is made to the time, and the line of motion of the center of the epicycle is moved back westward. And thus these lines of the center of the epicycle differ much from the original lines. For this reason also, when we investigate the causes and measure of the first inequality by a new and repeated operation using these several observed positions of the center of the epicycle (that is, using the observed positions of the planet, after which we suppose the center of the epicycle to lie upon the same line), the outcome of this operation differs much from that of the preceding one. That is, since the time in the semicircle containing the apogee will have been diminished, so that the planet is correspondingly faster, the eccentricity of the equant will come out smaller. And since in the greater quadrant \u0392\u0396 of the semicircle containing the apogee the time will have been diminished by an amount equal to the diminution in the other, smaller part, the planet has been made proportionally much faster in the remaining part of the semicircle. Therefore, the perigee has come closer to the latter, and the apogee has descended from \u03a7 towards \u0396.\nThe quantification of the new hypothesis will be made clear thus. It is presupposed that the planet \u03a9 falls on the line drawn from the center of the epicycle \u0396 through the earth \u039a, only when \u039a\u0396 is collinear with \u039a\u03a3, the sun\u2019s apparent position. Therefore, \u039a\u03a3 and the line drawn from \u0396 through the body of the planet always proceed in parallel. Moreover, we have just taken it from Ptolemy that at the time when the line of the sun\u2019s mean position was \u039a\u03a5, drawn through \u03a9, the planet was observed on the line \u039a\u03a9, and nonetheless we do not grant him that the center of the epicycle \u0396 is on \u039a\u03a9 at the same time. Therefore, in accord with our position, let a line be drawn from the planet\u2019s position \u03a9 parallel to \u039a\u03a3, and let this be \u03a9\u039f. We are supposing that the center of the epicycle is at this moment on the line \u03a9\u039f, or some other line nearby and parallel, according as \u03a9 (representing the planet) is closer to or farther from \u039a on the line \u039a\u0396. Let \u03a9\u039f be drawn from whatever point on the line \u039a\u0396 (now, it is \u03a9), equal to \u03a9\u0396. From \u039f let a line be drawn to \u0396\u039a parallel to \u039a\u03a8, and let this be \u039f\u0396. Now since \u0396\u03a9\u039f is equal to \u039a\u03a3\u03a8, and \u039a\u03a3 is imperceptibly greater than \u03a8\u03a3  or \u03a9\u039f (because \u039a\u03a8\u03a3 is right, and the angle at \u03a3 is not greater than 2\u00b0 3\u2019, so that if \u03a8\u03a3 is 100,000, \u039a\u03a3 is 100,064), \u039f\u0396 is also imperceptibly less than \u039a\u03a8. Let \u0396\u0394 be joined, and let a line be drawn at \u039f parallel to \u0396\u0394. Now the moment of time at which the center of the epicycle is placed at \u0396 by Ptolemy and at \u039f by me, is the same, and is designated by both of us by the line \u039a\u03a5 in the theory of the sun. In the theory of Mars, that moment should be designated in the former theory by \u0396\u0394, because \u0394 is the point of equality, while in the new theory it will be designated by a line parallel to \u0396\u0394. Therefore, there will be a new point of equality, about which the time is counted, on this parallel through \u039f. ","673":"Now Ptolemy measured out the courses of the planets, not on the lines \u039a\u03a3, but on the lines \u039a\u03a5 drawn from \u039a parallel to the lines \u03a8\u03a3 passing through the sun\u2019s body. For whenever the planet fell upon these lines \u039a\u03a5 on the side opposite the sun, it was supposed to have shed its second inequality, which fell to it (in Ptolemy\u2019s opinion) because of the epicycle. Then the planet\u2019s sidereal position was sought out by means of instruments, and the center of the epicycle was supposed to be found at that time on the same line. This was done a number of times and at various places on the zodiac: say, \u039a\u0393, \u039a\u03a5, and the points opposite. From three such positions of the planet (or of the center of the epicycle, which, according to Ptolemy, accounts for the second inequality), the practitioner sets out to investigate the hypothesis for the first inequality by comparing these angles which the observed positions form about \u039a, the center of the earth and of observation, with the intervening times.

But since \u039a\u03a3 has gone beyond \u039a\u03a5, the sun\u2019s apparent position is beyond opposition to the planet. And in the last part of the time, \u039a\u03a9 is not descending, so as to be opposite \u039a\u03a3, but ascends towards \u039a\u03a6, because the lowest parts of the epicycle \u03a9 are retrograde and swifter than the center \u0396, and it is there, of course, that the planet is at opposition to the sun.

Let \u03a9\u039f be drawn from whatever point on the line \u039a\u0396 (now, it is \u03a9), equal to \u03a9\u0396. From \u039f let a line be drawn to \u0396\u039a parallel to \u039a\u03a8, and let this be \u039f\u0396. Now since \u0396\u03a9\u039f is equal to \u039a\u03a3\u03a8, and \u039a\u03a3 is imperceptibly greater than \u03a8\u03a3  or \u03a9\u039f (because \u039a\u03a8\u03a3 is right, and the angle at \u03a3 is not greater than 2\u00b0 3\u2019, so that if \u03a8\u03a3 is 100,000, \u039a\u03a3 is 100,064), \u039f\u0396 is also imperceptibly less than \u039a\u03a8. Let \u0396\u0394 be joined, and let a line be drawn at \u039f parallel to \u0396\u0394.

For intrinsic to this form of hypothesis, in one way or another, is solidity of the orbs; and since this has been destroyed (by Tycho Brahe\u2019s observations of comets), the hypothesis appears, so to speak, to collapse under its own weight. For a moving force would be declared to reside in the center of the epicycle (not in a body, but in a mathematical point), and to rouse itself to move from place to place, by an unequal amount in equal times; but at the same time would draw the planet along with itself at the distance of the epicycle\u2019s diameter; all the while causing the planet to gyrate around itself, by equal amounts in equal times. That this enormous variety cannot fall to a single moving mind (unless it be God), Aristotle gives supporting arguments in the Metaphysics Book XII Ch. 8: he holds that the individual minds preside over individual, perfectly uniform and simple circular motions. Besides, how will some power sit in a non-body, and flow out of the non-body into the planet? Even if you divide up the tasks, and locate one motive intelligence at the center of the epicycle and another in the body of the planet, the one at the center will use the earth (a body, of course) as its reference, and will move around the earth nonuniformly in a circle, while the one at a point on the circumference (that is, in the planet's body) will move around an incorporeal center and do so uniformly. The question, then, is (as before), by what aids would it move around the incorporeal point? Not by geometrical imagination, for it does not admit of geometrical imagination of itself. Nor can a mobile point subsist in a non-body even in imagination. We humans, in imagining points of this sort, have recourse to the aids of tablets or paper, which we draw upon with our hands or at least remember ourselves to have drawn once. But it likewise cannot happen through a physical flowing of power (which is in the center of the epicycle) out to the circumference and the planet\u2019s body. For we have submitted to this outflow of power on the supposition that the tasks of the compound motions are divided between two minds. Why not also question whether in the first, eccentric motion, some natural force constituted to produce motion might subsist in some point entirely devoid of any body? And even more, whether this kind of incorporeal power can move itself around the earth, and go from place to place? And most of all, whether it can communicate or transfer another's motion through an efflux from itself, although it is not supported by any body that could serve as its nest? Those sublime considerations of the essence, motion, place, and operations of the blessed angels and of separate minds which some people will want to raise in opposition to me, are irrelevant. For we are arguing about natural things which are far inferior in dignity, about powers that exercise no choice of how to vary their action, and about minds which are not in the least separate, since they are yoked and bound to the celestial bodies which they are to bear. These, then, are the general objections that can be raised against  Ptolemy. \nBut something further may be said to Ptolemy, on account of which in particular he would wish to abandon his mean position of the sun and embrace the apparent with us. For if the power moving the planet (whether single or double) acts with respect to the sun, so that it places the planet at the lowest point of the epicycle whenever the center of the epicycle is opposite the sun, I ask (as above) why it looks to the imaginary point \u03a5 (which sometimes precedes and sometimes follows the sun, here marked \u03a3, and is sometimes above and sometimes below it), rather than the sun's body itself? Or how it is that that power can have any perception whatever of the motion of \u03a5 around the earth K, since there is no body at \u03a8? Is it not more probable that the epicycle is restored to the lines \u039a\u03a3 of the sun\u2019s apparent position, when these pass through the center of the epicycle?\n Let us then see what is changed on the eccentric by substitution of the sun\u2019s apparent position. Again (as before) when the sun \u0393, the center of the sun\u2019s eccentric \u03a8, and the earth \u039a are on the same line, so that the line of the sun\u2019s apparent position \u03a8\u0393 and the line of its mean position \u039a\u0393 coincide, then for the center of the epicycle \u03a4 this place remains the same, whether its sidereal position is designated by \u039a\u03a4 or by \u03a8\u03a4, and the planet is really on the line \u039a\u03a4 or \u03a8\u03a4 and at the lowest point on its epicycle \u03a6, since here it is nearest to both \u03a8 and \u039a. The planet is thereby truly divested of its second inequality. But when the sun comes to the side of its eccentric (that is, to the middle distances), a great enough difference arises. For let the sun have gone from \u0393 to \u03a3, and the line of the sun\u2019s mean position \u039a\u03a5 be found in Aries, and the planet\u2019s line of vision \u039a\u03a9 precisely opposite in Libra, so that \u03a5\u039a\u03a9 is a single line. Now since  Ptolemy declared that the planet \u03a9 on this line of vision \u039a\u03a9 is divested of its second inequality, he places the center of the epicycle \u0396 on the line \u039a\u03a9. But since \u039a\u03a3 has gone beyond \u039a\u03a5, the sun\u2019s apparent position is beyond opposition to the planet. And in the last part of the time, \u039a\u03a9 is not descending, so as to be opposite \u039a\u03a3, but ascends towards \u039a\u03a6, because the lowest parts of the epicycle \u03a9 are retrograde and swifter than the center \u0396, and it is there, of course, that the planet is at opposition to the sun. Therefore, this apparent opposition precedes the mean one.\nTherefore, at some time preceding the moment designated by \u039a\u03a5 (let it be \u039a\u0398) when the sun is seen on the line \u039a\u039e, the planet will be seen opposite it (suppose it to be at \u0399) on \u039a\u0399 which forms a straight line with \u039a\u039e. Also, because it is now laid down that it sheds the second inequality at this true opposition, the center of the epicycle will also be seen on this line \u039e\u039a, say at \u039f. And because the planet is retrograde, at the time \u039a\u0398 prior to \u039a\u03a5 the planet is on the line \u039a\u0399 later than at \u039a\u03a9. But \u039a\u0399 and \u039a\u03a9 are parts of the lines \u039a\u039f and \u039a\u0396. Therefore, \u039a\u039f too is more to the east than \u039a\u0396.\nThus it is clear what would be changed on the line of the epicycle\u2019s center by this restoration from the sun\u2019s mean position to its apparent position. For at \u03a4 and the opposite point on the original line the motions of the epicycle\u2019s center remain unchanged. At \u0396 this line, and the center of the epicycle upon it, is moved forward and a subtraction is made from the intervening time. At the opposite place the contrary happens: an addition is made to the time, and the line of motion of the center of the epicycle is moved back westward. And thus these lines of the center of the epicycle differ much from the original lines. For this reason also, when we investigate the causes and measure of the first inequality by a new and repeated operation using these several observed positions of the center of the epicycle (that is, using the observed positions of the planet, after which we suppose the center of the epicycle to lie upon the same line), the outcome of this operation differs much from that of the preceding one. That is, since the time in the semicircle containing the apogee will have been diminished, so that the planet is correspondingly faster, the eccentricity of the equant will come out smaller. And since in the greater quadrant \u0392\u0396 of the semicircle containing the apogee the time will have been diminished by an amount equal to the diminution in the other, smaller part, the planet has been made proportionally much faster in the remaining part of the semicircle. Therefore, the perigee has come closer to the latter, and the apogee has descended from \u03a7 towards \u0396.\nThe quantification of the new hypothesis will be made clear thus. It is presupposed that the planet \u03a9 falls on the line drawn from the center of the epicycle \u0396 through the earth \u039a, only when \u039a\u0396 is collinear with \u039a\u03a3, the sun\u2019s apparent position. Therefore, \u039a\u03a3 and the line drawn from \u0396 through the body of the planet always proceed in parallel. Moreover, we have just taken it from Ptolemy that at the time when the line of the sun\u2019s mean position was \u039a\u03a5, drawn through \u03a9, the planet was observed on the line \u039a\u03a9, and nonetheless we do not grant him that the center of the epicycle \u0396 is on \u039a\u03a9 at the same time. Therefore, in accord with our position, let a line be drawn from the planet\u2019s position \u03a9 parallel to \u039a\u03a3, and let this be \u03a9\u039f. We are supposing that the center of the epicycle is at this moment on the line \u03a9\u039f, or some other line nearby and parallel, according as \u03a9 (representing the planet) is closer to or farther from \u039a on the line \u039a\u0396. Let \u03a9\u039f be drawn from whatever point on the line \u039a\u0396 (now, it is \u03a9), equal to \u03a9\u0396. From \u039f let a line be drawn to \u0396\u039a parallel to \u039a\u03a8, and let this be \u039f\u0396. Now since \u0396\u03a9\u039f is equal to \u039a\u03a3\u03a8, and \u039a\u03a3 is imperceptibly greater than \u03a8\u03a3  or \u03a9\u039f (because \u039a\u03a8\u03a3 is right, and the angle at \u03a3 is not greater than 2\u00b0 3\u2019, so that if \u03a8\u03a3 is 100,000, \u039a\u03a3 is 100,064), \u039f\u0396 is also imperceptibly less than \u039a\u03a8. Let \u0396\u0394 be joined, and let a line be drawn at \u039f parallel to \u0396\u0394. Now the moment of time at which the center of the epicycle is placed at \u0396 by Ptolemy and at \u039f by me, is the same, and is designated by both of us by the line \u039a\u03a5 in the theory of the sun. In the theory of Mars, that moment should be designated in the former theory by \u0396\u0394, because \u0394 is the point of equality, while in the new theory it will be designated by a line parallel to \u0396\u0394. Therefore, there will be a new point of equality, about which the time is counted, on this parallel through \u039f. ","675":"Now Ptolemy measured out the courses of the planets, not on the lines \u039a\u03a3, but on the lines \u039a\u03a5 drawn from \u039a parallel to the lines \u03a8\u03a3 passing through the sun\u2019s body. For whenever the planet fell upon these lines \u039a\u03a5 on the side opposite the sun, it was supposed to have shed its second inequality, which fell to it (in Ptolemy\u2019s opinion) because of the epicycle. Then the planet\u2019s sidereal position was sought out by means of instruments, and the center of the epicycle was supposed to be found at that time on the same line. This was done a number of times and at various places on the zodiac: say, \u039a\u0393, \u039a\u03a5, and the points opposite. From three such positions of the planet (or of the center of the epicycle, which, according to Ptolemy, accounts for the second inequality), the practitioner sets out to investigate the hypothesis for the first inequality by comparing these angles which the observed positions form about \u039a, the center of the earth and of observation, with the intervening times. The method for this enterprise is found in Ptolemy Book IX ^19. Now suppose the treatment done, and let the eccentric's line of apsides come out to be \u039a\u039b\u0394\u03a7, with \u0394 the equalizing point, the center of the eccentric upon this line and at point \u039b, and the eccentric \u03a7\u0396. And let this hypothesis correspond to all positions observed at the times of the planet\u2019s opposition to the sun\u2019s mean position.\nHere, the objections I raised against Copernicus concerning the ordering of the physical motion are also not clearly in agreement with Ptolemy. For the center of the epicycle which accounts for the second inequality, here just as the planet itself previously, is borne slowly or swiftly according to its approach  to or recession from the earth \u039a, performed on the circle \u03a7\u0396. Furthermore, to stipulate that there is in the earth \u039a (just as there was before in Copernicus\u2019s sun, the heart of the world) a motive force that drives the centers of this kind of epicycle around, is absurd and monstrous.

But since \u039a\u03a3 has gone beyond \u039a\u03a5, the sun\u2019s apparent position is beyond opposition to the planet. And in the last part of the time, \u039a\u03a9 is not descending, so as to be opposite \u039a\u03a3, but ascends towards \u039a\u03a6, because the lowest parts of the epicycle \u03a9 are retrograde and swifter than the center \u0396, and it is there, of course, that the planet is at opposition to the sun.

But \u039a\u0399 and \u039a\u03a9 are parts of the lines \u039a\u039f and \u039a\u0396. Therefore, \u039a\u039f too is more to the east than \u039a\u0396.\nThus it is clear what would be changed on the line of the epicycle\u2019s center by this restoration from the sun\u2019s mean position to its apparent position.

Now since \u0396\u03a9\u039f is equal to \u039a\u03a3\u03a8, and \u039a\u03a3 is imperceptibly greater than \u03a8\u03a3  or \u03a9\u039f (because \u039a\u03a8\u03a3 is right, and the angle at \u03a3 is not greater than 2\u00b0 3\u2019, so that if \u03a8\u03a3 is 100,000, \u039a\u03a3 is 100,064), \u039f\u0396 is also imperceptibly less than \u039a\u03a8. Let \u0396\u0394 be joined, and let a line be drawn at \u039f parallel to \u0396\u0394.

Even if you divide up the tasks, and locate one motive intelligence at the center of the epicycle and another in the body of the planet, the one at the center will use the earth (a body, of course) as its reference, and will move around the earth nonuniformly in a circle, while the one at a point on the circumference (that is, in the planet's body) will move around an incorporeal center and do so uniformly. The question, then, is (as before), by what aids would it move around the incorporeal point? Not by geometrical imagination, for it does not admit of geometrical imagination of itself. Nor can a mobile point subsist in a non-body even in imagination. We humans, in imagining points of this sort, have recourse to the aids of tablets or paper, which we draw upon with our hands or at least remember ourselves to have drawn once. But it likewise cannot happen through a physical flowing of power (which is in the center of the epicycle) out to the circumference and the planet\u2019s body. For we have submitted to this outflow of power on the supposition that the tasks of the compound motions are divided between two minds. Why not also question whether in the first, eccentric motion, some natural force constituted to produce motion might subsist in some point entirely devoid of any body? And even more, whether this kind of incorporeal power can move itself around the earth, and go from place to place? And most of all, whether it can communicate or transfer another's motion through an efflux from itself, although it is not supported by any body that could serve as its nest? Those sublime considerations of the essence, motion, place, and operations of the blessed angels and of separate minds which some people will want to raise in opposition to me, are irrelevant. For we are arguing about natural things which are far inferior in dignity, about powers that exercise no choice of how to vary their action, and about minds which are not in the least separate, since they are yoked and bound to the celestial bodies which they are to bear. These, then, are the general objections that can be raised against  Ptolemy. \nBut something further may be said to Ptolemy, on account of which in particular he would wish to abandon his mean position of the sun and embrace the apparent with us. For if the power moving the planet (whether single or double) acts with respect to the sun, so that it places the planet at the lowest point of the epicycle whenever the center of the epicycle is opposite the sun, I ask (as above) why it looks to the imaginary point \u03a5 (which sometimes precedes and sometimes follows the sun, here marked \u03a3, and is sometimes above and sometimes below it), rather than the sun's body itself? Or how it is that that power can have any perception whatever of the motion of \u03a5 around the earth K, since there is no body at \u03a8? Is it not more probable that the epicycle is restored to the lines \u039a\u03a3 of the sun\u2019s apparent position, when these pass through the center of the epicycle?\n Let us then see what is changed on the eccentric by substitution of the sun\u2019s apparent position. Again (as before) when the sun \u0393, the center of the sun\u2019s eccentric \u03a8, and the earth \u039a are on the same line, so that the line of the sun\u2019s apparent position \u03a8\u0393 and the line of its mean position \u039a\u0393 coincide, then for the center of the epicycle \u03a4 this place remains the same, whether its sidereal position is designated by \u039a\u03a4 or by \u03a8\u03a4, and the planet is really on the line \u039a\u03a4 or \u03a8\u03a4 and at the lowest point on its epicycle \u03a6, since here it is nearest to both \u03a8 and \u039a. The planet is thereby truly divested of its second inequality. But when the sun comes to the side of its eccentric (that is, to the middle distances), a great enough difference arises. For let the sun have gone from \u0393 to \u03a3, and the line of the sun\u2019s mean position \u039a\u03a5 be found in Aries, and the planet\u2019s line of vision \u039a\u03a9 precisely opposite in Libra, so that \u03a5\u039a\u03a9 is a single line. Now since  Ptolemy declared that the planet \u03a9 on this line of vision \u039a\u03a9 is divested of its second inequality, he places the center of the epicycle \u0396 on the line \u039a\u03a9. But since \u039a\u03a3 has gone beyond \u039a\u03a5, the sun\u2019s apparent position is beyond opposition to the planet. And in the last part of the time, \u039a\u03a9 is not descending, so as to be opposite \u039a\u03a3, but ascends towards \u039a\u03a6, because the lowest parts of the epicycle \u03a9 are retrograde and swifter than the center \u0396, and it is there, of course, that the planet is at opposition to the sun. Therefore, this apparent opposition precedes the mean one.\nTherefore, at some time preceding the moment designated by \u039a\u03a5 (let it be \u039a\u0398) when the sun is seen on the line \u039a\u039e, the planet will be seen opposite it (suppose it to be at \u0399) on \u039a\u0399 which forms a straight line with \u039a\u039e. Also, because it is now laid down that it sheds the second inequality at this true opposition, the center of the epicycle will also be seen on this line \u039e\u039a, say at \u039f. And because the planet is retrograde, at the time \u039a\u0398 prior to \u039a\u03a5 the planet is on the line \u039a\u0399 later than at \u039a\u03a9. But \u039a\u0399 and \u039a\u03a9 are parts of the lines \u039a\u039f and \u039a\u0396. Therefore, \u039a\u039f too is more to the east than \u039a\u0396.\nThus it is clear what would be changed on the line of the epicycle\u2019s center by this restoration from the sun\u2019s mean position to its apparent position. For at \u03a4 and the opposite point on the original line the motions of the epicycle\u2019s center remain unchanged. At \u0396 this line, and the center of the epicycle upon it, is moved forward and a subtraction is made from the intervening time. At the opposite place the contrary happens: an addition is made to the time, and the line of motion of the center of the epicycle is moved back westward. And thus these lines of the center of the epicycle differ much from the original lines. For this reason also, when we investigate the causes and measure of the first inequality by a new and repeated operation using these several observed positions of the center of the epicycle (that is, using the observed positions of the planet, after which we suppose the center of the epicycle to lie upon the same line), the outcome of this operation differs much from that of the preceding one. That is, since the time in the semicircle containing the apogee will have been diminished, so that the planet is correspondingly faster, the eccentricity of the equant will come out smaller. And since in the greater quadrant \u0392\u0396 of the semicircle containing the apogee the time will have been diminished by an amount equal to the diminution in the other, smaller part, the planet has been made proportionally much faster in the remaining part of the semicircle. Therefore, the perigee has come closer to the latter, and the apogee has descended from \u03a7 towards \u0396.\nThe quantification of the new hypothesis will be made clear thus. It is presupposed that the planet \u03a9 falls on the line drawn from the center of the epicycle \u0396 through the earth \u039a, only when \u039a\u0396 is collinear with \u039a\u03a3, the sun\u2019s apparent position. Therefore, \u039a\u03a3 and the line drawn from \u0396 through the body of the planet always proceed in parallel. Moreover, we have just taken it from Ptolemy that at the time when the line of the sun\u2019s mean position was \u039a\u03a5, drawn through \u03a9, the planet was observed on the line \u039a\u03a9, and nonetheless we do not grant him that the center of the epicycle \u0396 is on \u039a\u03a9 at the same time. Therefore, in accord with our position, let a line be drawn from the planet\u2019s position \u03a9 parallel to \u039a\u03a3, and let this be \u03a9\u039f. We are supposing that the center of the epicycle is at this moment on the line \u03a9\u039f, or some other line nearby and parallel, according as \u03a9 (representing the planet) is closer to or farther from \u039a on the line \u039a\u0396. Let \u03a9\u039f be drawn from whatever point on the line \u039a\u0396 (now, it is \u03a9), equal to \u03a9\u0396. From \u039f let a line be drawn to \u0396\u039a parallel to \u039a\u03a8, and let this be \u039f\u0396. Now since \u0396\u03a9\u039f is equal to \u039a\u03a3\u03a8, and \u039a\u03a3 is imperceptibly greater than \u03a8\u03a3  or \u03a9\u039f (because \u039a\u03a8\u03a3 is right, and the angle at \u03a3 is not greater than 2\u00b0 3\u2019, so that if \u03a8\u03a3 is 100,000, \u039a\u03a3 is 100,064), \u039f\u0396 is also imperceptibly less than \u039a\u03a8. Let \u0396\u0394 be joined, and let a line be drawn at \u039f parallel to \u0396\u0394. Now the moment of time at which the center of the epicycle is placed at \u0396 by Ptolemy and at \u039f by me, is the same, and is designated by both of us by the line \u039a\u03a5 in the theory of the sun. In the theory of Mars, that moment should be designated in the former theory by \u0396\u0394, because \u0394 is the point of equality, while in the new theory it will be designated by a line parallel to \u0396\u0394. Therefore, there will be a new point of equality, about which the time is counted, on this parallel through \u039f. ","677":"Now Ptolemy measured out the courses of the planets, not on the lines \u039a\u03a3, but on the lines \u039a\u03a5 drawn from \u039a parallel to the lines \u03a8\u03a3 passing through the sun\u2019s body. For whenever the planet fell upon these lines \u039a\u03a5 on the side opposite the sun, it was supposed to have shed its second inequality, which fell to it (in Ptolemy\u2019s opinion) because of the epicycle. Then the planet\u2019s sidereal position was sought out by means of instruments, and the center of the epicycle was supposed to be found at that time on the same line. This was done a number of times and at various places on the zodiac: say, \u039a\u0393, \u039a\u03a5, and the points opposite. From three such positions of the planet (or of the center of the epicycle, which, according to Ptolemy, accounts for the second inequality), the practitioner sets out to investigate the hypothesis for the first inequality by comparing these angles which the observed positions form about \u039a, the center of the earth and of observation, with the intervening times. The method for this enterprise is found in Ptolemy Book IX ^19. Now suppose the treatment done, and let the eccentric's line of apsides come out to be \u039a\u039b\u0394\u03a7, with \u0394 the equalizing point, the center of the eccentric upon this line and at point \u039b, and the eccentric \u03a7\u0396. And let this hypothesis correspond to all positions observed at the times of the planet\u2019s opposition to the sun\u2019s mean position.\nHere, the objections I raised against Copernicus concerning the ordering of the physical motion are also not clearly in agreement with Ptolemy. For the center of the epicycle which accounts for the second inequality, here just as the planet itself previously, is borne slowly or swiftly according to its approach  to or recession from the earth \u039a, performed on the circle \u03a7\u0396. Furthermore, to stipulate that there is in the earth \u039a (just as there was before in Copernicus\u2019s sun, the heart of the world) a motive force that drives the centers of this kind of epicycle around, is absurd and monstrous. The hypothesis can also be discredited by another physical argument. For intrinsic to this form of hypothesis, in one way or another, is solidity of the orbs; and since this has been destroyed (by Tycho Brahe\u2019s observations of comets), the hypothesis appears, so to speak, to collapse under its own weight. For a moving force would be declared to reside in the center of the epicycle (not in a body, but in a mathematical point), and to rouse itself to move from place to place, by an unequal amount in equal times; but at the same time would draw the planet along with itself at the distance of the epicycle\u2019s diameter; all the while causing the planet to gyrate around itself, by equal amounts in equal times. That this enormous variety cannot fall to a single moving mind (unless it be God), Aristotle gives supporting arguments in the Metaphysics Book XII Ch. 8: he holds that the individual minds preside over individual, perfectly uniform and simple circular motions. Besides, how will some power sit in a non-body, and flow out of the non-body into the planet?

But since \u039a\u03a3 has gone beyond \u039a\u03a5, the sun\u2019s apparent position is beyond opposition to the planet. And in the last part of the time, \u039a\u03a9 is not descending, so as to be opposite \u039a\u03a3, but ascends towards \u039a\u03a6, because the lowest parts of the epicycle \u03a9 are retrograde and swifter than the center \u0396, and it is there, of course, that the planet is at opposition to the sun. Therefore, this apparent opposition precedes the mean one.\nTherefore, at some time preceding the moment designated by \u039a\u03a5 (let it be \u039a\u0398) when the sun is seen on the line \u039a\u039e, the planet will be seen opposite it (suppose it to be at \u0399) on \u039a\u0399 which forms a straight line with \u039a\u039e. Also, because it is now laid down that it sheds the second inequality at this true opposition, the center of the epicycle will also be seen on this line \u039e\u039a, say at \u039f. And because the planet is retrograde, at the time \u039a\u0398 prior to \u039a\u03a5 the planet is on the line \u039a\u0399 later than at \u039a\u03a9. But \u039a\u0399 and \u039a\u03a9 are parts of the lines \u039a\u039f and \u039a\u0396. Therefore, \u039a\u039f too is more to the east than \u039a\u0396.\nThus it is clear what would be changed on the line of the epicycle\u2019s center by this restoration from the sun\u2019s mean position to its apparent position. For at \u03a4 and the opposite point on the original line the motions of the epicycle\u2019s center remain unchanged. At \u0396 this line, and the center of the epicycle upon it, is moved forward and a subtraction is made from the intervening time.

Let \u03a9\u039f be drawn from whatever point on the line \u039a\u0396 (now, it is \u03a9), equal to \u03a9\u0396. From \u039f let a line be drawn to \u0396\u039a parallel to \u039a\u03a8, and let this be \u039f\u0396. Now since \u0396\u03a9\u039f is equal to \u039a\u03a3\u03a8, and \u039a\u03a3 is imperceptibly greater than \u03a8\u03a3  or \u03a9\u039f (because \u039a\u03a8\u03a3 is right, and the angle at \u03a3 is not greater than 2\u00b0 3\u2019, so that if \u03a8\u03a3 is 100,000, \u039a\u03a3 is 100,064), \u039f\u0396 is also imperceptibly less than \u039a\u03a8. Let \u0396\u0394 be joined, and let a line be drawn at \u039f parallel to \u0396\u0394.

And most of all, whether it can communicate or transfer another's motion through an efflux from itself, although it is not supported by any body that could serve as its nest? Those sublime considerations of the essence, motion, place, and operations of the blessed angels and of separate minds which some people will want to raise in opposition to me, are irrelevant. For we are arguing about natural things which are far inferior in dignity, about powers that exercise no choice of how to vary their action, and about minds which are not in the least separate, since they are yoked and bound to the celestial bodies which they are to bear. These, then, are the general objections that can be raised against  Ptolemy. \nBut something further may be said to Ptolemy, on account of which in particular he would wish to abandon his mean position of the sun and embrace the apparent with us. For if the power moving the planet (whether single or double) acts with respect to the sun, so that it places the planet at the lowest point of the epicycle whenever the center of the epicycle is opposite the sun, I ask (as above) why it looks to the imaginary point \u03a5 (which sometimes precedes and sometimes follows the sun, here marked \u03a3, and is sometimes above and sometimes below it), rather than the sun's body itself? Or how it is that that power can have any perception whatever of the motion of \u03a5 around the earth K, since there is no body at \u03a8? Is it not more probable that the epicycle is restored to the lines \u039a\u03a3 of the sun\u2019s apparent position, when these pass through the center of the epicycle?\n Let us then see what is changed on the eccentric by substitution of the sun\u2019s apparent position. Again (as before) when the sun \u0393, the center of the sun\u2019s eccentric \u03a8, and the earth \u039a are on the same line, so that the line of the sun\u2019s apparent position \u03a8\u0393 and the line of its mean position \u039a\u0393 coincide, then for the center of the epicycle \u03a4 this place remains the same, whether its sidereal position is designated by \u039a\u03a4 or by \u03a8\u03a4, and the planet is really on the line \u039a\u03a4 or \u03a8\u03a4 and at the lowest point on its epicycle \u03a6, since here it is nearest to both \u03a8 and \u039a. The planet is thereby truly divested of its second inequality. But when the sun comes to the side of its eccentric (that is, to the middle distances), a great enough difference arises. For let the sun have gone from \u0393 to \u03a3, and the line of the sun\u2019s mean position \u039a\u03a5 be found in Aries, and the planet\u2019s line of vision \u039a\u03a9 precisely opposite in Libra, so that \u03a5\u039a\u03a9 is a single line. Now since  Ptolemy declared that the planet \u03a9 on this line of vision \u039a\u03a9 is divested of its second inequality, he places the center of the epicycle \u0396 on the line \u039a\u03a9. But since \u039a\u03a3 has gone beyond \u039a\u03a5, the sun\u2019s apparent position is beyond opposition to the planet. And in the last part of the time, \u039a\u03a9 is not descending, so as to be opposite \u039a\u03a3, but ascends towards \u039a\u03a6, because the lowest parts of the epicycle \u03a9 are retrograde and swifter than the center \u0396, and it is there, of course, that the planet is at opposition to the sun. Therefore, this apparent opposition precedes the mean one.\nTherefore, at some time preceding the moment designated by \u039a\u03a5 (let it be \u039a\u0398) when the sun is seen on the line \u039a\u039e, the planet will be seen opposite it (suppose it to be at \u0399) on \u039a\u0399 which forms a straight line with \u039a\u039e. Also, because it is now laid down that it sheds the second inequality at this true opposition, the center of the epicycle will also be seen on this line \u039e\u039a, say at \u039f. And because the planet is retrograde, at the time \u039a\u0398 prior to \u039a\u03a5 the planet is on the line \u039a\u0399 later than at \u039a\u03a9. But \u039a\u0399 and \u039a\u03a9 are parts of the lines \u039a\u039f and \u039a\u0396. Therefore, \u039a\u039f too is more to the east than \u039a\u0396.\nThus it is clear what would be changed on the line of the epicycle\u2019s center by this restoration from the sun\u2019s mean position to its apparent position. For at \u03a4 and the opposite point on the original line the motions of the epicycle\u2019s center remain unchanged. At \u0396 this line, and the center of the epicycle upon it, is moved forward and a subtraction is made from the intervening time. At the opposite place the contrary happens: an addition is made to the time, and the line of motion of the center of the epicycle is moved back westward. And thus these lines of the center of the epicycle differ much from the original lines. For this reason also, when we investigate the causes and measure of the first inequality by a new and repeated operation using these several observed positions of the center of the epicycle (that is, using the observed positions of the planet, after which we suppose the center of the epicycle to lie upon the same line), the outcome of this operation differs much from that of the preceding one. That is, since the time in the semicircle containing the apogee will have been diminished, so that the planet is correspondingly faster, the eccentricity of the equant will come out smaller. And since in the greater quadrant \u0392\u0396 of the semicircle containing the apogee the time will have been diminished by an amount equal to the diminution in the other, smaller part, the planet has been made proportionally much faster in the remaining part of the semicircle. Therefore, the perigee has come closer to the latter, and the apogee has descended from \u03a7 towards \u0396.\nThe quantification of the new hypothesis will be made clear thus. It is presupposed that the planet \u03a9 falls on the line drawn from the center of the epicycle \u0396 through the earth \u039a, only when \u039a\u0396 is collinear with \u039a\u03a3, the sun\u2019s apparent position. Therefore, \u039a\u03a3 and the line drawn from \u0396 through the body of the planet always proceed in parallel. Moreover, we have just taken it from Ptolemy that at the time when the line of the sun\u2019s mean position was \u039a\u03a5, drawn through \u03a9, the planet was observed on the line \u039a\u03a9, and nonetheless we do not grant him that the center of the epicycle \u0396 is on \u039a\u03a9 at the same time. Therefore, in accord with our position, let a line be drawn from the planet\u2019s position \u03a9 parallel to \u039a\u03a3, and let this be \u03a9\u039f. We are supposing that the center of the epicycle is at this moment on the line \u03a9\u039f, or some other line nearby and parallel, according as \u03a9 (representing the planet) is closer to or farther from \u039a on the line \u039a\u0396. Let \u03a9\u039f be drawn from whatever point on the line \u039a\u0396 (now, it is \u03a9), equal to \u03a9\u0396. From \u039f let a line be drawn to \u0396\u039a parallel to \u039a\u03a8, and let this be \u039f\u0396. Now since \u0396\u03a9\u039f is equal to \u039a\u03a3\u03a8, and \u039a\u03a3 is imperceptibly greater than \u03a8\u03a3  or \u03a9\u039f (because \u039a\u03a8\u03a3 is right, and the angle at \u03a3 is not greater than 2\u00b0 3\u2019, so that if \u03a8\u03a3 is 100,000, \u039a\u03a3 is 100,064), \u039f\u0396 is also imperceptibly less than \u039a\u03a8. Let \u0396\u0394 be joined, and let a line be drawn at \u039f parallel to \u0396\u0394. Now the moment of time at which the center of the epicycle is placed at \u0396 by Ptolemy and at \u039f by me, is the same, and is designated by both of us by the line \u039a\u03a5 in the theory of the sun. In the theory of Mars, that moment should be designated in the former theory by \u0396\u0394, because \u0394 is the point of equality, while in the new theory it will be designated by a line parallel to \u0396\u0394. Therefore, there will be a new point of equality, about which the time is counted, on this parallel through \u039f. ","679":"Now Ptolemy measured out the courses of the planets, not on the lines \u039a\u03a3, but on the lines \u039a\u03a5 drawn from \u039a parallel to the lines \u03a8\u03a3 passing through the sun\u2019s body. For whenever the planet fell upon these lines \u039a\u03a5 on the side opposite the sun, it was supposed to have shed its second inequality, which fell to it (in Ptolemy\u2019s opinion) because of the epicycle. Then the planet\u2019s sidereal position was sought out by means of instruments, and the center of the epicycle was supposed to be found at that time on the same line. This was done a number of times and at various places on the zodiac: say, \u039a\u0393, \u039a\u03a5, and the points opposite. From three such positions of the planet (or of the center of the epicycle, which, according to Ptolemy, accounts for the second inequality), the practitioner sets out to investigate the hypothesis for the first inequality by comparing these angles which the observed positions form about \u039a, the center of the earth and of observation, with the intervening times. The method for this enterprise is found in Ptolemy Book IX ^19. Now suppose the treatment done, and let the eccentric's line of apsides come out to be \u039a\u039b\u0394\u03a7, with \u0394 the equalizing point, the center of the eccentric upon this line and at point \u039b, and the eccentric \u03a7\u0396. And let this hypothesis correspond to all positions observed at the times of the planet\u2019s opposition to the sun\u2019s mean position.\nHere, the objections I raised against Copernicus concerning the ordering of the physical motion are also not clearly in agreement with Ptolemy. For the center of the epicycle which accounts for the second inequality, here just as the planet itself previously, is borne slowly or swiftly according to its approach  to or recession from the earth \u039a, performed on the circle \u03a7\u0396. Furthermore, to stipulate that there is in the earth \u039a (just as there was before in Copernicus\u2019s sun, the heart of the world) a motive force that drives the centers of this kind of epicycle around, is absurd and monstrous. The hypothesis can also be discredited by another physical argument. For intrinsic to this form of hypothesis, in one way or another, is solidity of the orbs; and since this has been destroyed (by Tycho Brahe\u2019s observations of comets), the hypothesis appears, so to speak, to collapse under its own weight. For a moving force would be declared to reside in the center of the epicycle (not in a body, but in a mathematical point), and to rouse itself to move from place to place, by an unequal amount in equal times; but at the same time would draw the planet along with itself at the distance of the epicycle\u2019s diameter; all the while causing the planet to gyrate around itself, by equal amounts in equal times. That this enormous variety cannot fall to a single moving mind (unless it be God), Aristotle gives supporting arguments in the Metaphysics Book XII Ch. 8: he holds that the individual minds preside over individual, perfectly uniform and simple circular motions. Besides, how will some power sit in a non-body, and flow out of the non-body into the planet? Even if you divide up the tasks, and locate one motive intelligence at the center of the epicycle and another in the body of the planet, the one at the center will use the earth (a body, of course) as its reference, and will move around the earth nonuniformly in a circle, while the one at a point on the circumference (that is, in the planet's body) will move around an incorporeal center and do so uniformly. The question, then, is (as before), by what aids would it move around the incorporeal point? Not by geometrical imagination, for it does not admit of geometrical imagination of itself. Nor can a mobile point subsist in a non-body even in imagination. We humans, in imagining points of this sort, have recourse to the aids of tablets or paper, which we draw upon with our hands or at least remember ourselves to have drawn once. But it likewise cannot happen through a physical flowing of power (which is in the center of the epicycle) out to the circumference and the planet\u2019s body. For we have submitted to this outflow of power on the supposition that the tasks of the compound motions are divided between two minds. Why not also question whether in the first, eccentric motion, some natural force constituted to produce motion might subsist in some point entirely devoid of any body? And even more, whether this kind of incorporeal power can move itself around the earth, and go from place to place? And most of all, whether it can communicate or transfer another's motion through an efflux from itself, although it is not supported by any body that could serve as its nest?

Is it not more probable that the epicycle is restored to the lines \u039a\u03a3 of the sun\u2019s apparent position, when these pass through the center of the epicycle?\n Let us then see what is changed on the eccentric by substitution of the sun\u2019s apparent position.

The planet is thereby truly divested of its second inequality. But when the sun comes to the side of its eccentric (that is, to the middle distances), a great enough difference arises.

Now since  Ptolemy declared that the planet \u03a9 on this line of vision \u039a\u03a9 is divested of its second inequality, he places the center of the epicycle \u0396 on the line \u039a\u03a9. But since \u039a\u03a3 has gone beyond \u039a\u03a5, the sun\u2019s apparent position is beyond opposition to the planet. And in the last part of the time, \u039a\u03a9 is not descending, so as to be opposite \u039a\u03a3, but ascends towards \u039a\u03a6, because the lowest parts of the epicycle \u03a9 are retrograde and swifter than the center \u0396, and it is there, of course, that the planet is at opposition to the sun. Therefore, this apparent opposition precedes the mean one.\nTherefore, at some time preceding the moment designated by \u039a\u03a5 (let it be \u039a\u0398) when the sun is seen on the line \u039a\u039e, the planet will be seen opposite it (suppose it to be at \u0399) on \u039a\u0399 which forms a straight line with \u039a\u039e. Also, because it is now laid down that it sheds the second inequality at this true opposition, the center of the epicycle will also be seen on this line \u039e\u039a, say at \u039f. And because the planet is retrograde, at the time \u039a\u0398 prior to \u039a\u03a5 the planet is on the line \u039a\u0399 later than at \u039a\u03a9. But \u039a\u0399 and \u039a\u03a9 are parts of the lines \u039a\u039f and \u039a\u0396. Therefore, \u039a\u039f too is more to the east than \u039a\u0396.\nThus it is clear what would be changed on the line of the epicycle\u2019s center by this restoration from the sun\u2019s mean position to its apparent position. For at \u03a4 and the opposite point on the original line the motions of the epicycle\u2019s center remain unchanged.

Let \u03a9\u039f be drawn from whatever point on the line \u039a\u0396 (now, it is \u03a9), equal to \u03a9\u0396. From \u039f let a line be drawn to \u0396\u039a parallel to \u039a\u03a8, and let this be \u039f\u0396. Now since \u0396\u03a9\u039f is equal to \u039a\u03a3\u03a8, and \u039a\u03a3 is imperceptibly greater than \u03a8\u03a3  or \u03a9\u039f (because \u039a\u03a8\u03a3 is right, and the angle at \u03a3 is not greater than 2\u00b0 3\u2019, so that if \u03a8\u03a3 is 100,000, \u039a\u03a3 is 100,064), \u039f\u0396 is also imperceptibly less than \u039a\u03a8. Let \u0396\u0394 be joined, and let a line be drawn at \u039f parallel to \u0396\u0394.

Is it not more probable that the epicycle is restored to the lines \u039a\u03a3 of the sun\u2019s apparent position, when these pass through the center of the epicycle?\n Let us then see what is changed on the eccentric by substitution of the sun\u2019s apparent position. Again (as before) when the sun \u0393, the center of the sun\u2019s eccentric \u03a8, and the earth \u039a are on the same line, so that the line of the sun\u2019s apparent position \u03a8\u0393 and the line of its mean position \u039a\u0393 coincide, then for the center of the epicycle \u03a4 this place remains the same, whether its sidereal position is designated by \u039a\u03a4 or by \u03a8\u03a4, and the planet is really on the line \u039a\u03a4 or \u03a8\u03a4 and at the lowest point on its epicycle \u03a6, since here it is nearest to both \u03a8 and \u039a. The planet is thereby truly divested of its second inequality. But when the sun comes to the side of its eccentric (that is, to the middle distances), a great enough difference arises. For let the sun have gone from \u0393 to \u03a3, and the line of the sun\u2019s mean position \u039a\u03a5 be found in Aries, and the planet\u2019s line of vision \u039a\u03a9 precisely opposite in Libra, so that \u03a5\u039a\u03a9 is a single line. Now since  Ptolemy declared that the planet \u03a9 on this line of vision \u039a\u03a9 is divested of its second inequality, he places the center of the epicycle \u0396 on the line \u039a\u03a9. But since \u039a\u03a3 has gone beyond \u039a\u03a5, the sun\u2019s apparent position is beyond opposition to the planet. And in the last part of the time, \u039a\u03a9 is not descending, so as to be opposite \u039a\u03a3, but ascends towards \u039a\u03a6, because the lowest parts of the epicycle \u03a9 are retrograde and swifter than the center \u0396, and it is there, of course, that the planet is at opposition to the sun. Therefore, this apparent opposition precedes the mean one.\nTherefore, at some time preceding the moment designated by \u039a\u03a5 (let it be \u039a\u0398) when the sun is seen on the line \u039a\u039e, the planet will be seen opposite it (suppose it to be at \u0399) on \u039a\u0399 which forms a straight line with \u039a\u039e. Also, because it is now laid down that it sheds the second inequality at this true opposition, the center of the epicycle will also be seen on this line \u039e\u039a, say at \u039f. And because the planet is retrograde, at the time \u039a\u0398 prior to \u039a\u03a5 the planet is on the line \u039a\u0399 later than at \u039a\u03a9. But \u039a\u0399 and \u039a\u03a9 are parts of the lines \u039a\u039f and \u039a\u0396. Therefore, \u039a\u039f too is more to the east than \u039a\u0396.\nThus it is clear what would be changed on the line of the epicycle\u2019s center by this restoration from the sun\u2019s mean position to its apparent position. For at \u03a4 and the opposite point on the original line the motions of the epicycle\u2019s center remain unchanged. At \u0396 this line, and the center of the epicycle upon it, is moved forward and a subtraction is made from the intervening time. At the opposite place the contrary happens: an addition is made to the time, and the line of motion of the center of the epicycle is moved back westward. And thus these lines of the center of the epicycle differ much from the original lines. For this reason also, when we investigate the causes and measure of the first inequality by a new and repeated operation using these several observed positions of the center of the epicycle (that is, using the observed positions of the planet, after which we suppose the center of the epicycle to lie upon the same line), the outcome of this operation differs much from that of the preceding one. That is, since the time in the semicircle containing the apogee will have been diminished, so that the planet is correspondingly faster, the eccentricity of the equant will come out smaller. And since in the greater quadrant \u0392\u0396 of the semicircle containing the apogee the time will have been diminished by an amount equal to the diminution in the other, smaller part, the planet has been made proportionally much faster in the remaining part of the semicircle. Therefore, the perigee has come closer to the latter, and the apogee has descended from \u03a7 towards \u0396.\nThe quantification of the new hypothesis will be made clear thus. It is presupposed that the planet \u03a9 falls on the line drawn from the center of the epicycle \u0396 through the earth \u039a, only when \u039a\u0396 is collinear with \u039a\u03a3, the sun\u2019s apparent position. Therefore, \u039a\u03a3 and the line drawn from \u0396 through the body of the planet always proceed in parallel. Moreover, we have just taken it from Ptolemy that at the time when the line of the sun\u2019s mean position was \u039a\u03a5, drawn through \u03a9, the planet was observed on the line \u039a\u03a9, and nonetheless we do not grant him that the center of the epicycle \u0396 is on \u039a\u03a9 at the same time. Therefore, in accord with our position, let a line be drawn from the planet\u2019s position \u03a9 parallel to \u039a\u03a3, and let this be \u03a9\u039f. We are supposing that the center of the epicycle is at this moment on the line \u03a9\u039f, or some other line nearby and parallel, according as \u03a9 (representing the planet) is closer to or farther from \u039a on the line \u039a\u0396. Let \u03a9\u039f be drawn from whatever point on the line \u039a\u0396 (now, it is \u03a9), equal to \u03a9\u0396. From \u039f let a line be drawn to \u0396\u039a parallel to \u039a\u03a8, and let this be \u039f\u0396. Now since \u0396\u03a9\u039f is equal to \u039a\u03a3\u03a8, and \u039a\u03a3 is imperceptibly greater than \u03a8\u03a3  or \u03a9\u039f (because \u039a\u03a8\u03a3 is right, and the angle at \u03a3 is not greater than 2\u00b0 3\u2019, so that if \u03a8\u03a3 is 100,000, \u039a\u03a3 is 100,064), \u039f\u0396 is also imperceptibly less than \u039a\u03a8. Let \u0396\u0394 be joined, and let a line be drawn at \u039f parallel to \u0396\u0394. Now the moment of time at which the center of the epicycle is placed at \u0396 by Ptolemy and at \u039f by me, is the same, and is designated by both of us by the line \u039a\u03a5 in the theory of the sun. In the theory of Mars, that moment should be designated in the former theory by \u0396\u0394, because \u0394 is the point of equality, while in the new theory it will be designated by a line parallel to \u0396\u0394. Therefore, there will be a new point of equality, about which the time is counted, on this parallel through \u039f. ","681":"Now Ptolemy measured out the courses of the planets, not on the lines \u039a\u03a3, but on the lines \u039a\u03a5 drawn from \u039a parallel to the lines \u03a8\u03a3 passing through the sun\u2019s body. For whenever the planet fell upon these lines \u039a\u03a5 on the side opposite the sun, it was supposed to have shed its second inequality, which fell to it (in Ptolemy\u2019s opinion) because of the epicycle. Then the planet\u2019s sidereal position was sought out by means of instruments, and the center of the epicycle was supposed to be found at that time on the same line. This was done a number of times and at various places on the zodiac: say, \u039a\u0393, \u039a\u03a5, and the points opposite. From three such positions of the planet (or of the center of the epicycle, which, according to Ptolemy, accounts for the second inequality), the practitioner sets out to investigate the hypothesis for the first inequality by comparing these angles which the observed positions form about \u039a, the center of the earth and of observation, with the intervening times. The method for this enterprise is found in Ptolemy Book IX ^19. Now suppose the treatment done, and let the eccentric's line of apsides come out to be \u039a\u039b\u0394\u03a7, with \u0394 the equalizing point, the center of the eccentric upon this line and at point \u039b, and the eccentric \u03a7\u0396. And let this hypothesis correspond to all positions observed at the times of the planet\u2019s opposition to the sun\u2019s mean position.\nHere, the objections I raised against Copernicus concerning the ordering of the physical motion are also not clearly in agreement with Ptolemy. For the center of the epicycle which accounts for the second inequality, here just as the planet itself previously, is borne slowly or swiftly according to its approach  to or recession from the earth \u039a, performed on the circle \u03a7\u0396. Furthermore, to stipulate that there is in the earth \u039a (just as there was before in Copernicus\u2019s sun, the heart of the world) a motive force that drives the centers of this kind of epicycle around, is absurd and monstrous. The hypothesis can also be discredited by another physical argument. For intrinsic to this form of hypothesis, in one way or another, is solidity of the orbs; and since this has been destroyed (by Tycho Brahe\u2019s observations of comets), the hypothesis appears, so to speak, to collapse under its own weight. For a moving force would be declared to reside in the center of the epicycle (not in a body, but in a mathematical point), and to rouse itself to move from place to place, by an unequal amount in equal times; but at the same time would draw the planet along with itself at the distance of the epicycle\u2019s diameter; all the while causing the planet to gyrate around itself, by equal amounts in equal times. That this enormous variety cannot fall to a single moving mind (unless it be God), Aristotle gives supporting arguments in the Metaphysics Book XII Ch. 8: he holds that the individual minds preside over individual, perfectly uniform and simple circular motions. Besides, how will some power sit in a non-body, and flow out of the non-body into the planet? Even if you divide up the tasks, and locate one motive intelligence at the center of the epicycle and another in the body of the planet, the one at the center will use the earth (a body, of course) as its reference, and will move around the earth nonuniformly in a circle, while the one at a point on the circumference (that is, in the planet's body) will move around an incorporeal center and do so uniformly. The question, then, is (as before), by what aids would it move around the incorporeal point? Not by geometrical imagination, for it does not admit of geometrical imagination of itself. Nor can a mobile point subsist in a non-body even in imagination. We humans, in imagining points of this sort, have recourse to the aids of tablets or paper, which we draw upon with our hands or at least remember ourselves to have drawn once. But it likewise cannot happen through a physical flowing of power (which is in the center of the epicycle) out to the circumference and the planet\u2019s body. For we have submitted to this outflow of power on the supposition that the tasks of the compound motions are divided between two minds. Why not also question whether in the first, eccentric motion, some natural force constituted to produce motion might subsist in some point entirely devoid of any body? And even more, whether this kind of incorporeal power can move itself around the earth, and go from place to place? And most of all, whether it can communicate or transfer another's motion through an efflux from itself, although it is not supported by any body that could serve as its nest? Those sublime considerations of the essence, motion, place, and operations of the blessed angels and of separate minds which some people will want to raise in opposition to me, are irrelevant. For we are arguing about natural things which are far inferior in dignity, about powers that exercise no choice of how to vary their action, and about minds which are not in the least separate, since they are yoked and bound to the celestial bodies which they are to bear. These, then, are the general objections that can be raised against  Ptolemy. \nBut something further may be said to Ptolemy, on account of which in particular he would wish to abandon his mean position of the sun and embrace the apparent with us. For if the power moving the planet (whether single or double) acts with respect to the sun, so that it places the planet at the lowest point of the epicycle whenever the center of the epicycle is opposite the sun, I ask (as above) why it looks to the imaginary point \u03a5 (which sometimes precedes and sometimes follows the sun, here marked \u03a3, and is sometimes above and sometimes below it), rather than the sun's body itself? Or how it is that that power can have any perception whatever of the motion of \u03a5 around the earth K, since there is no body at \u03a8? Is it not more probable that the epicycle is restored to the lines \u039a\u03a3 of the sun\u2019s apparent position, when these pass through the center of the epicycle?\n Let us then see what is changed on the eccentric by substitution of the sun\u2019s apparent position. Again (as before) when the sun \u0393, the center of the sun\u2019s eccentric \u03a8, and the earth \u039a are on the same line, so that the line of the sun\u2019s apparent position \u03a8\u0393 and the line of its mean position \u039a\u0393 coincide, then for the center of the epicycle \u03a4 this place remains the same, whether its sidereal position is designated by \u039a\u03a4 or by \u03a8\u03a4, and the planet is really on the line \u039a\u03a4 or \u03a8\u03a4 and at the lowest point on its epicycle \u03a6, since here it is nearest to both \u03a8 and \u039a. The planet is thereby truly divested of its second inequality. But when the sun comes to the side of its eccentric (that is, to the middle distances), a great enough difference arises. For let the sun have gone from \u0393 to \u03a3, and the line of the sun\u2019s mean position \u039a\u03a5 be found in Aries, and the planet\u2019s line of vision \u039a\u03a9 precisely opposite in Libra, so that \u03a5\u039a\u03a9 is a single line. Now since  Ptolemy declared that the planet \u03a9 on this line of vision \u039a\u03a9 is divested of its second inequality, he places the center of the epicycle \u0396 on the line \u039a\u03a9. But since \u039a\u03a3 has gone beyond \u039a\u03a5, the sun\u2019s apparent position is beyond opposition to the planet. And in the last part of the time, \u039a\u03a9 is not descending, so as to be opposite \u039a\u03a3, but ascends towards \u039a\u03a6, because the lowest parts of the epicycle \u03a9 are retrograde and swifter than the center \u0396, and it is there, of course, that the planet is at opposition to the sun. Therefore, this apparent opposition precedes the mean one.\nTherefore, at some time preceding the moment designated by \u039a\u03a5 (let it be \u039a\u0398) when the sun is seen on the line \u039a\u039e, the planet will be seen opposite it (suppose it to be at \u0399) on \u039a\u0399 which forms a straight line with \u039a\u039e. Also, because it is now laid down that it sheds the second inequality at this true opposition, the center of the epicycle will also be seen on this line \u039e\u039a, say at \u039f. And because the planet is retrograde, at the time \u039a\u0398 prior to \u039a\u03a5 the planet is on the line \u039a\u0399 later than at \u039a\u03a9. But \u039a\u0399 and \u039a\u03a9 are parts of the lines \u039a\u039f and \u039a\u0396. Therefore, \u039a\u039f too is more to the east than \u039a\u0396.\nThus it is clear what would be changed on the line of the epicycle\u2019s center by this restoration from the sun\u2019s mean position to its apparent position. For at \u03a4 and the opposite point on the original line the motions of the epicycle\u2019s center remain unchanged. At \u0396 this line, and the center of the epicycle upon it, is moved forward and a subtraction is made from the intervening time.

We are supposing that the center of the epicycle is at this moment on the line \u03a9\u039f, or some other line nearby and parallel, according as \u03a9 (representing the planet) is closer to or farther from \u039a on the line \u039a\u0396. Let \u03a9\u039f be drawn from whatever point on the line \u039a\u0396 (now, it is \u03a9), equal to \u03a9\u0396. From \u039f let a line be drawn to \u0396\u039a parallel to \u039a\u03a8, and let this be \u039f\u0396. Now since \u0396\u03a9\u039f is equal to \u039a\u03a3\u03a8, and \u039a\u03a3 is imperceptibly greater than \u03a8\u03a3  or \u03a9\u039f (because \u039a\u03a8\u03a3 is right, and the angle at \u03a3 is not greater than 2\u00b0 3\u2019, so that if \u03a8\u03a3 is 100,000, \u039a\u03a3 is 100,064), \u039f\u0396 is also imperceptibly less than \u039a\u03a8. Let \u0396\u0394 be joined, and let a line be drawn at \u039f parallel to \u0396\u0394. Now the moment of time at which the center of the epicycle is placed at \u0396 by Ptolemy and at \u039f by me, is the same, and is designated by both of us by the line \u039a\u03a5 in the theory of the sun.

Again (as before) when the sun \u0393, the center of the sun\u2019s eccentric \u03a8, and the earth \u039a are on the same line, so that the line of the sun\u2019s apparent position \u03a8\u0393 and the line of its mean position \u039a\u0393 coincide, then for the center of the epicycle \u03a4 this place remains the same, whether its sidereal position is designated by \u039a\u03a4 or by \u03a8\u03a4, and the planet is really on the line \u039a\u03a4 or \u03a8\u03a4 and at the lowest point on its epicycle \u03a6, since here it is nearest to both \u03a8 and \u039a. The planet is thereby truly divested of its second inequality. But when the sun comes to the side of its eccentric (that is, to the middle distances), a great enough difference arises. For let the sun have gone from \u0393 to \u03a3, and the line of the sun\u2019s mean position \u039a\u03a5 be found in Aries, and the planet\u2019s line of vision \u039a\u03a9 precisely opposite in Libra, so that \u03a5\u039a\u03a9 is a single line. Now since  Ptolemy declared that the planet \u03a9 on this line of vision \u039a\u03a9 is divested of its second inequality, he places the center of the epicycle \u0396 on the line \u039a\u03a9. But since \u039a\u03a3 has gone beyond \u039a\u03a5, the sun\u2019s apparent position is beyond opposition to the planet. And in the last part of the time, \u039a\u03a9 is not descending, so as to be opposite \u039a\u03a3, but ascends towards \u039a\u03a6, because the lowest parts of the epicycle \u03a9 are retrograde and swifter than the center \u0396, and it is there, of course, that the planet is at opposition to the sun. Therefore, this apparent opposition precedes the mean one.\nTherefore, at some time preceding the moment designated by \u039a\u03a5 (let it be \u039a\u0398) when the sun is seen on the line \u039a\u039e, the planet will be seen opposite it (suppose it to be at \u0399) on \u039a\u0399 which forms a straight line with \u039a\u039e. Also, because it is now laid down that it sheds the second inequality at this true opposition, the center of the epicycle will also be seen on this line \u039e\u039a, say at \u039f. And because the planet is retrograde, at the time \u039a\u0398 prior to \u039a\u03a5 the planet is on the line \u039a\u0399 later than at \u039a\u03a9. But \u039a\u0399 and \u039a\u03a9 are parts of the lines \u039a\u039f and \u039a\u0396. Therefore, \u039a\u039f too is more to the east than \u039a\u0396.\nThus it is clear what would be changed on the line of the epicycle\u2019s center by this restoration from the sun\u2019s mean position to its apparent position. For at \u03a4 and the opposite point on the original line the motions of the epicycle\u2019s center remain unchanged. At \u0396 this line, and the center of the epicycle upon it, is moved forward and a subtraction is made from the intervening time. At the opposite place the contrary happens: an addition is made to the time, and the line of motion of the center of the epicycle is moved back westward. And thus these lines of the center of the epicycle differ much from the original lines. For this reason also, when we investigate the causes and measure of the first inequality by a new and repeated operation using these several observed positions of the center of the epicycle (that is, using the observed positions of the planet, after which we suppose the center of the epicycle to lie upon the same line), the outcome of this operation differs much from that of the preceding one. That is, since the time in the semicircle containing the apogee will have been diminished, so that the planet is correspondingly faster, the eccentricity of the equant will come out smaller. And since in the greater quadrant \u0392\u0396 of the semicircle containing the apogee the time will have been diminished by an amount equal to the diminution in the other, smaller part, the planet has been made proportionally much faster in the remaining part of the semicircle. Therefore, the perigee has come closer to the latter, and the apogee has descended from \u03a7 towards \u0396.\nThe quantification of the new hypothesis will be made clear thus. It is presupposed that the planet \u03a9 falls on the line drawn from the center of the epicycle \u0396 through the earth \u039a, only when \u039a\u0396 is collinear with \u039a\u03a3, the sun\u2019s apparent position. Therefore, \u039a\u03a3 and the line drawn from \u0396 through the body of the planet always proceed in parallel. Moreover, we have just taken it from Ptolemy that at the time when the line of the sun\u2019s mean position was \u039a\u03a5, drawn through \u03a9, the planet was observed on the line \u039a\u03a9, and nonetheless we do not grant him that the center of the epicycle \u0396 is on \u039a\u03a9 at the same time. Therefore, in accord with our position, let a line be drawn from the planet\u2019s position \u03a9 parallel to \u039a\u03a3, and let this be \u03a9\u039f. We are supposing that the center of the epicycle is at this moment on the line \u03a9\u039f, or some other line nearby and parallel, according as \u03a9 (representing the planet) is closer to or farther from \u039a on the line \u039a\u0396. Let \u03a9\u039f be drawn from whatever point on the line \u039a\u0396 (now, it is \u03a9), equal to \u03a9\u0396. From \u039f let a line be drawn to \u0396\u039a parallel to \u039a\u03a8, and let this be \u039f\u0396. Now since \u0396\u03a9\u039f is equal to \u039a\u03a3\u03a8, and \u039a\u03a3 is imperceptibly greater than \u03a8\u03a3  or \u03a9\u039f (because \u039a\u03a8\u03a3 is right, and the angle at \u03a3 is not greater than 2\u00b0 3\u2019, so that if \u03a8\u03a3 is 100,000, \u039a\u03a3 is 100,064), \u039f\u0396 is also imperceptibly less than \u039a\u03a8. Let \u0396\u0394 be joined, and let a line be drawn at \u039f parallel to \u0396\u0394. Now the moment of time at which the center of the epicycle is placed at \u0396 by Ptolemy and at \u039f by me, is the same, and is designated by both of us by the line \u039a\u03a5 in the theory of the sun. In the theory of Mars, that moment should be designated in the former theory by \u0396\u0394, because \u0394 is the point of equality, while in the new theory it will be designated by a line parallel to \u0396\u0394. Therefore, there will be a new point of equality, about which the time is counted, on this parallel through \u039f. ","683":"Now Ptolemy measured out the courses of the planets, not on the lines \u039a\u03a3, but on the lines \u039a\u03a5 drawn from \u039a parallel to the lines \u03a8\u03a3 passing through the sun\u2019s body. For whenever the planet fell upon these lines \u039a\u03a5 on the side opposite the sun, it was supposed to have shed its second inequality, which fell to it (in Ptolemy\u2019s opinion) because of the epicycle. Then the planet\u2019s sidereal position was sought out by means of instruments, and the center of the epicycle was supposed to be found at that time on the same line. This was done a number of times and at various places on the zodiac: say, \u039a\u0393, \u039a\u03a5, and the points opposite. From three such positions of the planet (or of the center of the epicycle, which, according to Ptolemy, accounts for the second inequality), the practitioner sets out to investigate the hypothesis for the first inequality by comparing these angles which the observed positions form about \u039a, the center of the earth and of observation, with the intervening times. The method for this enterprise is found in Ptolemy Book IX ^19. Now suppose the treatment done, and let the eccentric's line of apsides come out to be \u039a\u039b\u0394\u03a7, with \u0394 the equalizing point, the center of the eccentric upon this line and at point \u039b, and the eccentric \u03a7\u0396. And let this hypothesis correspond to all positions observed at the times of the planet\u2019s opposition to the sun\u2019s mean position.\nHere, the objections I raised against Copernicus concerning the ordering of the physical motion are also not clearly in agreement with Ptolemy. For the center of the epicycle which accounts for the second inequality, here just as the planet itself previously, is borne slowly or swiftly according to its approach  to or recession from the earth \u039a, performed on the circle \u03a7\u0396. Furthermore, to stipulate that there is in the earth \u039a (just as there was before in Copernicus\u2019s sun, the heart of the world) a motive force that drives the centers of this kind of epicycle around, is absurd and monstrous. The hypothesis can also be discredited by another physical argument. For intrinsic to this form of hypothesis, in one way or another, is solidity of the orbs; and since this has been destroyed (by Tycho Brahe\u2019s observations of comets), the hypothesis appears, so to speak, to collapse under its own weight. For a moving force would be declared to reside in the center of the epicycle (not in a body, but in a mathematical point), and to rouse itself to move from place to place, by an unequal amount in equal times; but at the same time would draw the planet along with itself at the distance of the epicycle\u2019s diameter; all the while causing the planet to gyrate around itself, by equal amounts in equal times. That this enormous variety cannot fall to a single moving mind (unless it be God), Aristotle gives supporting arguments in the Metaphysics Book XII Ch. 8: he holds that the individual minds preside over individual, perfectly uniform and simple circular motions. Besides, how will some power sit in a non-body, and flow out of the non-body into the planet? Even if you divide up the tasks, and locate one motive intelligence at the center of the epicycle and another in the body of the planet, the one at the center will use the earth (a body, of course) as its reference, and will move around the earth nonuniformly in a circle, while the one at a point on the circumference (that is, in the planet's body) will move around an incorporeal center and do so uniformly. The question, then, is (as before), by what aids would it move around the incorporeal point? Not by geometrical imagination, for it does not admit of geometrical imagination of itself. Nor can a mobile point subsist in a non-body even in imagination. We humans, in imagining points of this sort, have recourse to the aids of tablets or paper, which we draw upon with our hands or at least remember ourselves to have drawn once. But it likewise cannot happen through a physical flowing of power (which is in the center of the epicycle) out to the circumference and the planet\u2019s body. For we have submitted to this outflow of power on the supposition that the tasks of the compound motions are divided between two minds. Why not also question whether in the first, eccentric motion, some natural force constituted to produce motion might subsist in some point entirely devoid of any body? And even more, whether this kind of incorporeal power can move itself around the earth, and go from place to place? And most of all, whether it can communicate or transfer another's motion through an efflux from itself, although it is not supported by any body that could serve as its nest? Those sublime considerations of the essence, motion, place, and operations of the blessed angels and of separate minds which some people will want to raise in opposition to me, are irrelevant. For we are arguing about natural things which are far inferior in dignity, about powers that exercise no choice of how to vary their action, and about minds which are not in the least separate, since they are yoked and bound to the celestial bodies which they are to bear. These, then, are the general objections that can be raised against  Ptolemy. \nBut something further may be said to Ptolemy, on account of which in particular he would wish to abandon his mean position of the sun and embrace the apparent with us. For if the power moving the planet (whether single or double) acts with respect to the sun, so that it places the planet at the lowest point of the epicycle whenever the center of the epicycle is opposite the sun, I ask (as above) why it looks to the imaginary point \u03a5 (which sometimes precedes and sometimes follows the sun, here marked \u03a3, and is sometimes above and sometimes below it), rather than the sun's body itself? Or how it is that that power can have any perception whatever of the motion of \u03a5 around the earth K, since there is no body at \u03a8? Is it not more probable that the epicycle is restored to the lines \u039a\u03a3 of the sun\u2019s apparent position, when these pass through the center of the epicycle?\n Let us then see what is changed on the eccentric by substitution of the sun\u2019s apparent position. Again (as before) when the sun \u0393, the center of the sun\u2019s eccentric \u03a8, and the earth \u039a are on the same line, so that the line of the sun\u2019s apparent position \u03a8\u0393 and the line of its mean position \u039a\u0393 coincide, then for the center of the epicycle \u03a4 this place remains the same, whether its sidereal position is designated by \u039a\u03a4 or by \u03a8\u03a4, and the planet is really on the line \u039a\u03a4 or \u03a8\u03a4 and at the lowest point on its epicycle \u03a6, since here it is nearest to both \u03a8 and \u039a. The planet is thereby truly divested of its second inequality. But when the sun comes to the side of its eccentric (that is, to the middle distances), a great enough difference arises. For let the sun have gone from \u0393 to \u03a3, and the line of the sun\u2019s mean position \u039a\u03a5 be found in Aries, and the planet\u2019s line of vision \u039a\u03a9 precisely opposite in Libra, so that \u03a5\u039a\u03a9 is a single line. Now since  Ptolemy declared that the planet \u03a9 on this line of vision \u039a\u03a9 is divested of its second inequality, he places the center of the epicycle \u0396 on the line \u039a\u03a9. But since \u039a\u03a3 has gone beyond \u039a\u03a5, the sun\u2019s apparent position is beyond opposition to the planet. And in the last part of the time, \u039a\u03a9 is not descending, so as to be opposite \u039a\u03a3, but ascends towards \u039a\u03a6, because the lowest parts of the epicycle \u03a9 are retrograde and swifter than the center \u0396, and it is there, of course, that the planet is at opposition to the sun. Therefore, this apparent opposition precedes the mean one.\nTherefore, at some time preceding the moment designated by \u039a\u03a5 (let it be \u039a\u0398) when the sun is seen on the line \u039a\u039e, the planet will be seen opposite it (suppose it to be at \u0399) on \u039a\u0399 which forms a straight line with \u039a\u039e. Also, because it is now laid down that it sheds the second inequality at this true opposition, the center of the epicycle will also be seen on this line \u039e\u039a, say at \u039f. And because the planet is retrograde, at the time \u039a\u0398 prior to \u039a\u03a5 the planet is on the line \u039a\u0399 later than at \u039a\u03a9. But \u039a\u0399 and \u039a\u03a9 are parts of the lines \u039a\u039f and \u039a\u0396. Therefore, \u039a\u039f too is more to the east than \u039a\u0396.\nThus it is clear what would be changed on the line of the epicycle\u2019s center by this restoration from the sun\u2019s mean position to its apparent position. For at \u03a4 and the opposite point on the original line the motions of the epicycle\u2019s center remain unchanged. At \u0396 this line, and the center of the epicycle upon it, is moved forward and a subtraction is made from the intervening time. At the opposite place the contrary happens: an addition is made to the time, and the line of motion of the center of the epicycle is moved back westward.

We are supposing that the center of the epicycle is at this moment on the line \u03a9\u039f, or some other line nearby and parallel, according as \u03a9 (representing the planet) is closer to or farther from \u039a on the line \u039a\u0396. Let \u03a9\u039f be drawn from whatever point on the line \u039a\u0396 (now, it is \u03a9), equal to \u03a9\u0396. From \u039f let a line be drawn to \u0396\u039a parallel to \u039a\u03a8, and let this be \u039f\u0396. Now since \u0396\u03a9\u039f is equal to \u039a\u03a3\u03a8, and \u039a\u03a3 is imperceptibly greater than \u03a8\u03a3  or \u03a9\u039f (because \u039a\u03a8\u03a3 is right, and the angle at \u03a3 is not greater than 2\u00b0 3\u2019, so that if \u03a8\u03a3 is 100,000, \u039a\u03a3 is 100,064), \u039f\u0396 is also imperceptibly less than \u039a\u03a8. Let \u0396\u0394 be joined, and let a line be drawn at \u039f parallel to \u0396\u0394. Now the moment of time at which the center of the epicycle is placed at \u0396 by Ptolemy and at \u039f by me, is the same, and is designated by both of us by the line \u039a\u03a5 in the theory of the sun. In the theory of Mars, that moment should be designated in the former theory by \u0396\u0394, because \u0394 is the point of equality, while in the new theory it will be designated by a line parallel to \u0396\u0394.

For let the sun have gone from \u0393 to \u03a3, and the line of the sun\u2019s mean position \u039a\u03a5 be found in Aries, and the planet\u2019s line of vision \u039a\u03a9 precisely opposite in Libra, so that \u03a5\u039a\u03a9 is a single line. Now since  Ptolemy declared that the planet \u03a9 on this line of vision \u039a\u03a9 is divested of its second inequality, he places the center of the epicycle \u0396 on the line \u039a\u03a9. But since \u039a\u03a3 has gone beyond \u039a\u03a5, the sun\u2019s apparent position is beyond opposition to the planet. And in the last part of the time, \u039a\u03a9 is not descending, so as to be opposite \u039a\u03a3, but ascends towards \u039a\u03a6, because the lowest parts of the epicycle \u03a9 are retrograde and swifter than the center \u0396, and it is there, of course, that the planet is at opposition to the sun. Therefore, this apparent opposition precedes the mean one.\nTherefore, at some time preceding the moment designated by \u039a\u03a5 (let it be \u039a\u0398) when the sun is seen on the line \u039a\u039e, the planet will be seen opposite it (suppose it to be at \u0399) on \u039a\u0399 which forms a straight line with \u039a\u039e. Also, because it is now laid down that it sheds the second inequality at this true opposition, the center of the epicycle will also be seen on this line \u039e\u039a, say at \u039f. And because the planet is retrograde, at the time \u039a\u0398 prior to \u039a\u03a5 the planet is on the line \u039a\u0399 later than at \u039a\u03a9. But \u039a\u0399 and \u039a\u03a9 are parts of the lines \u039a\u039f and \u039a\u0396. Therefore, \u039a\u039f too is more to the east than \u039a\u0396.\nThus it is clear what would be changed on the line of the epicycle\u2019s center by this restoration from the sun\u2019s mean position to its apparent position. For at \u03a4 and the opposite point on the original line the motions of the epicycle\u2019s center remain unchanged. At \u0396 this line, and the center of the epicycle upon it, is moved forward and a subtraction is made from the intervening time. At the opposite place the contrary happens: an addition is made to the time, and the line of motion of the center of the epicycle is moved back westward. And thus these lines of the center of the epicycle differ much from the original lines. For this reason also, when we investigate the causes and measure of the first inequality by a new and repeated operation using these several observed positions of the center of the epicycle (that is, using the observed positions of the planet, after which we suppose the center of the epicycle to lie upon the same line), the outcome of this operation differs much from that of the preceding one. That is, since the time in the semicircle containing the apogee will have been diminished, so that the planet is correspondingly faster, the eccentricity of the equant will come out smaller. And since in the greater quadrant \u0392\u0396 of the semicircle containing the apogee the time will have been diminished by an amount equal to the diminution in the other, smaller part, the planet has been made proportionally much faster in the remaining part of the semicircle. Therefore, the perigee has come closer to the latter, and the apogee has descended from \u03a7 towards \u0396.\nThe quantification of the new hypothesis will be made clear thus. It is presupposed that the planet \u03a9 falls on the line drawn from the center of the epicycle \u0396 through the earth \u039a, only when \u039a\u0396 is collinear with \u039a\u03a3, the sun\u2019s apparent position. Therefore, \u039a\u03a3 and the line drawn from \u0396 through the body of the planet always proceed in parallel. Moreover, we have just taken it from Ptolemy that at the time when the line of the sun\u2019s mean position was \u039a\u03a5, drawn through \u03a9, the planet was observed on the line \u039a\u03a9, and nonetheless we do not grant him that the center of the epicycle \u0396 is on \u039a\u03a9 at the same time. Therefore, in accord with our position, let a line be drawn from the planet\u2019s position \u03a9 parallel to \u039a\u03a3, and let this be \u03a9\u039f. We are supposing that the center of the epicycle is at this moment on the line \u03a9\u039f, or some other line nearby and parallel, according as \u03a9 (representing the planet) is closer to or farther from \u039a on the line \u039a\u0396. Let \u03a9\u039f be drawn from whatever point on the line \u039a\u0396 (now, it is \u03a9), equal to \u03a9\u0396. From \u039f let a line be drawn to \u0396\u039a parallel to \u039a\u03a8, and let this be \u039f\u0396. Now since \u0396\u03a9\u039f is equal to \u039a\u03a3\u03a8, and \u039a\u03a3 is imperceptibly greater than \u03a8\u03a3  or \u03a9\u039f (because \u039a\u03a8\u03a3 is right, and the angle at \u03a3 is not greater than 2\u00b0 3\u2019, so that if \u03a8\u03a3 is 100,000, \u039a\u03a3 is 100,064), \u039f\u0396 is also imperceptibly less than \u039a\u03a8. Let \u0396\u0394 be joined, and let a line be drawn at \u039f parallel to \u0396\u0394. Now the moment of time at which the center of the epicycle is placed at \u0396 by Ptolemy and at \u039f by me, is the same, and is designated by both of us by the line \u039a\u03a5 in the theory of the sun. In the theory of Mars, that moment should be designated in the former theory by \u0396\u0394, because \u0394 is the point of equality, while in the new theory it will be designated by a line parallel to \u0396\u0394. Therefore, there will be a new point of equality, about which the time is counted, on this parallel through \u039f. ","685":"Now Ptolemy measured out the courses of the planets, not on the lines \u039a\u03a3, but on the lines \u039a\u03a5 drawn from \u039a parallel to the lines \u03a8\u03a3 passing through the sun\u2019s body. For whenever the planet fell upon these lines \u039a\u03a5 on the side opposite the sun, it was supposed to have shed its second inequality, which fell to it (in Ptolemy\u2019s opinion) because of the epicycle. Then the planet\u2019s sidereal position was sought out by means of instruments, and the center of the epicycle was supposed to be found at that time on the same line. This was done a number of times and at various places on the zodiac: say, \u039a\u0393, \u039a\u03a5, and the points opposite. From three such positions of the planet (or of the center of the epicycle, which, according to Ptolemy, accounts for the second inequality), the practitioner sets out to investigate the hypothesis for the first inequality by comparing these angles which the observed positions form about \u039a, the center of the earth and of observation, with the intervening times. The method for this enterprise is found in Ptolemy Book IX ^19. Now suppose the treatment done, and let the eccentric's line of apsides come out to be \u039a\u039b\u0394\u03a7, with \u0394 the equalizing point, the center of the eccentric upon this line and at point \u039b, and the eccentric \u03a7\u0396. And let this hypothesis correspond to all positions observed at the times of the planet\u2019s opposition to the sun\u2019s mean position.\nHere, the objections I raised against Copernicus concerning the ordering of the physical motion are also not clearly in agreement with Ptolemy. For the center of the epicycle which accounts for the second inequality, here just as the planet itself previously, is borne slowly or swiftly according to its approach  to or recession from the earth \u039a, performed on the circle \u03a7\u0396. Furthermore, to stipulate that there is in the earth \u039a (just as there was before in Copernicus\u2019s sun, the heart of the world) a motive force that drives the centers of this kind of epicycle around, is absurd and monstrous. The hypothesis can also be discredited by another physical argument. For intrinsic to this form of hypothesis, in one way or another, is solidity of the orbs; and since this has been destroyed (by Tycho Brahe\u2019s observations of comets), the hypothesis appears, so to speak, to collapse under its own weight. For a moving force would be declared to reside in the center of the epicycle (not in a body, but in a mathematical point), and to rouse itself to move from place to place, by an unequal amount in equal times; but at the same time would draw the planet along with itself at the distance of the epicycle\u2019s diameter; all the while causing the planet to gyrate around itself, by equal amounts in equal times. That this enormous variety cannot fall to a single moving mind (unless it be God), Aristotle gives supporting arguments in the Metaphysics Book XII Ch. 8: he holds that the individual minds preside over individual, perfectly uniform and simple circular motions. Besides, how will some power sit in a non-body, and flow out of the non-body into the planet? Even if you divide up the tasks, and locate one motive intelligence at the center of the epicycle and another in the body of the planet, the one at the center will use the earth (a body, of course) as its reference, and will move around the earth nonuniformly in a circle, while the one at a point on the circumference (that is, in the planet's body) will move around an incorporeal center and do so uniformly. The question, then, is (as before), by what aids would it move around the incorporeal point? Not by geometrical imagination, for it does not admit of geometrical imagination of itself. Nor can a mobile point subsist in a non-body even in imagination. We humans, in imagining points of this sort, have recourse to the aids of tablets or paper, which we draw upon with our hands or at least remember ourselves to have drawn once. But it likewise cannot happen through a physical flowing of power (which is in the center of the epicycle) out to the circumference and the planet\u2019s body. For we have submitted to this outflow of power on the supposition that the tasks of the compound motions are divided between two minds. Why not also question whether in the first, eccentric motion, some natural force constituted to produce motion might subsist in some point entirely devoid of any body? And even more, whether this kind of incorporeal power can move itself around the earth, and go from place to place? And most of all, whether it can communicate or transfer another's motion through an efflux from itself, although it is not supported by any body that could serve as its nest? Those sublime considerations of the essence, motion, place, and operations of the blessed angels and of separate minds which some people will want to raise in opposition to me, are irrelevant. For we are arguing about natural things which are far inferior in dignity, about powers that exercise no choice of how to vary their action, and about minds which are not in the least separate, since they are yoked and bound to the celestial bodies which they are to bear. These, then, are the general objections that can be raised against  Ptolemy. \nBut something further may be said to Ptolemy, on account of which in particular he would wish to abandon his mean position of the sun and embrace the apparent with us. For if the power moving the planet (whether single or double) acts with respect to the sun, so that it places the planet at the lowest point of the epicycle whenever the center of the epicycle is opposite the sun, I ask (as above) why it looks to the imaginary point \u03a5 (which sometimes precedes and sometimes follows the sun, here marked \u03a3, and is sometimes above and sometimes below it), rather than the sun's body itself? Or how it is that that power can have any perception whatever of the motion of \u03a5 around the earth K, since there is no body at \u03a8? Is it not more probable that the epicycle is restored to the lines \u039a\u03a3 of the sun\u2019s apparent position, when these pass through the center of the epicycle?\n Let us then see what is changed on the eccentric by substitution of the sun\u2019s apparent position. Again (as before) when the sun \u0393, the center of the sun\u2019s eccentric \u03a8, and the earth \u039a are on the same line, so that the line of the sun\u2019s apparent position \u03a8\u0393 and the line of its mean position \u039a\u0393 coincide, then for the center of the epicycle \u03a4 this place remains the same, whether its sidereal position is designated by \u039a\u03a4 or by \u03a8\u03a4, and the planet is really on the line \u039a\u03a4 or \u03a8\u03a4 and at the lowest point on its epicycle \u03a6, since here it is nearest to both \u03a8 and \u039a. The planet is thereby truly divested of its second inequality. But when the sun comes to the side of its eccentric (that is, to the middle distances), a great enough difference arises. For let the sun have gone from \u0393 to \u03a3, and the line of the sun\u2019s mean position \u039a\u03a5 be found in Aries, and the planet\u2019s line of vision \u039a\u03a9 precisely opposite in Libra, so that \u03a5\u039a\u03a9 is a single line. Now since  Ptolemy declared that the planet \u03a9 on this line of vision \u039a\u03a9 is divested of its second inequality, he places the center of the epicycle \u0396 on the line \u039a\u03a9. But since \u039a\u03a3 has gone beyond \u039a\u03a5, the sun\u2019s apparent position is beyond opposition to the planet. And in the last part of the time, \u039a\u03a9 is not descending, so as to be opposite \u039a\u03a3, but ascends towards \u039a\u03a6, because the lowest parts of the epicycle \u03a9 are retrograde and swifter than the center \u0396, and it is there, of course, that the planet is at opposition to the sun. Therefore, this apparent opposition precedes the mean one.\nTherefore, at some time preceding the moment designated by \u039a\u03a5 (let it be \u039a\u0398) when the sun is seen on the line \u039a\u039e, the planet will be seen opposite it (suppose it to be at \u0399) on \u039a\u0399 which forms a straight line with \u039a\u039e. Also, because it is now laid down that it sheds the second inequality at this true opposition, the center of the epicycle will also be seen on this line \u039e\u039a, say at \u039f. And because the planet is retrograde, at the time \u039a\u0398 prior to \u039a\u03a5 the planet is on the line \u039a\u0399 later than at \u039a\u03a9. But \u039a\u0399 and \u039a\u03a9 are parts of the lines \u039a\u039f and \u039a\u0396. Therefore, \u039a\u039f too is more to the east than \u039a\u0396.\nThus it is clear what would be changed on the line of the epicycle\u2019s center by this restoration from the sun\u2019s mean position to its apparent position. For at \u03a4 and the opposite point on the original line the motions of the epicycle\u2019s center remain unchanged. At \u0396 this line, and the center of the epicycle upon it, is moved forward and a subtraction is made from the intervening time. At the opposite place the contrary happens: an addition is made to the time, and the line of motion of the center of the epicycle is moved back westward. And thus these lines of the center of the epicycle differ much from the original lines. For this reason also, when we investigate the causes and measure of the first inequality by a new and repeated operation using these several observed positions of the center of the epicycle (that is, using the observed positions of the planet, after which we suppose the center of the epicycle to lie upon the same line), the outcome of this operation differs much from that of the preceding one. That is, since the time in the semicircle containing the apogee will have been diminished, so that the planet is correspondingly faster, the eccentricity of the equant will come out smaller. And since in the greater quadrant \u0392\u0396 of the semicircle containing the apogee the time will have been diminished by an amount equal to the diminution in the other, smaller part, the planet has been made proportionally much faster in the remaining part of the semicircle. Therefore, the perigee has come closer to the latter, and the apogee has descended from \u03a7 towards \u0396.\nThe quantification of the new hypothesis will be made clear thus. It is presupposed that the planet \u03a9 falls on the line drawn from the center of the epicycle \u0396 through the earth \u039a, only when \u039a\u0396 is collinear with \u039a\u03a3, the sun\u2019s apparent position.

We are supposing that the center of the epicycle is at this moment on the line \u03a9\u039f, or some other line nearby and parallel, according as \u03a9 (representing the planet) is closer to or farther from \u039a on the line \u039a\u0396. Let \u03a9\u039f be drawn from whatever point on the line \u039a\u0396 (now, it is \u03a9), equal to \u03a9\u0396. From \u039f let a line be drawn to \u0396\u039a parallel to \u039a\u03a8, and let this be \u039f\u0396. Now since \u0396\u03a9\u039f is equal to \u039a\u03a3\u03a8, and \u039a\u03a3 is imperceptibly greater than \u03a8\u03a3  or \u03a9\u039f (because \u039a\u03a8\u03a3 is right, and the angle at \u03a3 is not greater than 2\u00b0 3\u2019, so that if \u03a8\u03a3 is 100,000, \u039a\u03a3 is 100,064), \u039f\u0396 is also imperceptibly less than \u039a\u03a8. Let \u0396\u0394 be joined, and let a line be drawn at \u039f parallel to \u0396\u0394. Now the moment of time at which the center of the epicycle is placed at \u0396 by Ptolemy and at \u039f by me, is the same, and is designated by both of us by the line \u039a\u03a5 in the theory of the sun. In the theory of Mars, that moment should be designated in the former theory by \u0396\u0394, because \u0394 is the point of equality, while in the new theory it will be designated by a line parallel to \u0396\u0394.

Now since  Ptolemy declared that the planet \u03a9 on this line of vision \u039a\u03a9 is divested of its second inequality, he places the center of the epicycle \u0396 on the line \u039a\u03a9. But since \u039a\u03a3 has gone beyond \u039a\u03a5, the sun\u2019s apparent position is beyond opposition to the planet. And in the last part of the time, \u039a\u03a9 is not descending, so as to be opposite \u039a\u03a3, but ascends towards \u039a\u03a6, because the lowest parts of the epicycle \u03a9 are retrograde and swifter than the center \u0396, and it is there, of course, that the planet is at opposition to the sun. Therefore, this apparent opposition precedes the mean one.\nTherefore, at some time preceding the moment designated by \u039a\u03a5 (let it be \u039a\u0398) when the sun is seen on the line \u039a\u039e, the planet will be seen opposite it (suppose it to be at \u0399) on \u039a\u0399 which forms a straight line with \u039a\u039e. Also, because it is now laid down that it sheds the second inequality at this true opposition, the center of the epicycle will also be seen on this line \u039e\u039a, say at \u039f. And because the planet is retrograde, at the time \u039a\u0398 prior to \u039a\u03a5 the planet is on the line \u039a\u0399 later than at \u039a\u03a9. But \u039a\u0399 and \u039a\u03a9 are parts of the lines \u039a\u039f and \u039a\u0396. Therefore, \u039a\u039f too is more to the east than \u039a\u0396.\nThus it is clear what would be changed on the line of the epicycle\u2019s center by this restoration from the sun\u2019s mean position to its apparent position. For at \u03a4 and the opposite point on the original line the motions of the epicycle\u2019s center remain unchanged. At \u0396 this line, and the center of the epicycle upon it, is moved forward and a subtraction is made from the intervening time. At the opposite place the contrary happens: an addition is made to the time, and the line of motion of the center of the epicycle is moved back westward. And thus these lines of the center of the epicycle differ much from the original lines. For this reason also, when we investigate the causes and measure of the first inequality by a new and repeated operation using these several observed positions of the center of the epicycle (that is, using the observed positions of the planet, after which we suppose the center of the epicycle to lie upon the same line), the outcome of this operation differs much from that of the preceding one. That is, since the time in the semicircle containing the apogee will have been diminished, so that the planet is correspondingly faster, the eccentricity of the equant will come out smaller. And since in the greater quadrant \u0392\u0396 of the semicircle containing the apogee the time will have been diminished by an amount equal to the diminution in the other, smaller part, the planet has been made proportionally much faster in the remaining part of the semicircle. Therefore, the perigee has come closer to the latter, and the apogee has descended from \u03a7 towards \u0396.\nThe quantification of the new hypothesis will be made clear thus. It is presupposed that the planet \u03a9 falls on the line drawn from the center of the epicycle \u0396 through the earth \u039a, only when \u039a\u0396 is collinear with \u039a\u03a3, the sun\u2019s apparent position. Therefore, \u039a\u03a3 and the line drawn from \u0396 through the body of the planet always proceed in parallel. Moreover, we have just taken it from Ptolemy that at the time when the line of the sun\u2019s mean position was \u039a\u03a5, drawn through \u03a9, the planet was observed on the line \u039a\u03a9, and nonetheless we do not grant him that the center of the epicycle \u0396 is on \u039a\u03a9 at the same time. Therefore, in accord with our position, let a line be drawn from the planet\u2019s position \u03a9 parallel to \u039a\u03a3, and let this be \u03a9\u039f. We are supposing that the center of the epicycle is at this moment on the line \u03a9\u039f, or some other line nearby and parallel, according as \u03a9 (representing the planet) is closer to or farther from \u039a on the line \u039a\u0396. Let \u03a9\u039f be drawn from whatever point on the line \u039a\u0396 (now, it is \u03a9), equal to \u03a9\u0396. From \u039f let a line be drawn to \u0396\u039a parallel to \u039a\u03a8, and let this be \u039f\u0396. Now since \u0396\u03a9\u039f is equal to \u039a\u03a3\u03a8, and \u039a\u03a3 is imperceptibly greater than \u03a8\u03a3  or \u03a9\u039f (because \u039a\u03a8\u03a3 is right, and the angle at \u03a3 is not greater than 2\u00b0 3\u2019, so that if \u03a8\u03a3 is 100,000, \u039a\u03a3 is 100,064), \u039f\u0396 is also imperceptibly less than \u039a\u03a8. Let \u0396\u0394 be joined, and let a line be drawn at \u039f parallel to \u0396\u0394. Now the moment of time at which the center of the epicycle is placed at \u0396 by Ptolemy and at \u039f by me, is the same, and is designated by both of us by the line \u039a\u03a5 in the theory of the sun. In the theory of Mars, that moment should be designated in the former theory by \u0396\u0394, because \u0394 is the point of equality, while in the new theory it will be designated by a line parallel to \u0396\u0394. Therefore, there will be a new point of equality, about which the time is counted, on this parallel through \u039f. ","687":"Now Ptolemy measured out the courses of the planets, not on the lines \u039a\u03a3, but on the lines \u039a\u03a5 drawn from \u039a parallel to the lines \u03a8\u03a3 passing through the sun\u2019s body. For whenever the planet fell upon these lines \u039a\u03a5 on the side opposite the sun, it was supposed to have shed its second inequality, which fell to it (in Ptolemy\u2019s opinion) because of the epicycle. Then the planet\u2019s sidereal position was sought out by means of instruments, and the center of the epicycle was supposed to be found at that time on the same line. This was done a number of times and at various places on the zodiac: say, \u039a\u0393, \u039a\u03a5, and the points opposite. From three such positions of the planet (or of the center of the epicycle, which, according to Ptolemy, accounts for the second inequality), the practitioner sets out to investigate the hypothesis for the first inequality by comparing these angles which the observed positions form about \u039a, the center of the earth and of observation, with the intervening times. The method for this enterprise is found in Ptolemy Book IX ^19. Now suppose the treatment done, and let the eccentric's line of apsides come out to be \u039a\u039b\u0394\u03a7, with \u0394 the equalizing point, the center of the eccentric upon this line and at point \u039b, and the eccentric \u03a7\u0396. And let this hypothesis correspond to all positions observed at the times of the planet\u2019s opposition to the sun\u2019s mean position.\nHere, the objections I raised against Copernicus concerning the ordering of the physical motion are also not clearly in agreement with Ptolemy. For the center of the epicycle which accounts for the second inequality, here just as the planet itself previously, is borne slowly or swiftly according to its approach  to or recession from the earth \u039a, performed on the circle \u03a7\u0396. Furthermore, to stipulate that there is in the earth \u039a (just as there was before in Copernicus\u2019s sun, the heart of the world) a motive force that drives the centers of this kind of epicycle around, is absurd and monstrous. The hypothesis can also be discredited by another physical argument. For intrinsic to this form of hypothesis, in one way or another, is solidity of the orbs; and since this has been destroyed (by Tycho Brahe\u2019s observations of comets), the hypothesis appears, so to speak, to collapse under its own weight. For a moving force would be declared to reside in the center of the epicycle (not in a body, but in a mathematical point), and to rouse itself to move from place to place, by an unequal amount in equal times; but at the same time would draw the planet along with itself at the distance of the epicycle\u2019s diameter; all the while causing the planet to gyrate around itself, by equal amounts in equal times. That this enormous variety cannot fall to a single moving mind (unless it be God), Aristotle gives supporting arguments in the Metaphysics Book XII Ch. 8: he holds that the individual minds preside over individual, perfectly uniform and simple circular motions. Besides, how will some power sit in a non-body, and flow out of the non-body into the planet? Even if you divide up the tasks, and locate one motive intelligence at the center of the epicycle and another in the body of the planet, the one at the center will use the earth (a body, of course) as its reference, and will move around the earth nonuniformly in a circle, while the one at a point on the circumference (that is, in the planet's body) will move around an incorporeal center and do so uniformly. The question, then, is (as before), by what aids would it move around the incorporeal point? Not by geometrical imagination, for it does not admit of geometrical imagination of itself. Nor can a mobile point subsist in a non-body even in imagination. We humans, in imagining points of this sort, have recourse to the aids of tablets or paper, which we draw upon with our hands or at least remember ourselves to have drawn once. But it likewise cannot happen through a physical flowing of power (which is in the center of the epicycle) out to the circumference and the planet\u2019s body. For we have submitted to this outflow of power on the supposition that the tasks of the compound motions are divided between two minds. Why not also question whether in the first, eccentric motion, some natural force constituted to produce motion might subsist in some point entirely devoid of any body? And even more, whether this kind of incorporeal power can move itself around the earth, and go from place to place? And most of all, whether it can communicate or transfer another's motion through an efflux from itself, although it is not supported by any body that could serve as its nest? Those sublime considerations of the essence, motion, place, and operations of the blessed angels and of separate minds which some people will want to raise in opposition to me, are irrelevant. For we are arguing about natural things which are far inferior in dignity, about powers that exercise no choice of how to vary their action, and about minds which are not in the least separate, since they are yoked and bound to the celestial bodies which they are to bear. These, then, are the general objections that can be raised against  Ptolemy. \nBut something further may be said to Ptolemy, on account of which in particular he would wish to abandon his mean position of the sun and embrace the apparent with us. For if the power moving the planet (whether single or double) acts with respect to the sun, so that it places the planet at the lowest point of the epicycle whenever the center of the epicycle is opposite the sun, I ask (as above) why it looks to the imaginary point \u03a5 (which sometimes precedes and sometimes follows the sun, here marked \u03a3, and is sometimes above and sometimes below it), rather than the sun's body itself? Or how it is that that power can have any perception whatever of the motion of \u03a5 around the earth K, since there is no body at \u03a8? Is it not more probable that the epicycle is restored to the lines \u039a\u03a3 of the sun\u2019s apparent position, when these pass through the center of the epicycle?\n Let us then see what is changed on the eccentric by substitution of the sun\u2019s apparent position. Again (as before) when the sun \u0393, the center of the sun\u2019s eccentric \u03a8, and the earth \u039a are on the same line, so that the line of the sun\u2019s apparent position \u03a8\u0393 and the line of its mean position \u039a\u0393 coincide, then for the center of the epicycle \u03a4 this place remains the same, whether its sidereal position is designated by \u039a\u03a4 or by \u03a8\u03a4, and the planet is really on the line \u039a\u03a4 or \u03a8\u03a4 and at the lowest point on its epicycle \u03a6, since here it is nearest to both \u03a8 and \u039a. The planet is thereby truly divested of its second inequality. But when the sun comes to the side of its eccentric (that is, to the middle distances), a great enough difference arises. For let the sun have gone from \u0393 to \u03a3, and the line of the sun\u2019s mean position \u039a\u03a5 be found in Aries, and the planet\u2019s line of vision \u039a\u03a9 precisely opposite in Libra, so that \u03a5\u039a\u03a9 is a single line. Now since  Ptolemy declared that the planet \u03a9 on this line of vision \u039a\u03a9 is divested of its second inequality, he places the center of the epicycle \u0396 on the line \u039a\u03a9. But since \u039a\u03a3 has gone beyond \u039a\u03a5, the sun\u2019s apparent position is beyond opposition to the planet. And in the last part of the time, \u039a\u03a9 is not descending, so as to be opposite \u039a\u03a3, but ascends towards \u039a\u03a6, because the lowest parts of the epicycle \u03a9 are retrograde and swifter than the center \u0396, and it is there, of course, that the planet is at opposition to the sun. Therefore, this apparent opposition precedes the mean one.\nTherefore, at some time preceding the moment designated by \u039a\u03a5 (let it be \u039a\u0398) when the sun is seen on the line \u039a\u039e, the planet will be seen opposite it (suppose it to be at \u0399) on \u039a\u0399 which forms a straight line with \u039a\u039e. Also, because it is now laid down that it sheds the second inequality at this true opposition, the center of the epicycle will also be seen on this line \u039e\u039a, say at \u039f. And because the planet is retrograde, at the time \u039a\u0398 prior to \u039a\u03a5 the planet is on the line \u039a\u0399 later than at \u039a\u03a9. But \u039a\u0399 and \u039a\u03a9 are parts of the lines \u039a\u039f and \u039a\u0396. Therefore, \u039a\u039f too is more to the east than \u039a\u0396.\nThus it is clear what would be changed on the line of the epicycle\u2019s center by this restoration from the sun\u2019s mean position to its apparent position. For at \u03a4 and the opposite point on the original line the motions of the epicycle\u2019s center remain unchanged. At \u0396 this line, and the center of the epicycle upon it, is moved forward and a subtraction is made from the intervening time. At the opposite place the contrary happens: an addition is made to the time, and the line of motion of the center of the epicycle is moved back westward. And thus these lines of the center of the epicycle differ much from the original lines. For this reason also, when we investigate the causes and measure of the first inequality by a new and repeated operation using these several observed positions of the center of the epicycle (that is, using the observed positions of the planet, after which we suppose the center of the epicycle to lie upon the same line), the outcome of this operation differs much from that of the preceding one. That is, since the time in the semicircle containing the apogee will have been diminished, so that the planet is correspondingly faster, the eccentricity of the equant will come out smaller. And since in the greater quadrant \u0392\u0396 of the semicircle containing the apogee the time will have been diminished by an amount equal to the diminution in the other, smaller part, the planet has been made proportionally much faster in the remaining part of the semicircle. Therefore, the perigee has come closer to the latter, and the apogee has descended from \u03a7 towards \u0396.\nThe quantification of the new hypothesis will be made clear thus. It is presupposed that the planet \u03a9 falls on the line drawn from the center of the epicycle \u0396 through the earth \u039a, only when \u039a\u0396 is collinear with \u039a\u03a3, the sun\u2019s apparent position. Therefore, \u039a\u03a3 and the line drawn from \u0396 through the body of the planet always proceed in parallel. Moreover, we have just taken it from Ptolemy that at the time when the line of the sun\u2019s mean position was \u039a\u03a5, drawn through \u03a9, the planet was observed on the line \u039a\u03a9, and nonetheless we do not grant him that the center of the epicycle \u0396 is on \u039a\u03a9 at the same time. Therefore, in accord with our position, let a line be drawn from the planet\u2019s position \u03a9 parallel to \u039a\u03a3, and let this be \u03a9\u039f. We are supposing that the center of the epicycle is at this moment on the line \u03a9\u039f, or some other line nearby and parallel, according as \u03a9 (representing the planet) is closer to or farther from \u039a on the line \u039a\u0396. Let \u03a9\u039f be drawn from whatever point on the line \u039a\u0396 (now, it is \u03a9), equal to \u03a9\u0396. From \u039f let a line be drawn to \u0396\u039a parallel to \u039a\u03a8, and let this be \u039f\u0396. Now since \u0396\u03a9\u039f is equal to \u039a\u03a3\u03a8, and \u039a\u03a3 is imperceptibly greater than \u03a8\u03a3  or \u03a9\u039f (because \u039a\u03a8\u03a3 is right, and the angle at \u03a3 is not greater than 2\u00b0 3\u2019, so that if \u03a8\u03a3 is 100,000, \u039a\u03a3 is 100,064), \u039f\u0396 is also imperceptibly less than \u039a\u03a8. Let \u0396\u0394 be joined, and let a line be drawn at \u039f parallel to \u0396\u0394. Now the moment of time at which the center of the epicycle is placed at \u0396 by Ptolemy and at \u039f by me, is the same, and is designated by both of us by the line \u039a\u03a5 in the theory of the sun. In the theory of Mars, that moment should be designated in the former theory by \u0396\u0394, because \u0394 is the point of equality, while in the new theory it will be designated by a line parallel to \u0396\u0394. Therefore, there will be a new point of equality, about which the time is counted, on this parallel through \u039f.

Now since  Ptolemy declared that the planet \u03a9 on this line of vision \u039a\u03a9 is divested of its second inequality, he places the center of the epicycle \u0396 on the line \u039a\u03a9. But since \u039a\u03a3 has gone beyond \u039a\u03a5, the sun\u2019s apparent position is beyond opposition to the planet. And in the last part of the time, \u039a\u03a9 is not descending, so as to be opposite \u039a\u03a3, but ascends towards \u039a\u03a6, because the lowest parts of the epicycle \u03a9 are retrograde and swifter than the center \u0396, and it is there, of course, that the planet is at opposition to the sun. Therefore, this apparent opposition precedes the mean one.\nTherefore, at some time preceding the moment designated by \u039a\u03a5 (let it be \u039a\u0398) when the sun is seen on the line \u039a\u039e, the planet will be seen opposite it (suppose it to be at \u0399) on \u039a\u0399 which forms a straight line with \u039a\u039e. Also, because it is now laid down that it sheds the second inequality at this true opposition, the center of the epicycle will also be seen on this line \u039e\u039a, say at \u039f. And because the planet is retrograde, at the time \u039a\u0398 prior to \u039a\u03a5 the planet is on the line \u039a\u0399 later than at \u039a\u03a9. But \u039a\u0399 and \u039a\u03a9 are parts of the lines \u039a\u039f and \u039a\u0396. Therefore, \u039a\u039f too is more to the east than \u039a\u0396.\nThus it is clear what would be changed on the line of the epicycle\u2019s center by this restoration from the sun\u2019s mean position to its apparent position. For at \u03a4 and the opposite point on the original line the motions of the epicycle\u2019s center remain unchanged. At \u0396 this line, and the center of the epicycle upon it, is moved forward and a subtraction is made from the intervening time. At the opposite place the contrary happens: an addition is made to the time, and the line of motion of the center of the epicycle is moved back westward. And thus these lines of the center of the epicycle differ much from the original lines. For this reason also, when we investigate the causes and measure of the first inequality by a new and repeated operation using these several observed positions of the center of the epicycle (that is, using the observed positions of the planet, after which we suppose the center of the epicycle to lie upon the same line), the outcome of this operation differs much from that of the preceding one. That is, since the time in the semicircle containing the apogee will have been diminished, so that the planet is correspondingly faster, the eccentricity of the equant will come out smaller. And since in the greater quadrant \u0392\u0396 of the semicircle containing the apogee the time will have been diminished by an amount equal to the diminution in the other, smaller part, the planet has been made proportionally much faster in the remaining part of the semicircle. Therefore, the perigee has come closer to the latter, and the apogee has descended from \u03a7 towards \u0396.\nThe quantification of the new hypothesis will be made clear thus. It is presupposed that the planet \u03a9 falls on the line drawn from the center of the epicycle \u0396 through the earth \u039a, only when \u039a\u0396 is collinear with \u039a\u03a3, the sun\u2019s apparent position. Therefore, \u039a\u03a3 and the line drawn from \u0396 through the body of the planet always proceed in parallel. Moreover, we have just taken it from Ptolemy that at the time when the line of the sun\u2019s mean position was \u039a\u03a5, drawn through \u03a9, the planet was observed on the line \u039a\u03a9, and nonetheless we do not grant him that the center of the epicycle \u0396 is on \u039a\u03a9 at the same time. Therefore, in accord with our position, let a line be drawn from the planet\u2019s position \u03a9 parallel to \u039a\u03a3, and let this be \u03a9\u039f. We are supposing that the center of the epicycle is at this moment on the line \u03a9\u039f, or some other line nearby and parallel, according as \u03a9 (representing the planet) is closer to or farther from \u039a on the line \u039a\u0396. Let \u03a9\u039f be drawn from whatever point on the line \u039a\u0396 (now, it is \u03a9), equal to \u03a9\u0396. From \u039f let a line be drawn to \u0396\u039a parallel to \u039a\u03a8, and let this be \u039f\u0396. Now since \u0396\u03a9\u039f is equal to \u039a\u03a3\u03a8, and \u039a\u03a3 is imperceptibly greater than \u03a8\u03a3  or \u03a9\u039f (because \u039a\u03a8\u03a3 is right, and the angle at \u03a3 is not greater than 2\u00b0 3\u2019, so that if \u03a8\u03a3 is 100,000, \u039a\u03a3 is 100,064), \u039f\u0396 is also imperceptibly less than \u039a\u03a8. Let \u0396\u0394 be joined, and let a line be drawn at \u039f parallel to \u0396\u0394. Now the moment of time at which the center of the epicycle is placed at \u0396 by Ptolemy and at \u039f by me, is the same, and is designated by both of us by the line \u039a\u03a5 in the theory of the sun. In the theory of Mars, that moment should be designated in the former theory by \u0396\u0394, because \u0394 is the point of equality, while in the new theory it will be designated by a line parallel to \u0396\u0394. Therefore, there will be a new point of equality, about which the time is counted, on this parallel through \u039f. ","689":"Now Ptolemy measured out the courses of the planets, not on the lines \u039a\u03a3, but on the lines \u039a\u03a5 drawn from \u039a parallel to the lines \u03a8\u03a3 passing through the sun\u2019s body. For whenever the planet fell upon these lines \u039a\u03a5 on the side opposite the sun, it was supposed to have shed its second inequality, which fell to it (in Ptolemy\u2019s opinion) because of the epicycle. Then the planet\u2019s sidereal position was sought out by means of instruments, and the center of the epicycle was supposed to be found at that time on the same line. This was done a number of times and at various places on the zodiac: say, \u039a\u0393, \u039a\u03a5, and the points opposite. From three such positions of the planet (or of the center of the epicycle, which, according to Ptolemy, accounts for the second inequality), the practitioner sets out to investigate the hypothesis for the first inequality by comparing these angles which the observed positions form about \u039a, the center of the earth and of observation, with the intervening times. The method for this enterprise is found in Ptolemy Book IX ^19. Now suppose the treatment done, and let the eccentric's line of apsides come out to be \u039a\u039b\u0394\u03a7, with \u0394 the equalizing point, the center of the eccentric upon this line and at point \u039b, and the eccentric \u03a7\u0396. And let this hypothesis correspond to all positions observed at the times of the planet\u2019s opposition to the sun\u2019s mean position.\nHere, the objections I raised against Copernicus concerning the ordering of the physical motion are also not clearly in agreement with Ptolemy. For the center of the epicycle which accounts for the second inequality, here just as the planet itself previously, is borne slowly or swiftly according to its approach  to or recession from the earth \u039a, performed on the circle \u03a7\u0396. Furthermore, to stipulate that there is in the earth \u039a (just as there was before in Copernicus\u2019s sun, the heart of the world) a motive force that drives the centers of this kind of epicycle around, is absurd and monstrous. The hypothesis can also be discredited by another physical argument. For intrinsic to this form of hypothesis, in one way or another, is solidity of the orbs; and since this has been destroyed (by Tycho Brahe\u2019s observations of comets), the hypothesis appears, so to speak, to collapse under its own weight. For a moving force would be declared to reside in the center of the epicycle (not in a body, but in a mathematical point), and to rouse itself to move from place to place, by an unequal amount in equal times; but at the same time would draw the planet along with itself at the distance of the epicycle\u2019s diameter; all the while causing the planet to gyrate around itself, by equal amounts in equal times. That this enormous variety cannot fall to a single moving mind (unless it be God), Aristotle gives supporting arguments in the Metaphysics Book XII Ch. 8: he holds that the individual minds preside over individual, perfectly uniform and simple circular motions. Besides, how will some power sit in a non-body, and flow out of the non-body into the planet? Even if you divide up the tasks, and locate one motive intelligence at the center of the epicycle and another in the body of the planet, the one at the center will use the earth (a body, of course) as its reference, and will move around the earth nonuniformly in a circle, while the one at a point on the circumference (that is, in the planet's body) will move around an incorporeal center and do so uniformly. The question, then, is (as before), by what aids would it move around the incorporeal point? Not by geometrical imagination, for it does not admit of geometrical imagination of itself. Nor can a mobile point subsist in a non-body even in imagination. We humans, in imagining points of this sort, have recourse to the aids of tablets or paper, which we draw upon with our hands or at least remember ourselves to have drawn once. But it likewise cannot happen through a physical flowing of power (which is in the center of the epicycle) out to the circumference and the planet\u2019s body. For we have submitted to this outflow of power on the supposition that the tasks of the compound motions are divided between two minds. Why not also question whether in the first, eccentric motion, some natural force constituted to produce motion might subsist in some point entirely devoid of any body? And even more, whether this kind of incorporeal power can move itself around the earth, and go from place to place? And most of all, whether it can communicate or transfer another's motion through an efflux from itself, although it is not supported by any body that could serve as its nest? Those sublime considerations of the essence, motion, place, and operations of the blessed angels and of separate minds which some people will want to raise in opposition to me, are irrelevant. For we are arguing about natural things which are far inferior in dignity, about powers that exercise no choice of how to vary their action, and about minds which are not in the least separate, since they are yoked and bound to the celestial bodies which they are to bear. These, then, are the general objections that can be raised against  Ptolemy. \nBut something further may be said to Ptolemy, on account of which in particular he would wish to abandon his mean position of the sun and embrace the apparent with us. For if the power moving the planet (whether single or double) acts with respect to the sun, so that it places the planet at the lowest point of the epicycle whenever the center of the epicycle is opposite the sun, I ask (as above) why it looks to the imaginary point \u03a5 (which sometimes precedes and sometimes follows the sun, here marked \u03a3, and is sometimes above and sometimes below it), rather than the sun's body itself? Or how it is that that power can have any perception whatever of the motion of \u03a5 around the earth K, since there is no body at \u03a8? Is it not more probable that the epicycle is restored to the lines \u039a\u03a3 of the sun\u2019s apparent position, when these pass through the center of the epicycle?\n Let us then see what is changed on the eccentric by substitution of the sun\u2019s apparent position. Again (as before) when the sun \u0393, the center of the sun\u2019s eccentric \u03a8, and the earth \u039a are on the same line, so that the line of the sun\u2019s apparent position \u03a8\u0393 and the line of its mean position \u039a\u0393 coincide, then for the center of the epicycle \u03a4 this place remains the same, whether its sidereal position is designated by \u039a\u03a4 or by \u03a8\u03a4, and the planet is really on the line \u039a\u03a4 or \u03a8\u03a4 and at the lowest point on its epicycle \u03a6, since here it is nearest to both \u03a8 and \u039a. The planet is thereby truly divested of its second inequality. But when the sun comes to the side of its eccentric (that is, to the middle distances), a great enough difference arises. For let the sun have gone from \u0393 to \u03a3, and the line of the sun\u2019s mean position \u039a\u03a5 be found in Aries, and the planet\u2019s line of vision \u039a\u03a9 precisely opposite in Libra, so that \u03a5\u039a\u03a9 is a single line. Now since  Ptolemy declared that the planet \u03a9 on this line of vision \u039a\u03a9 is divested of its second inequality, he places the center of the epicycle \u0396 on the line \u039a\u03a9. But since \u039a\u03a3 has gone beyond \u039a\u03a5, the sun\u2019s apparent position is beyond opposition to the planet. And in the last part of the time, \u039a\u03a9 is not descending, so as to be opposite \u039a\u03a3, but ascends towards \u039a\u03a6, because the lowest parts of the epicycle \u03a9 are retrograde and swifter than the center \u0396, and it is there, of course, that the planet is at opposition to the sun. Therefore, this apparent opposition precedes the mean one.\nTherefore, at some time preceding the moment designated by \u039a\u03a5 (let it be \u039a\u0398) when the sun is seen on the line \u039a\u039e, the planet will be seen opposite it (suppose it to be at \u0399) on \u039a\u0399 which forms a straight line with \u039a\u039e. Also, because it is now laid down that it sheds the second inequality at this true opposition, the center of the epicycle will also be seen on this line \u039e\u039a, say at \u039f. And because the planet is retrograde, at the time \u039a\u0398 prior to \u039a\u03a5 the planet is on the line \u039a\u0399 later than at \u039a\u03a9. But \u039a\u0399 and \u039a\u03a9 are parts of the lines \u039a\u039f and \u039a\u0396. Therefore, \u039a\u039f too is more to the east than \u039a\u0396.\nThus it is clear what would be changed on the line of the epicycle\u2019s center by this restoration from the sun\u2019s mean position to its apparent position. For at \u03a4 and the opposite point on the original line the motions of the epicycle\u2019s center remain unchanged. At \u0396 this line, and the center of the epicycle upon it, is moved forward and a subtraction is made from the intervening time. At the opposite place the contrary happens: an addition is made to the time, and the line of motion of the center of the epicycle is moved back westward. And thus these lines of the center of the epicycle differ much from the original lines. For this reason also, when we investigate the causes and measure of the first inequality by a new and repeated operation using these several observed positions of the center of the epicycle (that is, using the observed positions of the planet, after which we suppose the center of the epicycle to lie upon the same line), the outcome of this operation differs much from that of the preceding one. That is, since the time in the semicircle containing the apogee will have been diminished, so that the planet is correspondingly faster, the eccentricity of the equant will come out smaller. And since in the greater quadrant \u0392\u0396 of the semicircle containing the apogee the time will have been diminished by an amount equal to the diminution in the other, smaller part, the planet has been made proportionally much faster in the remaining part of the semicircle. Therefore, the perigee has come closer to the latter, and the apogee has descended from \u03a7 towards \u0396.\nThe quantification of the new hypothesis will be made clear thus. It is presupposed that the planet \u03a9 falls on the line drawn from the center of the epicycle \u0396 through the earth \u039a, only when \u039a\u0396 is collinear with \u039a\u03a3, the sun\u2019s apparent position. Therefore, \u039a\u03a3 and the line drawn from \u0396 through the body of the planet always proceed in parallel. Moreover, we have just taken it from Ptolemy that at the time when the line of the sun\u2019s mean position was \u039a\u03a5, drawn through \u03a9, the planet was observed on the line \u039a\u03a9, and nonetheless we do not grant him that the center of the epicycle \u0396 is on \u039a\u03a9 at the same time. Therefore, in accord with our position, let a line be drawn from the planet\u2019s position \u03a9 parallel to \u039a\u03a3, and let this be \u03a9\u039f. We are supposing that the center of the epicycle is at this moment on the line \u03a9\u039f, or some other line nearby and parallel, according as \u03a9 (representing the planet) is closer to or farther from \u039a on the line \u039a\u0396. Let \u03a9\u039f be drawn from whatever point on the line \u039a\u0396 (now, it is \u03a9), equal to \u03a9\u0396. From \u039f let a line be drawn to \u0396\u039a parallel to \u039a\u03a8, and let this be \u039f\u0396. Now since \u0396\u03a9\u039f is equal to \u039a\u03a3\u03a8, and \u039a\u03a3 is imperceptibly greater than \u03a8\u03a3  or \u03a9\u039f (because \u039a\u03a8\u03a3 is right, and the angle at \u03a3 is not greater than 2\u00b0 3\u2019, so that if \u03a8\u03a3 is 100,000, \u039a\u03a3 is 100,064), \u039f\u0396 is also imperceptibly less than \u039a\u03a8. Let \u0396\u0394 be joined, and let a line be drawn at \u039f parallel to \u0396\u0394. Now the moment of time at which the center of the epicycle is placed at \u0396 by Ptolemy and at \u039f by me, is the same, and is designated by both of us by the line \u039a\u03a5 in the theory of the sun. In the theory of Mars, that moment should be designated in the former theory by \u0396\u0394, because \u0394 is the point of equality, while in the new theory it will be designated by a line parallel to \u0396\u0394. Therefore, there will be a new point of equality, about which the time is counted, on this parallel through \u039f.

Again (as before) when the sun \u0393, the center of the sun\u2019s eccentric \u03a8, and the earth \u039a are on the same line, so that the line of the sun\u2019s apparent position \u03a8\u0393 and the line of its mean position \u039a\u0393 coincide, then for the center of the epicycle \u03a4 this place remains the same, whether its sidereal position is designated by \u039a\u03a4 or by \u03a8\u03a4, and the planet is really on the line \u039a\u03a4 or \u03a8\u03a4 and at the lowest point on its epicycle \u03a6, since here it is nearest to both \u03a8 and \u039a.

Now since  Ptolemy declared that the planet \u03a9 on this line of vision \u039a\u03a9 is divested of its second inequality, he places the center of the epicycle \u0396 on the line \u039a\u03a9. But since \u039a\u03a3 has gone beyond \u039a\u03a5, the sun\u2019s apparent position is beyond opposition to the planet. And in the last part of the time, \u039a\u03a9 is not descending, so as to be opposite \u039a\u03a3, but ascends towards \u039a\u03a6, because the lowest parts of the epicycle \u03a9 are retrograde and swifter than the center \u0396, and it is there, of course, that the planet is at opposition to the sun. Therefore, this apparent opposition precedes the mean one.\nTherefore, at some time preceding the moment designated by \u039a\u03a5 (let it be \u039a\u0398) when the sun is seen on the line \u039a\u039e, the planet will be seen opposite it (suppose it to be at \u0399) on \u039a\u0399 which forms a straight line with \u039a\u039e. Also, because it is now laid down that it sheds the second inequality at this true opposition, the center of the epicycle will also be seen on this line \u039e\u039a, say at \u039f. And because the planet is retrograde, at the time \u039a\u0398 prior to \u039a\u03a5 the planet is on the line \u039a\u0399 later than at \u039a\u03a9. But \u039a\u0399 and \u039a\u03a9 are parts of the lines \u039a\u039f and \u039a\u0396. Therefore, \u039a\u039f too is more to the east than \u039a\u0396.\nThus it is clear what would be changed on the line of the epicycle\u2019s center by this restoration from the sun\u2019s mean position to its apparent position. For at \u03a4 and the opposite point on the original line the motions of the epicycle\u2019s center remain unchanged. At \u0396 this line, and the center of the epicycle upon it, is moved forward and a subtraction is made from the intervening time. At the opposite place the contrary happens: an addition is made to the time, and the line of motion of the center of the epicycle is moved back westward. And thus these lines of the center of the epicycle differ much from the original lines. For this reason also, when we investigate the causes and measure of the first inequality by a new and repeated operation using these several observed positions of the center of the epicycle (that is, using the observed positions of the planet, after which we suppose the center of the epicycle to lie upon the same line), the outcome of this operation differs much from that of the preceding one. That is, since the time in the semicircle containing the apogee will have been diminished, so that the planet is correspondingly faster, the eccentricity of the equant will come out smaller. And since in the greater quadrant \u0392\u0396 of the semicircle containing the apogee the time will have been diminished by an amount equal to the diminution in the other, smaller part, the planet has been made proportionally much faster in the remaining part of the semicircle. Therefore, the perigee has come closer to the latter, and the apogee has descended from \u03a7 towards \u0396.\nThe quantification of the new hypothesis will be made clear thus. It is presupposed that the planet \u03a9 falls on the line drawn from the center of the epicycle \u0396 through the earth \u039a, only when \u039a\u0396 is collinear with \u039a\u03a3, the sun\u2019s apparent position. Therefore, \u039a\u03a3 and the line drawn from \u0396 through the body of the planet always proceed in parallel. Moreover, we have just taken it from Ptolemy that at the time when the line of the sun\u2019s mean position was \u039a\u03a5, drawn through \u03a9, the planet was observed on the line \u039a\u03a9, and nonetheless we do not grant him that the center of the epicycle \u0396 is on \u039a\u03a9 at the same time. Therefore, in accord with our position, let a line be drawn from the planet\u2019s position \u03a9 parallel to \u039a\u03a3, and let this be \u03a9\u039f. We are supposing that the center of the epicycle is at this moment on the line \u03a9\u039f, or some other line nearby and parallel, according as \u03a9 (representing the planet) is closer to or farther from \u039a on the line \u039a\u0396. Let \u03a9\u039f be drawn from whatever point on the line \u039a\u0396 (now, it is \u03a9), equal to \u03a9\u0396. From \u039f let a line be drawn to \u0396\u039a parallel to \u039a\u03a8, and let this be \u039f\u0396. Now since \u0396\u03a9\u039f is equal to \u039a\u03a3\u03a8, and \u039a\u03a3 is imperceptibly greater than \u03a8\u03a3  or \u03a9\u039f (because \u039a\u03a8\u03a3 is right, and the angle at \u03a3 is not greater than 2\u00b0 3\u2019, so that if \u03a8\u03a3 is 100,000, \u039a\u03a3 is 100,064), \u039f\u0396 is also imperceptibly less than \u039a\u03a8. Let \u0396\u0394 be joined, and let a line be drawn at \u039f parallel to \u0396\u0394. Now the moment of time at which the center of the epicycle is placed at \u0396 by Ptolemy and at \u039f by me, is the same, and is designated by both of us by the line \u039a\u03a5 in the theory of the sun. In the theory of Mars, that moment should be designated in the former theory by \u0396\u0394, because \u0394 is the point of equality, while in the new theory it will be designated by a line parallel to \u0396\u0394. Therefore, there will be a new point of equality, about which the time is counted, on this parallel through \u039f. ","691":"Now Ptolemy measured out the courses of the planets, not on the lines \u039a\u03a3, but on the lines \u039a\u03a5 drawn from \u039a parallel to the lines \u03a8\u03a3 passing through the sun\u2019s body. For whenever the planet fell upon these lines \u039a\u03a5 on the side opposite the sun, it was supposed to have shed its second inequality, which fell to it (in Ptolemy\u2019s opinion) because of the epicycle. Then the planet\u2019s sidereal position was sought out by means of instruments, and the center of the epicycle was supposed to be found at that time on the same line. This was done a number of times and at various places on the zodiac: say, \u039a\u0393, \u039a\u03a5, and the points opposite. From three such positions of the planet (or of the center of the epicycle, which, according to Ptolemy, accounts for the second inequality), the practitioner sets out to investigate the hypothesis for the first inequality by comparing these angles which the observed positions form about \u039a, the center of the earth and of observation, with the intervening times. The method for this enterprise is found in Ptolemy Book IX ^19. Now suppose the treatment done, and let the eccentric's line of apsides come out to be \u039a\u039b\u0394\u03a7, with \u0394 the equalizing point, the center of the eccentric upon this line and at point \u039b, and the eccentric \u03a7\u0396. And let this hypothesis correspond to all positions observed at the times of the planet\u2019s opposition to the sun\u2019s mean position.\nHere, the objections I raised against Copernicus concerning the ordering of the physical motion are also not clearly in agreement with Ptolemy. For the center of the epicycle which accounts for the second inequality, here just as the planet itself previously, is borne slowly or swiftly according to its approach  to or recession from the earth \u039a, performed on the circle \u03a7\u0396. Furthermore, to stipulate that there is in the earth \u039a (just as there was before in Copernicus\u2019s sun, the heart of the world) a motive force that drives the centers of this kind of epicycle around, is absurd and monstrous. The hypothesis can also be discredited by another physical argument. For intrinsic to this form of hypothesis, in one way or another, is solidity of the orbs; and since this has been destroyed (by Tycho Brahe\u2019s observations of comets), the hypothesis appears, so to speak, to collapse under its own weight. For a moving force would be declared to reside in the center of the epicycle (not in a body, but in a mathematical point), and to rouse itself to move from place to place, by an unequal amount in equal times; but at the same time would draw the planet along with itself at the distance of the epicycle\u2019s diameter; all the while causing the planet to gyrate around itself, by equal amounts in equal times. That this enormous variety cannot fall to a single moving mind (unless it be God), Aristotle gives supporting arguments in the Metaphysics Book XII Ch. 8: he holds that the individual minds preside over individual, perfectly uniform and simple circular motions. Besides, how will some power sit in a non-body, and flow out of the non-body into the planet? Even if you divide up the tasks, and locate one motive intelligence at the center of the epicycle and another in the body of the planet, the one at the center will use the earth (a body, of course) as its reference, and will move around the earth nonuniformly in a circle, while the one at a point on the circumference (that is, in the planet's body) will move around an incorporeal center and do so uniformly. The question, then, is (as before), by what aids would it move around the incorporeal point? Not by geometrical imagination, for it does not admit of geometrical imagination of itself. Nor can a mobile point subsist in a non-body even in imagination. We humans, in imagining points of this sort, have recourse to the aids of tablets or paper, which we draw upon with our hands or at least remember ourselves to have drawn once. But it likewise cannot happen through a physical flowing of power (which is in the center of the epicycle) out to the circumference and the planet\u2019s body. For we have submitted to this outflow of power on the supposition that the tasks of the compound motions are divided between two minds. Why not also question whether in the first, eccentric motion, some natural force constituted to produce motion might subsist in some point entirely devoid of any body? And even more, whether this kind of incorporeal power can move itself around the earth, and go from place to place? And most of all, whether it can communicate or transfer another's motion through an efflux from itself, although it is not supported by any body that could serve as its nest? Those sublime considerations of the essence, motion, place, and operations of the blessed angels and of separate minds which some people will want to raise in opposition to me, are irrelevant. For we are arguing about natural things which are far inferior in dignity, about powers that exercise no choice of how to vary their action, and about minds which are not in the least separate, since they are yoked and bound to the celestial bodies which they are to bear. These, then, are the general objections that can be raised against  Ptolemy. \nBut something further may be said to Ptolemy, on account of which in particular he would wish to abandon his mean position of the sun and embrace the apparent with us. For if the power moving the planet (whether single or double) acts with respect to the sun, so that it places the planet at the lowest point of the epicycle whenever the center of the epicycle is opposite the sun, I ask (as above) why it looks to the imaginary point \u03a5 (which sometimes precedes and sometimes follows the sun, here marked \u03a3, and is sometimes above and sometimes below it), rather than the sun's body itself? Or how it is that that power can have any perception whatever of the motion of \u03a5 around the earth K, since there is no body at \u03a8? Is it not more probable that the epicycle is restored to the lines \u039a\u03a3 of the sun\u2019s apparent position, when these pass through the center of the epicycle?\n Let us then see what is changed on the eccentric by substitution of the sun\u2019s apparent position. Again (as before) when the sun \u0393, the center of the sun\u2019s eccentric \u03a8, and the earth \u039a are on the same line, so that the line of the sun\u2019s apparent position \u03a8\u0393 and the line of its mean position \u039a\u0393 coincide, then for the center of the epicycle \u03a4 this place remains the same, whether its sidereal position is designated by \u039a\u03a4 or by \u03a8\u03a4, and the planet is really on the line \u039a\u03a4 or \u03a8\u03a4 and at the lowest point on its epicycle \u03a6, since here it is nearest to both \u03a8 and \u039a. The planet is thereby truly divested of its second inequality. But when the sun comes to the side of its eccentric (that is, to the middle distances), a great enough difference arises. For let the sun have gone from \u0393 to \u03a3, and the line of the sun\u2019s mean position \u039a\u03a5 be found in Aries, and the planet\u2019s line of vision \u039a\u03a9 precisely opposite in Libra, so that \u03a5\u039a\u03a9 is a single line. Now since  Ptolemy declared that the planet \u03a9 on this line of vision \u039a\u03a9 is divested of its second inequality, he places the center of the epicycle \u0396 on the line \u039a\u03a9. But since \u039a\u03a3 has gone beyond \u039a\u03a5, the sun\u2019s apparent position is beyond opposition to the planet. And in the last part of the time, \u039a\u03a9 is not descending, so as to be opposite \u039a\u03a3, but ascends towards \u039a\u03a6, because the lowest parts of the epicycle \u03a9 are retrograde and swifter than the center \u0396, and it is there, of course, that the planet is at opposition to the sun. Therefore, this apparent opposition precedes the mean one.\nTherefore, at some time preceding the moment designated by \u039a\u03a5 (let it be \u039a\u0398) when the sun is seen on the line \u039a\u039e, the planet will be seen opposite it (suppose it to be at \u0399) on \u039a\u0399 which forms a straight line with \u039a\u039e. Also, because it is now laid down that it sheds the second inequality at this true opposition, the center of the epicycle will also be seen on this line \u039e\u039a, say at \u039f. And because the planet is retrograde, at the time \u039a\u0398 prior to \u039a\u03a5 the planet is on the line \u039a\u0399 later than at \u039a\u03a9. But \u039a\u0399 and \u039a\u03a9 are parts of the lines \u039a\u039f and \u039a\u0396. Therefore, \u039a\u039f too is more to the east than \u039a\u0396.\nThus it is clear what would be changed on the line of the epicycle\u2019s center by this restoration from the sun\u2019s mean position to its apparent position. For at \u03a4 and the opposite point on the original line the motions of the epicycle\u2019s center remain unchanged. At \u0396 this line, and the center of the epicycle upon it, is moved forward and a subtraction is made from the intervening time. At the opposite place the contrary happens: an addition is made to the time, and the line of motion of the center of the epicycle is moved back westward. And thus these lines of the center of the epicycle differ much from the original lines. For this reason also, when we investigate the causes and measure of the first inequality by a new and repeated operation using these several observed positions of the center of the epicycle (that is, using the observed positions of the planet, after which we suppose the center of the epicycle to lie upon the same line), the outcome of this operation differs much from that of the preceding one. That is, since the time in the semicircle containing the apogee will have been diminished, so that the planet is correspondingly faster, the eccentricity of the equant will come out smaller. And since in the greater quadrant \u0392\u0396 of the semicircle containing the apogee the time will have been diminished by an amount equal to the diminution in the other, smaller part, the planet has been made proportionally much faster in the remaining part of the semicircle. Therefore, the perigee has come closer to the latter, and the apogee has descended from \u03a7 towards \u0396.\nThe quantification of the new hypothesis will be made clear thus. It is presupposed that the planet \u03a9 falls on the line drawn from the center of the epicycle \u0396 through the earth \u039a, only when \u039a\u0396 is collinear with \u039a\u03a3, the sun\u2019s apparent position. Therefore, \u039a\u03a3 and the line drawn from \u0396 through the body of the planet always proceed in parallel. Moreover, we have just taken it from Ptolemy that at the time when the line of the sun\u2019s mean position was \u039a\u03a5, drawn through \u03a9, the planet was observed on the line \u039a\u03a9, and nonetheless we do not grant him that the center of the epicycle \u0396 is on \u039a\u03a9 at the same time. Therefore, in accord with our position, let a line be drawn from the planet\u2019s position \u03a9 parallel to \u039a\u03a3, and let this be \u03a9\u039f. We are supposing that the center of the epicycle is at this moment on the line \u03a9\u039f, or some other line nearby and parallel, according as \u03a9 (representing the planet) is closer to or farther from \u039a on the line \u039a\u0396. Let \u03a9\u039f be drawn from whatever point on the line \u039a\u0396 (now, it is \u03a9), equal to \u03a9\u0396. From \u039f let a line be drawn to \u0396\u039a parallel to \u039a\u03a8, and let this be \u039f\u0396. Now since \u0396\u03a9\u039f is equal to \u039a\u03a3\u03a8, and \u039a\u03a3 is imperceptibly greater than \u03a8\u03a3  or \u03a9\u039f (because \u039a\u03a8\u03a3 is right, and the angle at \u03a3 is not greater than 2\u00b0 3\u2019, so that if \u03a8\u03a3 is 100,000, \u039a\u03a3 is 100,064), \u039f\u0396 is also imperceptibly less than \u039a\u03a8. Let \u0396\u0394 be joined, and let a line be drawn at \u039f parallel to \u0396\u0394. Now the moment of time at which the center of the epicycle is placed at \u0396 by Ptolemy and at \u039f by me, is the same, and is designated by both of us by the line \u039a\u03a5 in the theory of the sun. In the theory of Mars, that moment should be designated in the former theory by \u0396\u0394, because \u0394 is the point of equality, while in the new theory it will be designated by a line parallel to \u0396\u0394. Therefore, there will be a new point of equality, about which the time is counted, on this parallel through \u039f. ","692":"Now Ptolemy measured out the courses of the planets, not on the lines \u039a\u03a3, but on the lines \u039a\u03a5 drawn from \u039a parallel to the lines \u03a8\u03a3 passing through the sun\u2019s body.

Is it not more probable that the epicycle is restored to the lines \u039a\u03a3 of the sun\u2019s apparent position, when these pass through the center of the epicycle?\n Let us then see what is changed on the eccentric by substitution of the sun\u2019s apparent position. Again (as before) when the sun \u0393, the center of the sun\u2019s eccentric \u03a8, and the earth \u039a are on the same line, so that the line of the sun\u2019s apparent position \u03a8\u0393 and the line of its mean position \u039a\u0393 coincide, then for the center of the epicycle \u03a4 this place remains the same, whether its sidereal position is designated by \u039a\u03a4 or by \u03a8\u03a4, and the planet is really on the line \u039a\u03a4 or \u03a8\u03a4 and at the lowest point on its epicycle \u03a6, since here it is nearest to both \u03a8 and \u039a. The planet is thereby truly divested of its second inequality. But when the sun comes to the side of its eccentric (that is, to the middle distances), a great enough difference arises. For let the sun have gone from \u0393 to \u03a3, and the line of the sun\u2019s mean position \u039a\u03a5 be found in Aries, and the planet\u2019s line of vision \u039a\u03a9 precisely opposite in Libra, so that \u03a5\u039a\u03a9 is a single line. Now since  Ptolemy declared that the planet \u03a9 on this line of vision \u039a\u03a9 is divested of its second inequality, he places the center of the epicycle \u0396 on the line \u039a\u03a9. But since \u039a\u03a3 has gone beyond \u039a\u03a5, the sun\u2019s apparent position is beyond opposition to the planet. And in the last part of the time, \u039a\u03a9 is not descending, so as to be opposite \u039a\u03a3, but ascends towards \u039a\u03a6, because the lowest parts of the epicycle \u03a9 are retrograde and swifter than the center \u0396, and it is there, of course, that the planet is at opposition to the sun. Therefore, this apparent opposition precedes the mean one.\nTherefore, at some time preceding the moment designated by \u039a\u03a5 (let it be \u039a\u0398) when the sun is seen on the line \u039a\u039e, the planet will be seen opposite it (suppose it to be at \u0399) on \u039a\u0399 which forms a straight line with \u039a\u039e. Also, because it is now laid down that it sheds the second inequality at this true opposition, the center of the epicycle will also be seen on this line \u039e\u039a, say at \u039f. And because the planet is retrograde, at the time \u039a\u0398 prior to \u039a\u03a5 the planet is on the line \u039a\u0399 later than at \u039a\u03a9. But \u039a\u0399 and \u039a\u03a9 are parts of the lines \u039a\u039f and \u039a\u0396. Therefore, \u039a\u039f too is more to the east than \u039a\u0396.\nThus it is clear what would be changed on the line of the epicycle\u2019s center by this restoration from the sun\u2019s mean position to its apparent position. For at \u03a4 and the opposite point on the original line the motions of the epicycle\u2019s center remain unchanged. At \u0396 this line, and the center of the epicycle upon it, is moved forward and a subtraction is made from the intervening time. At the opposite place the contrary happens: an addition is made to the time, and the line of motion of the center of the epicycle is moved back westward. And thus these lines of the center of the epicycle differ much from the original lines. For this reason also, when we investigate the causes and measure of the first inequality by a new and repeated operation using these several observed positions of the center of the epicycle (that is, using the observed positions of the planet, after which we suppose the center of the epicycle to lie upon the same line), the outcome of this operation differs much from that of the preceding one. That is, since the time in the semicircle containing the apogee will have been diminished, so that the planet is correspondingly faster, the eccentricity of the equant will come out smaller. And since in the greater quadrant \u0392\u0396 of the semicircle containing the apogee the time will have been diminished by an amount equal to the diminution in the other, smaller part, the planet has been made proportionally much faster in the remaining part of the semicircle. Therefore, the perigee has come closer to the latter, and the apogee has descended from \u03a7 towards \u0396.\nThe quantification of the new hypothesis will be made clear thus. It is presupposed that the planet \u03a9 falls on the line drawn from the center of the epicycle \u0396 through the earth \u039a, only when \u039a\u0396 is collinear with \u039a\u03a3, the sun\u2019s apparent position. Therefore, \u039a\u03a3 and the line drawn from \u0396 through the body of the planet always proceed in parallel. Moreover, we have just taken it from Ptolemy that at the time when the line of the sun\u2019s mean position was \u039a\u03a5, drawn through \u03a9, the planet was observed on the line \u039a\u03a9, and nonetheless we do not grant him that the center of the epicycle \u0396 is on \u039a\u03a9 at the same time. Therefore, in accord with our position, let a line be drawn from the planet\u2019s position \u03a9 parallel to \u039a\u03a3, and let this be \u03a9\u039f. We are supposing that the center of the epicycle is at this moment on the line \u03a9\u039f, or some other line nearby and parallel, according as \u03a9 (representing the planet) is closer to or farther from \u039a on the line \u039a\u0396. Let \u03a9\u039f be drawn from whatever point on the line \u039a\u0396 (now, it is \u03a9), equal to \u03a9\u0396. From \u039f let a line be drawn to \u0396\u039a parallel to \u039a\u03a8, and let this be \u039f\u0396. Now since \u0396\u03a9\u039f is equal to \u039a\u03a3\u03a8, and \u039a\u03a3 is imperceptibly greater than \u03a8\u03a3  or \u03a9\u039f (because \u039a\u03a8\u03a3 is right, and the angle at \u03a3 is not greater than 2\u00b0 3\u2019, so that if \u03a8\u03a3 is 100,000, \u039a\u03a3 is 100,064), \u039f\u0396 is also imperceptibly less than \u039a\u03a8. Let \u0396\u0394 be joined, and let a line be drawn at \u039f parallel to \u0396\u0394. Now the moment of time at which the center of the epicycle is placed at \u0396 by Ptolemy and at \u039f by me, is the same, and is designated by both of us by the line \u039a\u03a5 in the theory of the sun. In the theory of Mars, that moment should be designated in the former theory by \u0396\u0394, because \u0394 is the point of equality, while in the new theory it will be designated by a line parallel to \u0396\u0394. Therefore, there will be a new point of equality, about which the time is counted, on this parallel through \u039f. ","693":"Now Ptolemy measured out the courses of the planets, not on the lines \u039a\u03a3, but on the lines \u039a\u03a5 drawn from \u039a parallel to the lines \u03a8\u03a3 passing through the sun\u2019s body. For whenever the planet fell upon these lines \u039a\u03a5 on the side opposite the sun, it was supposed to have shed its second inequality, which fell to it (in Ptolemy\u2019s opinion) because of the epicycle. Then the planet\u2019s sidereal position was sought out by means of instruments, and the center of the epicycle was supposed to be found at that time on the same line. This was done a number of times and at various places on the zodiac: say, \u039a\u0393, \u039a\u03a5, and the points opposite. From three such positions of the planet (or of the center of the epicycle, which, according to Ptolemy, accounts for the second inequality), the practitioner sets out to investigate the hypothesis for the first inequality by comparing these angles which the observed positions form about \u039a, the center of the earth and of observation, with the intervening times. The method for this enterprise is found in Ptolemy Book IX ^19. Now suppose the treatment done, and let the eccentric's line of apsides come out to be \u039a\u039b\u0394\u03a7, with \u0394 the equalizing point, the center of the eccentric upon this line and at point \u039b, and the eccentric \u03a7\u0396. And let this hypothesis correspond to all positions observed at the times of the planet\u2019s opposition to the sun\u2019s mean position.\nHere, the objections I raised against Copernicus concerning the ordering of the physical motion are also not clearly in agreement with Ptolemy. For the center of the epicycle which accounts for the second inequality, here just as the planet itself previously, is borne slowly or swiftly according to its approach  to or recession from the earth \u039a, performed on the circle \u03a7\u0396. Furthermore, to stipulate that there is in the earth \u039a (just as there was before in Copernicus\u2019s sun, the heart of the world) a motive force that drives the centers of this kind of epicycle around, is absurd and monstrous. The hypothesis can also be discredited by another physical argument. For intrinsic to this form of hypothesis, in one way or another, is solidity of the orbs; and since this has been destroyed (by Tycho Brahe\u2019s observations of comets), the hypothesis appears, so to speak, to collapse under its own weight. For a moving force would be declared to reside in the center of the epicycle (not in a body, but in a mathematical point), and to rouse itself to move from place to place, by an unequal amount in equal times; but at the same time would draw the planet along with itself at the distance of the epicycle\u2019s diameter; all the while causing the planet to gyrate around itself, by equal amounts in equal times. That this enormous variety cannot fall to a single moving mind (unless it be God), Aristotle gives supporting arguments in the Metaphysics Book XII Ch. 8: he holds that the individual minds preside over individual, perfectly uniform and simple circular motions. Besides, how will some power sit in a non-body, and flow out of the non-body into the planet? Even if you divide up the tasks, and locate one motive intelligence at the center of the epicycle and another in the body of the planet, the one at the center will use the earth (a body, of course) as its reference, and will move around the earth nonuniformly in a circle, while the one at a point on the circumference (that is, in the planet's body) will move around an incorporeal center and do so uniformly. The question, then, is (as before), by what aids would it move around the incorporeal point? Not by geometrical imagination, for it does not admit of geometrical imagination of itself. Nor can a mobile point subsist in a non-body even in imagination. We humans, in imagining points of this sort, have recourse to the aids of tablets or paper, which we draw upon with our hands or at least remember ourselves to have drawn once. But it likewise cannot happen through a physical flowing of power (which is in the center of the epicycle) out to the circumference and the planet\u2019s body. For we have submitted to this outflow of power on the supposition that the tasks of the compound motions are divided between two minds. Why not also question whether in the first, eccentric motion, some natural force constituted to produce motion might subsist in some point entirely devoid of any body? And even more, whether this kind of incorporeal power can move itself around the earth, and go from place to place? And most of all, whether it can communicate or transfer another's motion through an efflux from itself, although it is not supported by any body that could serve as its nest? Those sublime considerations of the essence, motion, place, and operations of the blessed angels and of separate minds which some people will want to raise in opposition to me, are irrelevant. For we are arguing about natural things which are far inferior in dignity, about powers that exercise no choice of how to vary their action, and about minds which are not in the least separate, since they are yoked and bound to the celestial bodies which they are to bear. These, then, are the general objections that can be raised against  Ptolemy. \nBut something further may be said to Ptolemy, on account of which in particular he would wish to abandon his mean position of the sun and embrace the apparent with us. For if the power moving the planet (whether single or double) acts with respect to the sun, so that it places the planet at the lowest point of the epicycle whenever the center of the epicycle is opposite the sun, I ask (as above) why it looks to the imaginary point \u03a5 (which sometimes precedes and sometimes follows the sun, here marked \u03a3, and is sometimes above and sometimes below it), rather than the sun's body itself? Or how it is that that power can have any perception whatever of the motion of \u03a5 around the earth K, since there is no body at \u03a8? Is it not more probable that the epicycle is restored to the lines \u039a\u03a3 of the sun\u2019s apparent position, when these pass through the center of the epicycle?\n Let us then see what is changed on the eccentric by substitution of the sun\u2019s apparent position. Again (as before) when the sun \u0393, the center of the sun\u2019s eccentric \u03a8, and the earth \u039a are on the same line, so that the line of the sun\u2019s apparent position \u03a8\u0393 and the line of its mean position \u039a\u0393 coincide, then for the center of the epicycle \u03a4 this place remains the same, whether its sidereal position is designated by \u039a\u03a4 or by \u03a8\u03a4, and the planet is really on the line \u039a\u03a4 or \u03a8\u03a4 and at the lowest point on its epicycle \u03a6, since here it is nearest to both \u03a8 and \u039a. The planet is thereby truly divested of its second inequality. But when the sun comes to the side of its eccentric (that is, to the middle distances), a great enough difference arises. For let the sun have gone from \u0393 to \u03a3, and the line of the sun\u2019s mean position \u039a\u03a5 be found in Aries, and the planet\u2019s line of vision \u039a\u03a9 precisely opposite in Libra, so that \u03a5\u039a\u03a9 is a single line. Now since  Ptolemy declared that the planet \u03a9 on this line of vision \u039a\u03a9 is divested of its second inequality, he places the center of the epicycle \u0396 on the line \u039a\u03a9. But since \u039a\u03a3 has gone beyond \u039a\u03a5, the sun\u2019s apparent position is beyond opposition to the planet. And in the last part of the time, \u039a\u03a9 is not descending, so as to be opposite \u039a\u03a3, but ascends towards \u039a\u03a6, because the lowest parts of the epicycle \u03a9 are retrograde and swifter than the center \u0396, and it is there, of course, that the planet is at opposition to the sun. Therefore, this apparent opposition precedes the mean one.\nTherefore, at some time preceding the moment designated by \u039a\u03a5 (let it be \u039a\u0398) when the sun is seen on the line \u039a\u039e, the planet will be seen opposite it (suppose it to be at \u0399) on \u039a\u0399 which forms a straight line with \u039a\u039e. Also, because it is now laid down that it sheds the second inequality at this true opposition, the center of the epicycle will also be seen on this line \u039e\u039a, say at \u039f. And because the planet is retrograde, at the time \u039a\u0398 prior to \u039a\u03a5 the planet is on the line \u039a\u0399 later than at \u039a\u03a9. But \u039a\u0399 and \u039a\u03a9 are parts of the lines \u039a\u039f and \u039a\u0396. Therefore, \u039a\u039f too is more to the east than \u039a\u0396.\nThus it is clear what would be changed on the line of the epicycle\u2019s center by this restoration from the sun\u2019s mean position to its apparent position. For at \u03a4 and the opposite point on the original line the motions of the epicycle\u2019s center remain unchanged. At \u0396 this line, and the center of the epicycle upon it, is moved forward and a subtraction is made from the intervening time. At the opposite place the contrary happens: an addition is made to the time, and the line of motion of the center of the epicycle is moved back westward. And thus these lines of the center of the epicycle differ much from the original lines. For this reason also, when we investigate the causes and measure of the first inequality by a new and repeated operation using these several observed positions of the center of the epicycle (that is, using the observed positions of the planet, after which we suppose the center of the epicycle to lie upon the same line), the outcome of this operation differs much from that of the preceding one. That is, since the time in the semicircle containing the apogee will have been diminished, so that the planet is correspondingly faster, the eccentricity of the equant will come out smaller. And since in the greater quadrant \u0392\u0396 of the semicircle containing the apogee the time will have been diminished by an amount equal to the diminution in the other, smaller part, the planet has been made proportionally much faster in the remaining part of the semicircle. Therefore, the perigee has come closer to the latter, and the apogee has descended from \u03a7 towards \u0396.\nThe quantification of the new hypothesis will be made clear thus. It is presupposed that the planet \u03a9 falls on the line drawn from the center of the epicycle \u0396 through the earth \u039a, only when \u039a\u0396 is collinear with \u039a\u03a3, the sun\u2019s apparent position. Therefore, \u039a\u03a3 and the line drawn from \u0396 through the body of the planet always proceed in parallel. Moreover, we have just taken it from Ptolemy that at the time when the line of the sun\u2019s mean position was \u039a\u03a5, drawn through \u03a9, the planet was observed on the line \u039a\u03a9, and nonetheless we do not grant him that the center of the epicycle \u0396 is on \u039a\u03a9 at the same time. Therefore, in accord with our position, let a line be drawn from the planet\u2019s position \u03a9 parallel to \u039a\u03a3, and let this be \u03a9\u039f. We are supposing that the center of the epicycle is at this moment on the line \u03a9\u039f, or some other line nearby and parallel, according as \u03a9 (representing the planet) is closer to or farther from \u039a on the line \u039a\u0396. Let \u03a9\u039f be drawn from whatever point on the line \u039a\u0396 (now, it is \u03a9), equal to \u03a9\u0396. From \u039f let a line be drawn to \u0396\u039a parallel to \u039a\u03a8, and let this be \u039f\u0396. Now since \u0396\u03a9\u039f is equal to \u039a\u03a3\u03a8, and \u039a\u03a3 is imperceptibly greater than \u03a8\u03a3  or \u03a9\u039f (because \u039a\u03a8\u03a3 is right, and the angle at \u03a3 is not greater than 2\u00b0 3\u2019, so that if \u03a8\u03a3 is 100,000, \u039a\u03a3 is 100,064), \u039f\u0396 is also imperceptibly less than \u039a\u03a8. Let \u0396\u0394 be joined, and let a line be drawn at \u039f parallel to \u0396\u0394. Now the moment of time at which the center of the epicycle is placed at \u0396 by Ptolemy and at \u039f by me, is the same, and is designated by both of us by the line \u039a\u03a5 in the theory of the sun. In the theory of Mars, that moment should be designated in the former theory by \u0396\u0394, because \u0394 is the point of equality, while in the new theory it will be designated by a line parallel to \u0396\u0394. Therefore, there will be a new point of equality, about which the time is counted, on this parallel through \u039f. ","694":"Now Ptolemy measured out the courses of the planets, not on the lines \u039a\u03a3, but on the lines \u039a\u03a5 drawn from \u039a parallel to the lines \u03a8\u03a3 passing through the sun\u2019s body.

Is it not more probable that the epicycle is restored to the lines \u039a\u03a3 of the sun\u2019s apparent position, when these pass through the center of the epicycle?\n Let us then see what is changed on the eccentric by substitution of the sun\u2019s apparent position. Again (as before) when the sun \u0393, the center of the sun\u2019s eccentric \u03a8, and the earth \u039a are on the same line, so that the line of the sun\u2019s apparent position \u03a8\u0393 and the line of its mean position \u039a\u0393 coincide, then for the center of the epicycle \u03a4 this place remains the same, whether its sidereal position is designated by \u039a\u03a4 or by \u03a8\u03a4, and the planet is really on the line \u039a\u03a4 or \u03a8\u03a4 and at the lowest point on its epicycle \u03a6, since here it is nearest to both \u03a8 and \u039a. The planet is thereby truly divested of its second inequality. But when the sun comes to the side of its eccentric (that is, to the middle distances), a great enough difference arises. For let the sun have gone from \u0393 to \u03a3, and the line of the sun\u2019s mean position \u039a\u03a5 be found in Aries, and the planet\u2019s line of vision \u039a\u03a9 precisely opposite in Libra, so that \u03a5\u039a\u03a9 is a single line. Now since  Ptolemy declared that the planet \u03a9 on this line of vision \u039a\u03a9 is divested of its second inequality, he places the center of the epicycle \u0396 on the line \u039a\u03a9. But since \u039a\u03a3 has gone beyond \u039a\u03a5, the sun\u2019s apparent position is beyond opposition to the planet. And in the last part of the time, \u039a\u03a9 is not descending, so as to be opposite \u039a\u03a3, but ascends towards \u039a\u03a6, because the lowest parts of the epicycle \u03a9 are retrograde and swifter than the center \u0396, and it is there, of course, that the planet is at opposition to the sun. Therefore, this apparent opposition precedes the mean one.\nTherefore, at some time preceding the moment designated by \u039a\u03a5 (let it be \u039a\u0398) when the sun is seen on the line \u039a\u039e, the planet will be seen opposite it (suppose it to be at \u0399) on \u039a\u0399 which forms a straight line with \u039a\u039e. Also, because it is now laid down that it sheds the second inequality at this true opposition, the center of the epicycle will also be seen on this line \u039e\u039a, say at \u039f. And because the planet is retrograde, at the time \u039a\u0398 prior to \u039a\u03a5 the planet is on the line \u039a\u0399 later than at \u039a\u03a9. But \u039a\u0399 and \u039a\u03a9 are parts of the lines \u039a\u039f and \u039a\u0396. Therefore, \u039a\u039f too is more to the east than \u039a\u0396.\nThus it is clear what would be changed on the line of the epicycle\u2019s center by this restoration from the sun\u2019s mean position to its apparent position. For at \u03a4 and the opposite point on the original line the motions of the epicycle\u2019s center remain unchanged. At \u0396 this line, and the center of the epicycle upon it, is moved forward and a subtraction is made from the intervening time. At the opposite place the contrary happens: an addition is made to the time, and the line of motion of the center of the epicycle is moved back westward. And thus these lines of the center of the epicycle differ much from the original lines. For this reason also, when we investigate the causes and measure of the first inequality by a new and repeated operation using these several observed positions of the center of the epicycle (that is, using the observed positions of the planet, after which we suppose the center of the epicycle to lie upon the same line), the outcome of this operation differs much from that of the preceding one. That is, since the time in the semicircle containing the apogee will have been diminished, so that the planet is correspondingly faster, the eccentricity of the equant will come out smaller. And since in the greater quadrant \u0392\u0396 of the semicircle containing the apogee the time will have been diminished by an amount equal to the diminution in the other, smaller part, the planet has been made proportionally much faster in the remaining part of the semicircle. Therefore, the perigee has come closer to the latter, and the apogee has descended from \u03a7 towards \u0396.\nThe quantification of the new hypothesis will be made clear thus. It is presupposed that the planet \u03a9 falls on the line drawn from the center of the epicycle \u0396 through the earth \u039a, only when \u039a\u0396 is collinear with \u039a\u03a3, the sun\u2019s apparent position. Therefore, \u039a\u03a3 and the line drawn from \u0396 through the body of the planet always proceed in parallel. Moreover, we have just taken it from Ptolemy that at the time when the line of the sun\u2019s mean position was \u039a\u03a5, drawn through \u03a9, the planet was observed on the line \u039a\u03a9, and nonetheless we do not grant him that the center of the epicycle \u0396 is on \u039a\u03a9 at the same time. Therefore, in accord with our position, let a line be drawn from the planet\u2019s position \u03a9 parallel to \u039a\u03a3, and let this be \u03a9\u039f. We are supposing that the center of the epicycle is at this moment on the line \u03a9\u039f, or some other line nearby and parallel, according as \u03a9 (representing the planet) is closer to or farther from \u039a on the line \u039a\u0396. Let \u03a9\u039f be drawn from whatever point on the line \u039a\u0396 (now, it is \u03a9), equal to \u03a9\u0396. From \u039f let a line be drawn to \u0396\u039a parallel to \u039a\u03a8, and let this be \u039f\u0396. Now since \u0396\u03a9\u039f is equal to \u039a\u03a3\u03a8, and \u039a\u03a3 is imperceptibly greater than \u03a8\u03a3  or \u03a9\u039f (because \u039a\u03a8\u03a3 is right, and the angle at \u03a3 is not greater than 2\u00b0 3\u2019, so that if \u03a8\u03a3 is 100,000, \u039a\u03a3 is 100,064), \u039f\u0396 is also imperceptibly less than \u039a\u03a8. Let \u0396\u0394 be joined, and let a line be drawn at \u039f parallel to \u0396\u0394. Now the moment of time at which the center of the epicycle is placed at \u0396 by Ptolemy and at \u039f by me, is the same, and is designated by both of us by the line \u039a\u03a5 in the theory of the sun. In the theory of Mars, that moment should be designated in the former theory by \u0396\u0394, because \u0394 is the point of equality, while in the new theory it will be designated by a line parallel to \u0396\u0394. Therefore, there will be a new point of equality, about which the time is counted, on this parallel through \u039f. ","695":"Now Ptolemy measured out the courses of the planets, not on the lines \u039a\u03a3, but on the lines \u039a\u03a5 drawn from \u039a parallel to the lines \u03a8\u03a3 passing through the sun\u2019s body. For whenever the planet fell upon these lines \u039a\u03a5 on the side opposite the sun, it was supposed to have shed its second inequality, which fell to it (in Ptolemy\u2019s opinion) because of the epicycle. Then the planet\u2019s sidereal position was sought out by means of instruments, and the center of the epicycle was supposed to be found at that time on the same line. This was done a number of times and at various places on the zodiac: say, \u039a\u0393, \u039a\u03a5, and the points opposite. From three such positions of the planet (or of the center of the epicycle, which, according to Ptolemy, accounts for the second inequality), the practitioner sets out to investigate the hypothesis for the first inequality by comparing these angles which the observed positions form about \u039a, the center of the earth and of observation, with the intervening times. The method for this enterprise is found in Ptolemy Book IX ^19. Now suppose the treatment done, and let the eccentric's line of apsides come out to be \u039a\u039b\u0394\u03a7, with \u0394 the equalizing point, the center of the eccentric upon this line and at point \u039b, and the eccentric \u03a7\u0396. And let this hypothesis correspond to all positions observed at the times of the planet\u2019s opposition to the sun\u2019s mean position.\nHere, the objections I raised against Copernicus concerning the ordering of the physical motion are also not clearly in agreement with Ptolemy. For the center of the epicycle which accounts for the second inequality, here just as the planet itself previously, is borne slowly or swiftly according to its approach  to or recession from the earth \u039a, performed on the circle \u03a7\u0396. Furthermore, to stipulate that there is in the earth \u039a (just as there was before in Copernicus\u2019s sun, the heart of the world) a motive force that drives the centers of this kind of epicycle around, is absurd and monstrous. The hypothesis can also be discredited by another physical argument. For intrinsic to this form of hypothesis, in one way or another, is solidity of the orbs; and since this has been destroyed (by Tycho Brahe\u2019s observations of comets), the hypothesis appears, so to speak, to collapse under its own weight. For a moving force would be declared to reside in the center of the epicycle (not in a body, but in a mathematical point), and to rouse itself to move from place to place, by an unequal amount in equal times; but at the same time would draw the planet along with itself at the distance of the epicycle\u2019s diameter; all the while causing the planet to gyrate around itself, by equal amounts in equal times. That this enormous variety cannot fall to a single moving mind (unless it be God), Aristotle gives supporting arguments in the Metaphysics Book XII Ch. 8: he holds that the individual minds preside over individual, perfectly uniform and simple circular motions. Besides, how will some power sit in a non-body, and flow out of the non-body into the planet? Even if you divide up the tasks, and locate one motive intelligence at the center of the epicycle and another in the body of the planet, the one at the center will use the earth (a body, of course) as its reference, and will move around the earth nonuniformly in a circle, while the one at a point on the circumference (that is, in the planet's body) will move around an incorporeal center and do so uniformly. The question, then, is (as before), by what aids would it move around the incorporeal point? Not by geometrical imagination, for it does not admit of geometrical imagination of itself. Nor can a mobile point subsist in a non-body even in imagination. We humans, in imagining points of this sort, have recourse to the aids of tablets or paper, which we draw upon with our hands or at least remember ourselves to have drawn once. But it likewise cannot happen through a physical flowing of power (which is in the center of the epicycle) out to the circumference and the planet\u2019s body. For we have submitted to this outflow of power on the supposition that the tasks of the compound motions are divided between two minds. Why not also question whether in the first, eccentric motion, some natural force constituted to produce motion might subsist in some point entirely devoid of any body? And even more, whether this kind of incorporeal power can move itself around the earth, and go from place to place? And most of all, whether it can communicate or transfer another's motion through an efflux from itself, although it is not supported by any body that could serve as its nest? Those sublime considerations of the essence, motion, place, and operations of the blessed angels and of separate minds which some people will want to raise in opposition to me, are irrelevant. For we are arguing about natural things which are far inferior in dignity, about powers that exercise no choice of how to vary their action, and about minds which are not in the least separate, since they are yoked and bound to the celestial bodies which they are to bear. These, then, are the general objections that can be raised against  Ptolemy. \nBut something further may be said to Ptolemy, on account of which in particular he would wish to abandon his mean position of the sun and embrace the apparent with us. For if the power moving the planet (whether single or double) acts with respect to the sun, so that it places the planet at the lowest point of the epicycle whenever the center of the epicycle is opposite the sun, I ask (as above) why it looks to the imaginary point \u03a5 (which sometimes precedes and sometimes follows the sun, here marked \u03a3, and is sometimes above and sometimes below it), rather than the sun's body itself? Or how it is that that power can have any perception whatever of the motion of \u03a5 around the earth K, since there is no body at \u03a8? Is it not more probable that the epicycle is restored to the lines \u039a\u03a3 of the sun\u2019s apparent position, when these pass through the center of the epicycle?\n Let us then see what is changed on the eccentric by substitution of the sun\u2019s apparent position. Again (as before) when the sun \u0393, the center of the sun\u2019s eccentric \u03a8, and the earth \u039a are on the same line, so that the line of the sun\u2019s apparent position \u03a8\u0393 and the line of its mean position \u039a\u0393 coincide, then for the center of the epicycle \u03a4 this place remains the same, whether its sidereal position is designated by \u039a\u03a4 or by \u03a8\u03a4, and the planet is really on the line \u039a\u03a4 or \u03a8\u03a4 and at the lowest point on its epicycle \u03a6, since here it is nearest to both \u03a8 and \u039a. The planet is thereby truly divested of its second inequality. But when the sun comes to the side of its eccentric (that is, to the middle distances), a great enough difference arises. For let the sun have gone from \u0393 to \u03a3, and the line of the sun\u2019s mean position \u039a\u03a5 be found in Aries, and the planet\u2019s line of vision \u039a\u03a9 precisely opposite in Libra, so that \u03a5\u039a\u03a9 is a single line. Now since  Ptolemy declared that the planet \u03a9 on this line of vision \u039a\u03a9 is divested of its second inequality, he places the center of the epicycle \u0396 on the line \u039a\u03a9. But since \u039a\u03a3 has gone beyond \u039a\u03a5, the sun\u2019s apparent position is beyond opposition to the planet. And in the last part of the time, \u039a\u03a9 is not descending, so as to be opposite \u039a\u03a3, but ascends towards \u039a\u03a6, because the lowest parts of the epicycle \u03a9 are retrograde and swifter than the center \u0396, and it is there, of course, that the planet is at opposition to the sun. Therefore, this apparent opposition precedes the mean one.\nTherefore, at some time preceding the moment designated by \u039a\u03a5 (let it be \u039a\u0398) when the sun is seen on the line \u039a\u039e, the planet will be seen opposite it (suppose it to be at \u0399) on \u039a\u0399 which forms a straight line with \u039a\u039e. Also, because it is now laid down that it sheds the second inequality at this true opposition, the center of the epicycle will also be seen on this line \u039e\u039a, say at \u039f. And because the planet is retrograde, at the time \u039a\u0398 prior to \u039a\u03a5 the planet is on the line \u039a\u0399 later than at \u039a\u03a9. But \u039a\u0399 and \u039a\u03a9 are parts of the lines \u039a\u039f and \u039a\u0396. Therefore, \u039a\u039f too is more to the east than \u039a\u0396.\nThus it is clear what would be changed on the line of the epicycle\u2019s center by this restoration from the sun\u2019s mean position to its apparent position. For at \u03a4 and the opposite point on the original line the motions of the epicycle\u2019s center remain unchanged. At \u0396 this line, and the center of the epicycle upon it, is moved forward and a subtraction is made from the intervening time. At the opposite place the contrary happens: an addition is made to the time, and the line of motion of the center of the epicycle is moved back westward. And thus these lines of the center of the epicycle differ much from the original lines. For this reason also, when we investigate the causes and measure of the first inequality by a new and repeated operation using these several observed positions of the center of the epicycle (that is, using the observed positions of the planet, after which we suppose the center of the epicycle to lie upon the same line), the outcome of this operation differs much from that of the preceding one. That is, since the time in the semicircle containing the apogee will have been diminished, so that the planet is correspondingly faster, the eccentricity of the equant will come out smaller. And since in the greater quadrant \u0392\u0396 of the semicircle containing the apogee the time will have been diminished by an amount equal to the diminution in the other, smaller part, the planet has been made proportionally much faster in the remaining part of the semicircle. Therefore, the perigee has come closer to the latter, and the apogee has descended from \u03a7 towards \u0396.\nThe quantification of the new hypothesis will be made clear thus. It is presupposed that the planet \u03a9 falls on the line drawn from the center of the epicycle \u0396 through the earth \u039a, only when \u039a\u0396 is collinear with \u039a\u03a3, the sun\u2019s apparent position. Therefore, \u039a\u03a3 and the line drawn from \u0396 through the body of the planet always proceed in parallel. Moreover, we have just taken it from Ptolemy that at the time when the line of the sun\u2019s mean position was \u039a\u03a5, drawn through \u03a9, the planet was observed on the line \u039a\u03a9, and nonetheless we do not grant him that the center of the epicycle \u0396 is on \u039a\u03a9 at the same time. Therefore, in accord with our position, let a line be drawn from the planet\u2019s position \u03a9 parallel to \u039a\u03a3, and let this be \u03a9\u039f. We are supposing that the center of the epicycle is at this moment on the line \u03a9\u039f, or some other line nearby and parallel, according as \u03a9 (representing the planet) is closer to or farther from \u039a on the line \u039a\u0396. Let \u03a9\u039f be drawn from whatever point on the line \u039a\u0396 (now, it is \u03a9), equal to \u03a9\u0396. From \u039f let a line be drawn to \u0396\u039a parallel to \u039a\u03a8, and let this be \u039f\u0396. Now since \u0396\u03a9\u039f is equal to \u039a\u03a3\u03a8, and \u039a\u03a3 is imperceptibly greater than \u03a8\u03a3  or \u03a9\u039f (because \u039a\u03a8\u03a3 is right, and the angle at \u03a3 is not greater than 2\u00b0 3\u2019, so that if \u03a8\u03a3 is 100,000, \u039a\u03a3 is 100,064), \u039f\u0396 is also imperceptibly less than \u039a\u03a8. Let \u0396\u0394 be joined, and let a line be drawn at \u039f parallel to \u0396\u0394. Now the moment of time at which the center of the epicycle is placed at \u0396 by Ptolemy and at \u039f by me, is the same, and is designated by both of us by the line \u039a\u03a5 in the theory of the sun. In the theory of Mars, that moment should be designated in the former theory by \u0396\u0394, because \u0394 is the point of equality, while in the new theory it will be designated by a line parallel to \u0396\u0394. Therefore, there will be a new point of equality, about which the time is counted, on this parallel through \u039f. ","696":"Now Ptolemy measured out the courses of the planets, not on the lines \u039a\u03a3, but on the lines \u039a\u03a5 drawn from \u039a parallel to the lines \u03a8\u03a3 passing through the sun\u2019s body.

Again (as before) when the sun \u0393, the center of the sun\u2019s eccentric \u03a8, and the earth \u039a are on the same line, so that the line of the sun\u2019s apparent position \u03a8\u0393 and the line of its mean position \u039a\u0393 coincide, then for the center of the epicycle \u03a4 this place remains the same, whether its sidereal position is designated by \u039a\u03a4 or by \u03a8\u03a4, and the planet is really on the line \u039a\u03a4 or \u03a8\u03a4 and at the lowest point on its epicycle \u03a6, since here it is nearest to both \u03a8 and \u039a. The planet is thereby truly divested of its second inequality. But when the sun comes to the side of its eccentric (that is, to the middle distances), a great enough difference arises.

Now since  Ptolemy declared that the planet \u03a9 on this line of vision \u039a\u03a9 is divested of its second inequality, he places the center of the epicycle \u0396 on the line \u039a\u03a9. But since \u039a\u03a3 has gone beyond \u039a\u03a5, the sun\u2019s apparent position is beyond opposition to the planet. And in the last part of the time, \u039a\u03a9 is not descending, so as to be opposite \u039a\u03a3, but ascends towards \u039a\u03a6, because the lowest parts of the epicycle \u03a9 are retrograde and swifter than the center \u0396, and it is there, of course, that the planet is at opposition to the sun. Therefore, this apparent opposition precedes the mean one.\nTherefore, at some time preceding the moment designated by \u039a\u03a5 (let it be \u039a\u0398) when the sun is seen on the line \u039a\u039e, the planet will be seen opposite it (suppose it to be at \u0399) on \u039a\u0399 which forms a straight line with \u039a\u039e. Also, because it is now laid down that it sheds the second inequality at this true opposition, the center of the epicycle will also be seen on this line \u039e\u039a, say at \u039f. And because the planet is retrograde, at the time \u039a\u0398 prior to \u039a\u03a5 the planet is on the line \u039a\u0399 later than at \u039a\u03a9. But \u039a\u0399 and \u039a\u03a9 are parts of the lines \u039a\u039f and \u039a\u0396. Therefore, \u039a\u039f too is more to the east than \u039a\u0396.\nThus it is clear what would be changed on the line of the epicycle\u2019s center by this restoration from the sun\u2019s mean position to its apparent position. For at \u03a4 and the opposite point on the original line the motions of the epicycle\u2019s center remain unchanged. At \u0396 this line, and the center of the epicycle upon it, is moved forward and a subtraction is made from the intervening time. At the opposite place the contrary happens: an addition is made to the time, and the line of motion of the center of the epicycle is moved back westward. And thus these lines of the center of the epicycle differ much from the original lines.

Therefore, the perigee has come closer to the latter, and the apogee has descended from \u03a7 towards \u0396.\nThe quantification of the new hypothesis will be made clear thus. It is presupposed that the planet \u03a9 falls on the line drawn from the center of the epicycle \u0396 through the earth \u039a, only when \u039a\u0396 is collinear with \u039a\u03a3, the sun\u2019s apparent position. Therefore, \u039a\u03a3 and the line drawn from \u0396 through the body of the planet always proceed in parallel. Moreover, we have just taken it from Ptolemy that at the time when the line of the sun\u2019s mean position was \u039a\u03a5, drawn through \u03a9, the planet was observed on the line \u039a\u03a9, and nonetheless we do not grant him that the center of the epicycle \u0396 is on \u039a\u03a9 at the same time. Therefore, in accord with our position, let a line be drawn from the planet\u2019s position \u03a9 parallel to \u039a\u03a3, and let this be \u03a9\u039f. We are supposing that the center of the epicycle is at this moment on the line \u03a9\u039f, or some other line nearby and parallel, according as \u03a9 (representing the planet) is closer to or farther from \u039a on the line \u039a\u0396. Let \u03a9\u039f be drawn from whatever point on the line \u039a\u0396 (now, it is \u03a9), equal to \u03a9\u0396. From \u039f let a line be drawn to \u0396\u039a parallel to \u039a\u03a8, and let this be \u039f\u0396. Now since \u0396\u03a9\u039f is equal to \u039a\u03a3\u03a8, and \u039a\u03a3 is imperceptibly greater than \u03a8\u03a3  or \u03a9\u039f (because \u039a\u03a8\u03a3 is right, and the angle at \u03a3 is not greater than 2\u00b0 3\u2019, so that if \u03a8\u03a3 is 100,000, \u039a\u03a3 is 100,064), \u039f\u0396 is also imperceptibly less than \u039a\u03a8. Let \u0396\u0394 be joined, and let a line be drawn at \u039f parallel to \u0396\u0394. Now the moment of time at which the center of the epicycle is placed at \u0396 by Ptolemy and at \u039f by me, is the same, and is designated by both of us by the line \u039a\u03a5 in the theory of the sun. In the theory of Mars, that moment should be designated in the former theory by \u0396\u0394, because \u0394 is the point of equality, while in the new theory it will be designated by a line parallel to \u0396\u0394. Therefore, there will be a new point of equality, about which the time is counted, on this parallel through \u039f. ","697":"Now Ptolemy measured out the courses of the planets, not on the lines \u039a\u03a3, but on the lines \u039a\u03a5 drawn from \u039a parallel to the lines \u03a8\u03a3 passing through the sun\u2019s body. For whenever the planet fell upon these lines \u039a\u03a5 on the side opposite the sun, it was supposed to have shed its second inequality, which fell to it (in Ptolemy\u2019s opinion) because of the epicycle. Then the planet\u2019s sidereal position was sought out by means of instruments, and the center of the epicycle was supposed to be found at that time on the same line. This was done a number of times and at various places on the zodiac: say, \u039a\u0393, \u039a\u03a5, and the points opposite. From three such positions of the planet (or of the center of the epicycle, which, according to Ptolemy, accounts for the second inequality), the practitioner sets out to investigate the hypothesis for the first inequality by comparing these angles which the observed positions form about \u039a, the center of the earth and of observation, with the intervening times. The method for this enterprise is found in Ptolemy Book IX ^19. Now suppose the treatment done, and let the eccentric's line of apsides come out to be \u039a\u039b\u0394\u03a7, with \u0394 the equalizing point, the center of the eccentric upon this line and at point \u039b, and the eccentric \u03a7\u0396. And let this hypothesis correspond to all positions observed at the times of the planet\u2019s opposition to the sun\u2019s mean position.\nHere, the objections I raised against Copernicus concerning the ordering of the physical motion are also not clearly in agreement with Ptolemy. For the center of the epicycle which accounts for the second inequality, here just as the planet itself previously, is borne slowly or swiftly according to its approach  to or recession from the earth \u039a, performed on the circle \u03a7\u0396. Furthermore, to stipulate that there is in the earth \u039a (just as there was before in Copernicus\u2019s sun, the heart of the world) a motive force that drives the centers of this kind of epicycle around, is absurd and monstrous. The hypothesis can also be discredited by another physical argument. For intrinsic to this form of hypothesis, in one way or another, is solidity of the orbs; and since this has been destroyed (by Tycho Brahe\u2019s observations of comets), the hypothesis appears, so to speak, to collapse under its own weight. For a moving force would be declared to reside in the center of the epicycle (not in a body, but in a mathematical point), and to rouse itself to move from place to place, by an unequal amount in equal times; but at the same time would draw the planet along with itself at the distance of the epicycle\u2019s diameter; all the while causing the planet to gyrate around itself, by equal amounts in equal times. That this enormous variety cannot fall to a single moving mind (unless it be God), Aristotle gives supporting arguments in the Metaphysics Book XII Ch. 8: he holds that the individual minds preside over individual, perfectly uniform and simple circular motions. Besides, how will some power sit in a non-body, and flow out of the non-body into the planet? Even if you divide up the tasks, and locate one motive intelligence at the center of the epicycle and another in the body of the planet, the one at the center will use the earth (a body, of course) as its reference, and will move around the earth nonuniformly in a circle, while the one at a point on the circumference (that is, in the planet's body) will move around an incorporeal center and do so uniformly. The question, then, is (as before), by what aids would it move around the incorporeal point? Not by geometrical imagination, for it does not admit of geometrical imagination of itself. Nor can a mobile point subsist in a non-body even in imagination. We humans, in imagining points of this sort, have recourse to the aids of tablets or paper, which we draw upon with our hands or at least remember ourselves to have drawn once. But it likewise cannot happen through a physical flowing of power (which is in the center of the epicycle) out to the circumference and the planet\u2019s body. For we have submitted to this outflow of power on the supposition that the tasks of the compound motions are divided between two minds. Why not also question whether in the first, eccentric motion, some natural force constituted to produce motion might subsist in some point entirely devoid of any body? And even more, whether this kind of incorporeal power can move itself around the earth, and go from place to place? And most of all, whether it can communicate or transfer another's motion through an efflux from itself, although it is not supported by any body that could serve as its nest? Those sublime considerations of the essence, motion, place, and operations of the blessed angels and of separate minds which some people will want to raise in opposition to me, are irrelevant. For we are arguing about natural things which are far inferior in dignity, about powers that exercise no choice of how to vary their action, and about minds which are not in the least separate, since they are yoked and bound to the celestial bodies which they are to bear. These, then, are the general objections that can be raised against  Ptolemy. \nBut something further may be said to Ptolemy, on account of which in particular he would wish to abandon his mean position of the sun and embrace the apparent with us. For if the power moving the planet (whether single or double) acts with respect to the sun, so that it places the planet at the lowest point of the epicycle whenever the center of the epicycle is opposite the sun, I ask (as above) why it looks to the imaginary point \u03a5 (which sometimes precedes and sometimes follows the sun, here marked \u03a3, and is sometimes above and sometimes below it), rather than the sun's body itself? Or how it is that that power can have any perception whatever of the motion of \u03a5 around the earth K, since there is no body at \u03a8? Is it not more probable that the epicycle is restored to the lines \u039a\u03a3 of the sun\u2019s apparent position, when these pass through the center of the epicycle?\n Let us then see what is changed on the eccentric by substitution of the sun\u2019s apparent position. Again (as before) when the sun \u0393, the center of the sun\u2019s eccentric \u03a8, and the earth \u039a are on the same line, so that the line of the sun\u2019s apparent position \u03a8\u0393 and the line of its mean position \u039a\u0393 coincide, then for the center of the epicycle \u03a4 this place remains the same, whether its sidereal position is designated by \u039a\u03a4 or by \u03a8\u03a4, and the planet is really on the line \u039a\u03a4 or \u03a8\u03a4 and at the lowest point on its epicycle \u03a6, since here it is nearest to both \u03a8 and \u039a. The planet is thereby truly divested of its second inequality. But when the sun comes to the side of its eccentric (that is, to the middle distances), a great enough difference arises. For let the sun have gone from \u0393 to \u03a3, and the line of the sun\u2019s mean position \u039a\u03a5 be found in Aries, and the planet\u2019s line of vision \u039a\u03a9 precisely opposite in Libra, so that \u03a5\u039a\u03a9 is a single line. Now since  Ptolemy declared that the planet \u03a9 on this line of vision \u039a\u03a9 is divested of its second inequality, he places the center of the epicycle \u0396 on the line \u039a\u03a9. But since \u039a\u03a3 has gone beyond \u039a\u03a5, the sun\u2019s apparent position is beyond opposition to the planet. And in the last part of the time, \u039a\u03a9 is not descending, so as to be opposite \u039a\u03a3, but ascends towards \u039a\u03a6, because the lowest parts of the epicycle \u03a9 are retrograde and swifter than the center \u0396, and it is there, of course, that the planet is at opposition to the sun. Therefore, this apparent opposition precedes the mean one.\nTherefore, at some time preceding the moment designated by \u039a\u03a5 (let it be \u039a\u0398) when the sun is seen on the line \u039a\u039e, the planet will be seen opposite it (suppose it to be at \u0399) on \u039a\u0399 which forms a straight line with \u039a\u039e. Also, because it is now laid down that it sheds the second inequality at this true opposition, the center of the epicycle will also be seen on this line \u039e\u039a, say at \u039f. And because the planet is retrograde, at the time \u039a\u0398 prior to \u039a\u03a5 the planet is on the line \u039a\u0399 later than at \u039a\u03a9. But \u039a\u0399 and \u039a\u03a9 are parts of the lines \u039a\u039f and \u039a\u0396. Therefore, \u039a\u039f too is more to the east than \u039a\u0396.\nThus it is clear what would be changed on the line of the epicycle\u2019s center by this restoration from the sun\u2019s mean position to its apparent position. For at \u03a4 and the opposite point on the original line the motions of the epicycle\u2019s center remain unchanged. At \u0396 this line, and the center of the epicycle upon it, is moved forward and a subtraction is made from the intervening time. At the opposite place the contrary happens: an addition is made to the time, and the line of motion of the center of the epicycle is moved back westward. And thus these lines of the center of the epicycle differ much from the original lines. For this reason also, when we investigate the causes and measure of the first inequality by a new and repeated operation using these several observed positions of the center of the epicycle (that is, using the observed positions of the planet, after which we suppose the center of the epicycle to lie upon the same line), the outcome of this operation differs much from that of the preceding one. That is, since the time in the semicircle containing the apogee will have been diminished, so that the planet is correspondingly faster, the eccentricity of the equant will come out smaller. And since in the greater quadrant \u0392\u0396 of the semicircle containing the apogee the time will have been diminished by an amount equal to the diminution in the other, smaller part, the planet has been made proportionally much faster in the remaining part of the semicircle. Therefore, the perigee has come closer to the latter, and the apogee has descended from \u03a7 towards \u0396.\nThe quantification of the new hypothesis will be made clear thus. It is presupposed that the planet \u03a9 falls on the line drawn from the center of the epicycle \u0396 through the earth \u039a, only when \u039a\u0396 is collinear with \u039a\u03a3, the sun\u2019s apparent position. Therefore, \u039a\u03a3 and the line drawn from \u0396 through the body of the planet always proceed in parallel. Moreover, we have just taken it from Ptolemy that at the time when the line of the sun\u2019s mean position was \u039a\u03a5, drawn through \u03a9, the planet was observed on the line \u039a\u03a9, and nonetheless we do not grant him that the center of the epicycle \u0396 is on \u039a\u03a9 at the same time. Therefore, in accord with our position, let a line be drawn from the planet\u2019s position \u03a9 parallel to \u039a\u03a3, and let this be \u03a9\u039f. We are supposing that the center of the epicycle is at this moment on the line \u03a9\u039f, or some other line nearby and parallel, according as \u03a9 (representing the planet) is closer to or farther from \u039a on the line \u039a\u0396. Let \u03a9\u039f be drawn from whatever point on the line \u039a\u0396 (now, it is \u03a9), equal to \u03a9\u0396. From \u039f let a line be drawn to \u0396\u039a parallel to \u039a\u03a8, and let this be \u039f\u0396. Now since \u0396\u03a9\u039f is equal to \u039a\u03a3\u03a8, and \u039a\u03a3 is imperceptibly greater than \u03a8\u03a3  or \u03a9\u039f (because \u039a\u03a8\u03a3 is right, and the angle at \u03a3 is not greater than 2\u00b0 3\u2019, so that if \u03a8\u03a3 is 100,000, \u039a\u03a3 is 100,064), \u039f\u0396 is also imperceptibly less than \u039a\u03a8. Let \u0396\u0394 be joined, and let a line be drawn at \u039f parallel to \u0396\u0394. Now the moment of time at which the center of the epicycle is placed at \u0396 by Ptolemy and at \u039f by me, is the same, and is designated by both of us by the line \u039a\u03a5 in the theory of the sun. In the theory of Mars, that moment should be designated in the former theory by \u0396\u0394, because \u0394 is the point of equality, while in the new theory it will be designated by a line parallel to \u0396\u0394. Therefore, there will be a new point of equality, about which the time is counted, on this parallel through \u039f. ","698":"Now Ptolemy measured out the courses of the planets, not on the lines \u039a\u03a3, but on the lines \u039a\u03a5 drawn from \u039a parallel to the lines \u03a8\u03a3 passing through the sun\u2019s body.

Again (as before) when the sun \u0393, the center of the sun\u2019s eccentric \u03a8, and the earth \u039a are on the same line, so that the line of the sun\u2019s apparent position \u03a8\u0393 and the line of its mean position \u039a\u0393 coincide, then for the center of the epicycle \u03a4 this place remains the same, whether its sidereal position is designated by \u039a\u03a4 or by \u03a8\u03a4, and the planet is really on the line \u039a\u03a4 or \u03a8\u03a4 and at the lowest point on its epicycle \u03a6, since here it is nearest to both \u03a8 and \u039a. The planet is thereby truly divested of its second inequality. But when the sun comes to the side of its eccentric (that is, to the middle distances), a great enough difference arises. For let the sun have gone from \u0393 to \u03a3, and the line of the sun\u2019s mean position \u039a\u03a5 be found in Aries, and the planet\u2019s line of vision \u039a\u03a9 precisely opposite in Libra, so that \u03a5\u039a\u03a9 is a single line. Now since  Ptolemy declared that the planet \u03a9 on this line of vision \u039a\u03a9 is divested of its second inequality, he places the center of the epicycle \u0396 on the line \u039a\u03a9. But since \u039a\u03a3 has gone beyond \u039a\u03a5, the sun\u2019s apparent position is beyond opposition to the planet. And in the last part of the time, \u039a\u03a9 is not descending, so as to be opposite \u039a\u03a3, but ascends towards \u039a\u03a6, because the lowest parts of the epicycle \u03a9 are retrograde and swifter than the center \u0396, and it is there, of course, that the planet is at opposition to the sun. Therefore, this apparent opposition precedes the mean one.\nTherefore, at some time preceding the moment designated by \u039a\u03a5 (let it be \u039a\u0398) when the sun is seen on the line \u039a\u039e, the planet will be seen opposite it (suppose it to be at \u0399) on \u039a\u0399 which forms a straight line with \u039a\u039e. Also, because it is now laid down that it sheds the second inequality at this true opposition, the center of the epicycle will also be seen on this line \u039e\u039a, say at \u039f. And because the planet is retrograde, at the time \u039a\u0398 prior to \u039a\u03a5 the planet is on the line \u039a\u0399 later than at \u039a\u03a9. But \u039a\u0399 and \u039a\u03a9 are parts of the lines \u039a\u039f and \u039a\u0396. Therefore, \u039a\u039f too is more to the east than \u039a\u0396.\nThus it is clear what would be changed on the line of the epicycle\u2019s center by this restoration from the sun\u2019s mean position to its apparent position. For at \u03a4 and the opposite point on the original line the motions of the epicycle\u2019s center remain unchanged. At \u0396 this line, and the center of the epicycle upon it, is moved forward and a subtraction is made from the intervening time. At the opposite place the contrary happens: an addition is made to the time, and the line of motion of the center of the epicycle is moved back westward. And thus these lines of the center of the epicycle differ much from the original lines.

That is, since the time in the semicircle containing the apogee will have been diminished, so that the planet is correspondingly faster, the eccentricity of the equant will come out smaller. And since in the greater quadrant \u0392\u0396 of the semicircle containing the apogee the time will have been diminished by an amount equal to the diminution in the other, smaller part, the planet has been made proportionally much faster in the remaining part of the semicircle. Therefore, the perigee has come closer to the latter, and the apogee has descended from \u03a7 towards \u0396.\nThe quantification of the new hypothesis will be made clear thus. It is presupposed that the planet \u03a9 falls on the line drawn from the center of the epicycle \u0396 through the earth \u039a, only when \u039a\u0396 is collinear with \u039a\u03a3, the sun\u2019s apparent position. Therefore, \u039a\u03a3 and the line drawn from \u0396 through the body of the planet always proceed in parallel. Moreover, we have just taken it from Ptolemy that at the time when the line of the sun\u2019s mean position was \u039a\u03a5, drawn through \u03a9, the planet was observed on the line \u039a\u03a9, and nonetheless we do not grant him that the center of the epicycle \u0396 is on \u039a\u03a9 at the same time. Therefore, in accord with our position, let a line be drawn from the planet\u2019s position \u03a9 parallel to \u039a\u03a3, and let this be \u03a9\u039f. We are supposing that the center of the epicycle is at this moment on the line \u03a9\u039f, or some other line nearby and parallel, according as \u03a9 (representing the planet) is closer to or farther from \u039a on the line \u039a\u0396. Let \u03a9\u039f be drawn from whatever point on the line \u039a\u0396 (now, it is \u03a9), equal to \u03a9\u0396. From \u039f let a line be drawn to \u0396\u039a parallel to \u039a\u03a8, and let this be \u039f\u0396. Now since \u0396\u03a9\u039f is equal to \u039a\u03a3\u03a8, and \u039a\u03a3 is imperceptibly greater than \u03a8\u03a3  or \u03a9\u039f (because \u039a\u03a8\u03a3 is right, and the angle at \u03a3 is not greater than 2\u00b0 3\u2019, so that if \u03a8\u03a3 is 100,000, \u039a\u03a3 is 100,064), \u039f\u0396 is also imperceptibly less than \u039a\u03a8. Let \u0396\u0394 be joined, and let a line be drawn at \u039f parallel to \u0396\u0394. Now the moment of time at which the center of the epicycle is placed at \u0396 by Ptolemy and at \u039f by me, is the same, and is designated by both of us by the line \u039a\u03a5 in the theory of the sun. In the theory of Mars, that moment should be designated in the former theory by \u0396\u0394, because \u0394 is the point of equality, while in the new theory it will be designated by a line parallel to \u0396\u0394. Therefore, there will be a new point of equality, about which the time is counted, on this parallel through \u039f. ","699":"Now Ptolemy measured out the courses of the planets, not on the lines \u039a\u03a3, but on the lines \u039a\u03a5 drawn from \u039a parallel to the lines \u03a8\u03a3 passing through the sun\u2019s body. For whenever the planet fell upon these lines \u039a\u03a5 on the side opposite the sun, it was supposed to have shed its second inequality, which fell to it (in Ptolemy\u2019s opinion) because of the epicycle. Then the planet\u2019s sidereal position was sought out by means of instruments, and the center of the epicycle was supposed to be found at that time on the same line. This was done a number of times and at various places on the zodiac: say, \u039a\u0393, \u039a\u03a5, and the points opposite. From three such positions of the planet (or of the center of the epicycle, which, according to Ptolemy, accounts for the second inequality), the practitioner sets out to investigate the hypothesis for the first inequality by comparing these angles which the observed positions form about \u039a, the center of the earth and of observation, with the intervening times. The method for this enterprise is found in Ptolemy Book IX ^19. Now suppose the treatment done, and let the eccentric's line of apsides come out to be \u039a\u039b\u0394\u03a7, with \u0394 the equalizing point, the center of the eccentric upon this line and at point \u039b, and the eccentric \u03a7\u0396. And let this hypothesis correspond to all positions observed at the times of the planet\u2019s opposition to the sun\u2019s mean position.\nHere, the objections I raised against Copernicus concerning the ordering of the physical motion are also not clearly in agreement with Ptolemy. For the center of the epicycle which accounts for the second inequality, here just as the planet itself previously, is borne slowly or swiftly according to its approach  to or recession from the earth \u039a, performed on the circle \u03a7\u0396. Furthermore, to stipulate that there is in the earth \u039a (just as there was before in Copernicus\u2019s sun, the heart of the world) a motive force that drives the centers of this kind of epicycle around, is absurd and monstrous. The hypothesis can also be discredited by another physical argument. For intrinsic to this form of hypothesis, in one way or another, is solidity of the orbs; and since this has been destroyed (by Tycho Brahe\u2019s observations of comets), the hypothesis appears, so to speak, to collapse under its own weight. For a moving force would be declared to reside in the center of the epicycle (not in a body, but in a mathematical point), and to rouse itself to move from place to place, by an unequal amount in equal times; but at the same time would draw the planet along with itself at the distance of the epicycle\u2019s diameter; all the while causing the planet to gyrate around itself, by equal amounts in equal times. That this enormous variety cannot fall to a single moving mind (unless it be God), Aristotle gives supporting arguments in the Metaphysics Book XII Ch. 8: he holds that the individual minds preside over individual, perfectly uniform and simple circular motions. Besides, how will some power sit in a non-body, and flow out of the non-body into the planet? Even if you divide up the tasks, and locate one motive intelligence at the center of the epicycle and another in the body of the planet, the one at the center will use the earth (a body, of course) as its reference, and will move around the earth nonuniformly in a circle, while the one at a point on the circumference (that is, in the planet's body) will move around an incorporeal center and do so uniformly. The question, then, is (as before), by what aids would it move around the incorporeal point? Not by geometrical imagination, for it does not admit of geometrical imagination of itself. Nor can a mobile point subsist in a non-body even in imagination. We humans, in imagining points of this sort, have recourse to the aids of tablets or paper, which we draw upon with our hands or at least remember ourselves to have drawn once. But it likewise cannot happen through a physical flowing of power (which is in the center of the epicycle) out to the circumference and the planet\u2019s body. For we have submitted to this outflow of power on the supposition that the tasks of the compound motions are divided between two minds. Why not also question whether in the first, eccentric motion, some natural force constituted to produce motion might subsist in some point entirely devoid of any body? And even more, whether this kind of incorporeal power can move itself around the earth, and go from place to place? And most of all, whether it can communicate or transfer another's motion through an efflux from itself, although it is not supported by any body that could serve as its nest? Those sublime considerations of the essence, motion, place, and operations of the blessed angels and of separate minds which some people will want to raise in opposition to me, are irrelevant. For we are arguing about natural things which are far inferior in dignity, about powers that exercise no choice of how to vary their action, and about minds which are not in the least separate, since they are yoked and bound to the celestial bodies which they are to bear. These, then, are the general objections that can be raised against  Ptolemy. \nBut something further may be said to Ptolemy, on account of which in particular he would wish to abandon his mean position of the sun and embrace the apparent with us. For if the power moving the planet (whether single or double) acts with respect to the sun, so that it places the planet at the lowest point of the epicycle whenever the center of the epicycle is opposite the sun, I ask (as above) why it looks to the imaginary point \u03a5 (which sometimes precedes and sometimes follows the sun, here marked \u03a3, and is sometimes above and sometimes below it), rather than the sun's body itself? Or how it is that that power can have any perception whatever of the motion of \u03a5 around the earth K, since there is no body at \u03a8? Is it not more probable that the epicycle is restored to the lines \u039a\u03a3 of the sun\u2019s apparent position, when these pass through the center of the epicycle?\n Let us then see what is changed on the eccentric by substitution of the sun\u2019s apparent position. Again (as before) when the sun \u0393, the center of the sun\u2019s eccentric \u03a8, and the earth \u039a are on the same line, so that the line of the sun\u2019s apparent position \u03a8\u0393 and the line of its mean position \u039a\u0393 coincide, then for the center of the epicycle \u03a4 this place remains the same, whether its sidereal position is designated by \u039a\u03a4 or by \u03a8\u03a4, and the planet is really on the line \u039a\u03a4 or \u03a8\u03a4 and at the lowest point on its epicycle \u03a6, since here it is nearest to both \u03a8 and \u039a. The planet is thereby truly divested of its second inequality. But when the sun comes to the side of its eccentric (that is, to the middle distances), a great enough difference arises. For let the sun have gone from \u0393 to \u03a3, and the line of the sun\u2019s mean position \u039a\u03a5 be found in Aries, and the planet\u2019s line of vision \u039a\u03a9 precisely opposite in Libra, so that \u03a5\u039a\u03a9 is a single line. Now since  Ptolemy declared that the planet \u03a9 on this line of vision \u039a\u03a9 is divested of its second inequality, he places the center of the epicycle \u0396 on the line \u039a\u03a9. But since \u039a\u03a3 has gone beyond \u039a\u03a5, the sun\u2019s apparent position is beyond opposition to the planet. And in the last part of the time, \u039a\u03a9 is not descending, so as to be opposite \u039a\u03a3, but ascends towards \u039a\u03a6, because the lowest parts of the epicycle \u03a9 are retrograde and swifter than the center \u0396, and it is there, of course, that the planet is at opposition to the sun. Therefore, this apparent opposition precedes the mean one.\nTherefore, at some time preceding the moment designated by \u039a\u03a5 (let it be \u039a\u0398) when the sun is seen on the line \u039a\u039e, the planet will be seen opposite it (suppose it to be at \u0399) on \u039a\u0399 which forms a straight line with \u039a\u039e. Also, because it is now laid down that it sheds the second inequality at this true opposition, the center of the epicycle will also be seen on this line \u039e\u039a, say at \u039f. And because the planet is retrograde, at the time \u039a\u0398 prior to \u039a\u03a5 the planet is on the line \u039a\u0399 later than at \u039a\u03a9. But \u039a\u0399 and \u039a\u03a9 are parts of the lines \u039a\u039f and \u039a\u0396. Therefore, \u039a\u039f too is more to the east than \u039a\u0396.\nThus it is clear what would be changed on the line of the epicycle\u2019s center by this restoration from the sun\u2019s mean position to its apparent position. For at \u03a4 and the opposite point on the original line the motions of the epicycle\u2019s center remain unchanged. At \u0396 this line, and the center of the epicycle upon it, is moved forward and a subtraction is made from the intervening time. At the opposite place the contrary happens: an addition is made to the time, and the line of motion of the center of the epicycle is moved back westward. And thus these lines of the center of the epicycle differ much from the original lines. For this reason also, when we investigate the causes and measure of the first inequality by a new and repeated operation using these several observed positions of the center of the epicycle (that is, using the observed positions of the planet, after which we suppose the center of the epicycle to lie upon the same line), the outcome of this operation differs much from that of the preceding one. That is, since the time in the semicircle containing the apogee will have been diminished, so that the planet is correspondingly faster, the eccentricity of the equant will come out smaller. And since in the greater quadrant \u0392\u0396 of the semicircle containing the apogee the time will have been diminished by an amount equal to the diminution in the other, smaller part, the planet has been made proportionally much faster in the remaining part of the semicircle. Therefore, the perigee has come closer to the latter, and the apogee has descended from \u03a7 towards \u0396.\nThe quantification of the new hypothesis will be made clear thus. It is presupposed that the planet \u03a9 falls on the line drawn from the center of the epicycle \u0396 through the earth \u039a, only when \u039a\u0396 is collinear with \u039a\u03a3, the sun\u2019s apparent position. Therefore, \u039a\u03a3 and the line drawn from \u0396 through the body of the planet always proceed in parallel. Moreover, we have just taken it from Ptolemy that at the time when the line of the sun\u2019s mean position was \u039a\u03a5, drawn through \u03a9, the planet was observed on the line \u039a\u03a9, and nonetheless we do not grant him that the center of the epicycle \u0396 is on \u039a\u03a9 at the same time. Therefore, in accord with our position, let a line be drawn from the planet\u2019s position \u03a9 parallel to \u039a\u03a3, and let this be \u03a9\u039f. We are supposing that the center of the epicycle is at this moment on the line \u03a9\u039f, or some other line nearby and parallel, according as \u03a9 (representing the planet) is closer to or farther from \u039a on the line \u039a\u0396. Let \u03a9\u039f be drawn from whatever point on the line \u039a\u0396 (now, it is \u03a9), equal to \u03a9\u0396. From \u039f let a line be drawn to \u0396\u039a parallel to \u039a\u03a8, and let this be \u039f\u0396. Now since \u0396\u03a9\u039f is equal to \u039a\u03a3\u03a8, and \u039a\u03a3 is imperceptibly greater than \u03a8\u03a3  or \u03a9\u039f (because \u039a\u03a8\u03a3 is right, and the angle at \u03a3 is not greater than 2\u00b0 3\u2019, so that if \u03a8\u03a3 is 100,000, \u039a\u03a3 is 100,064), \u039f\u0396 is also imperceptibly less than \u039a\u03a8. Let \u0396\u0394 be joined, and let a line be drawn at \u039f parallel to \u0396\u0394. Now the moment of time at which the center of the epicycle is placed at \u0396 by Ptolemy and at \u039f by me, is the same, and is designated by both of us by the line \u039a\u03a5 in the theory of the sun. In the theory of Mars, that moment should be designated in the former theory by \u0396\u0394, because \u0394 is the point of equality, while in the new theory it will be designated by a line parallel to \u0396\u0394. Therefore, there will be a new point of equality, about which the time is counted, on this parallel through \u039f. ","700":"Now Ptolemy measured out the courses of the planets, not on the lines \u039a\u03a3, but on the lines \u039a\u03a5 drawn from \u039a parallel to the lines \u03a8\u03a3 passing through the sun\u2019s body.

The planet is thereby truly divested of its second inequality. But when the sun comes to the side of its eccentric (that is, to the middle distances), a great enough difference arises. For let the sun have gone from \u0393 to \u03a3, and the line of the sun\u2019s mean position \u039a\u03a5 be found in Aries, and the planet\u2019s line of vision \u039a\u03a9 precisely opposite in Libra, so that \u03a5\u039a\u03a9 is a single line. Now since  Ptolemy declared that the planet \u03a9 on this line of vision \u039a\u03a9 is divested of its second inequality, he places the center of the epicycle \u0396 on the line \u039a\u03a9. But since \u039a\u03a3 has gone beyond \u039a\u03a5, the sun\u2019s apparent position is beyond opposition to the planet. And in the last part of the time, \u039a\u03a9 is not descending, so as to be opposite \u039a\u03a3, but ascends towards \u039a\u03a6, because the lowest parts of the epicycle \u03a9 are retrograde and swifter than the center \u0396, and it is there, of course, that the planet is at opposition to the sun. Therefore, this apparent opposition precedes the mean one.\nTherefore, at some time preceding the moment designated by \u039a\u03a5 (let it be \u039a\u0398) when the sun is seen on the line \u039a\u039e, the planet will be seen opposite it (suppose it to be at \u0399) on \u039a\u0399 which forms a straight line with \u039a\u039e. Also, because it is now laid down that it sheds the second inequality at this true opposition, the center of the epicycle will also be seen on this line \u039e\u039a, say at \u039f. And because the planet is retrograde, at the time \u039a\u0398 prior to \u039a\u03a5 the planet is on the line \u039a\u0399 later than at \u039a\u03a9. But \u039a\u0399 and \u039a\u03a9 are parts of the lines \u039a\u039f and \u039a\u0396. Therefore, \u039a\u039f too is more to the east than \u039a\u0396.\nThus it is clear what would be changed on the line of the epicycle\u2019s center by this restoration from the sun\u2019s mean position to its apparent position. For at \u03a4 and the opposite point on the original line the motions of the epicycle\u2019s center remain unchanged. At \u0396 this line, and the center of the epicycle upon it, is moved forward and a subtraction is made from the intervening time. At the opposite place the contrary happens: an addition is made to the time, and the line of motion of the center of the epicycle is moved back westward.

Therefore, the perigee has come closer to the latter, and the apogee has descended from \u03a7 towards \u0396.\nThe quantification of the new hypothesis will be made clear thus. It is presupposed that the planet \u03a9 falls on the line drawn from the center of the epicycle \u0396 through the earth \u039a, only when \u039a\u0396 is collinear with \u039a\u03a3, the sun\u2019s apparent position. Therefore, \u039a\u03a3 and the line drawn from \u0396 through the body of the planet always proceed in parallel. Moreover, we have just taken it from Ptolemy that at the time when the line of the sun\u2019s mean position was \u039a\u03a5, drawn through \u03a9, the planet was observed on the line \u039a\u03a9, and nonetheless we do not grant him that the center of the epicycle \u0396 is on \u039a\u03a9 at the same time. Therefore, in accord with our position, let a line be drawn from the planet\u2019s position \u03a9 parallel to \u039a\u03a3, and let this be \u03a9\u039f. We are supposing that the center of the epicycle is at this moment on the line \u03a9\u039f, or some other line nearby and parallel, according as \u03a9 (representing the planet) is closer to or farther from \u039a on the line \u039a\u0396. Let \u03a9\u039f be drawn from whatever point on the line \u039a\u0396 (now, it is \u03a9), equal to \u03a9\u0396. From \u039f let a line be drawn to \u0396\u039a parallel to \u039a\u03a8, and let this be \u039f\u0396. Now since \u0396\u03a9\u039f is equal to \u039a\u03a3\u03a8, and \u039a\u03a3 is imperceptibly greater than \u03a8\u03a3  or \u03a9\u039f (because \u039a\u03a8\u03a3 is right, and the angle at \u03a3 is not greater than 2\u00b0 3\u2019, so that if \u03a8\u03a3 is 100,000, \u039a\u03a3 is 100,064), \u039f\u0396 is also imperceptibly less than \u039a\u03a8. Let \u0396\u0394 be joined, and let a line be drawn at \u039f parallel to \u0396\u0394. Now the moment of time at which the center of the epicycle is placed at \u0396 by Ptolemy and at \u039f by me, is the same, and is designated by both of us by the line \u039a\u03a5 in the theory of the sun. In the theory of Mars, that moment should be designated in the former theory by \u0396\u0394, because \u0394 is the point of equality, while in the new theory it will be designated by a line parallel to \u0396\u0394. Therefore, there will be a new point of equality, about which the time is counted, on this parallel through \u039f. ","701":"Now Ptolemy measured out the courses of the planets, not on the lines \u039a\u03a3, but on the lines \u039a\u03a5 drawn from \u039a parallel to the lines \u03a8\u03a3 passing through the sun\u2019s body. For whenever the planet fell upon these lines \u039a\u03a5 on the side opposite the sun, it was supposed to have shed its second inequality, which fell to it (in Ptolemy\u2019s opinion) because of the epicycle. Then the planet\u2019s sidereal position was sought out by means of instruments, and the center of the epicycle was supposed to be found at that time on the same line. This was done a number of times and at various places on the zodiac: say, \u039a\u0393, \u039a\u03a5, and the points opposite. From three such positions of the planet (or of the center of the epicycle, which, according to Ptolemy, accounts for the second inequality), the practitioner sets out to investigate the hypothesis for the first inequality by comparing these angles which the observed positions form about \u039a, the center of the earth and of observation, with the intervening times. The method for this enterprise is found in Ptolemy Book IX ^19. Now suppose the treatment done, and let the eccentric's line of apsides come out to be \u039a\u039b\u0394\u03a7, with \u0394 the equalizing point, the center of the eccentric upon this line and at point \u039b, and the eccentric \u03a7\u0396. And let this hypothesis correspond to all positions observed at the times of the planet\u2019s opposition to the sun\u2019s mean position.\nHere, the objections I raised against Copernicus concerning the ordering of the physical motion are also not clearly in agreement with Ptolemy. For the center of the epicycle which accounts for the second inequality, here just as the planet itself previously, is borne slowly or swiftly according to its approach  to or recession from the earth \u039a, performed on the circle \u03a7\u0396. Furthermore, to stipulate that there is in the earth \u039a (just as there was before in Copernicus\u2019s sun, the heart of the world) a motive force that drives the centers of this kind of epicycle around, is absurd and monstrous. The hypothesis can also be discredited by another physical argument. For intrinsic to this form of hypothesis, in one way or another, is solidity of the orbs; and since this has been destroyed (by Tycho Brahe\u2019s observations of comets), the hypothesis appears, so to speak, to collapse under its own weight. For a moving force would be declared to reside in the center of the epicycle (not in a body, but in a mathematical point), and to rouse itself to move from place to place, by an unequal amount in equal times; but at the same time would draw the planet along with itself at the distance of the epicycle\u2019s diameter; all the while causing the planet to gyrate around itself, by equal amounts in equal times. That this enormous variety cannot fall to a single moving mind (unless it be God), Aristotle gives supporting arguments in the Metaphysics Book XII Ch. 8: he holds that the individual minds preside over individual, perfectly uniform and simple circular motions. Besides, how will some power sit in a non-body, and flow out of the non-body into the planet? Even if you divide up the tasks, and locate one motive intelligence at the center of the epicycle and another in the body of the planet, the one at the center will use the earth (a body, of course) as its reference, and will move around the earth nonuniformly in a circle, while the one at a point on the circumference (that is, in the planet's body) will move around an incorporeal center and do so uniformly. The question, then, is (as before), by what aids would it move around the incorporeal point? Not by geometrical imagination, for it does not admit of geometrical imagination of itself. Nor can a mobile point subsist in a non-body even in imagination. We humans, in imagining points of this sort, have recourse to the aids of tablets or paper, which we draw upon with our hands or at least remember ourselves to have drawn once. But it likewise cannot happen through a physical flowing of power (which is in the center of the epicycle) out to the circumference and the planet\u2019s body. For we have submitted to this outflow of power on the supposition that the tasks of the compound motions are divided between two minds. Why not also question whether in the first, eccentric motion, some natural force constituted to produce motion might subsist in some point entirely devoid of any body? And even more, whether this kind of incorporeal power can move itself around the earth, and go from place to place? And most of all, whether it can communicate or transfer another's motion through an efflux from itself, although it is not supported by any body that could serve as its nest? Those sublime considerations of the essence, motion, place, and operations of the blessed angels and of separate minds which some people will want to raise in opposition to me, are irrelevant. For we are arguing about natural things which are far inferior in dignity, about powers that exercise no choice of how to vary their action, and about minds which are not in the least separate, since they are yoked and bound to the celestial bodies which they are to bear. These, then, are the general objections that can be raised against  Ptolemy. \nBut something further may be said to Ptolemy, on account of which in particular he would wish to abandon his mean position of the sun and embrace the apparent with us. For if the power moving the planet (whether single or double) acts with respect to the sun, so that it places the planet at the lowest point of the epicycle whenever the center of the epicycle is opposite the sun, I ask (as above) why it looks to the imaginary point \u03a5 (which sometimes precedes and sometimes follows the sun, here marked \u03a3, and is sometimes above and sometimes below it), rather than the sun's body itself? Or how it is that that power can have any perception whatever of the motion of \u03a5 around the earth K, since there is no body at \u03a8? Is it not more probable that the epicycle is restored to the lines \u039a\u03a3 of the sun\u2019s apparent position, when these pass through the center of the epicycle?\n Let us then see what is changed on the eccentric by substitution of the sun\u2019s apparent position. Again (as before) when the sun \u0393, the center of the sun\u2019s eccentric \u03a8, and the earth \u039a are on the same line, so that the line of the sun\u2019s apparent position \u03a8\u0393 and the line of its mean position \u039a\u0393 coincide, then for the center of the epicycle \u03a4 this place remains the same, whether its sidereal position is designated by \u039a\u03a4 or by \u03a8\u03a4, and the planet is really on the line \u039a\u03a4 or \u03a8\u03a4 and at the lowest point on its epicycle \u03a6, since here it is nearest to both \u03a8 and \u039a. The planet is thereby truly divested of its second inequality. But when the sun comes to the side of its eccentric (that is, to the middle distances), a great enough difference arises. For let the sun have gone from \u0393 to \u03a3, and the line of the sun\u2019s mean position \u039a\u03a5 be found in Aries, and the planet\u2019s line of vision \u039a\u03a9 precisely opposite in Libra, so that \u03a5\u039a\u03a9 is a single line. Now since  Ptolemy declared that the planet \u03a9 on this line of vision \u039a\u03a9 is divested of its second inequality, he places the center of the epicycle \u0396 on the line \u039a\u03a9. But since \u039a\u03a3 has gone beyond \u039a\u03a5, the sun\u2019s apparent position is beyond opposition to the planet. And in the last part of the time, \u039a\u03a9 is not descending, so as to be opposite \u039a\u03a3, but ascends towards \u039a\u03a6, because the lowest parts of the epicycle \u03a9 are retrograde and swifter than the center \u0396, and it is there, of course, that the planet is at opposition to the sun. Therefore, this apparent opposition precedes the mean one.\nTherefore, at some time preceding the moment designated by \u039a\u03a5 (let it be \u039a\u0398) when the sun is seen on the line \u039a\u039e, the planet will be seen opposite it (suppose it to be at \u0399) on \u039a\u0399 which forms a straight line with \u039a\u039e. Also, because it is now laid down that it sheds the second inequality at this true opposition, the center of the epicycle will also be seen on this line \u039e\u039a, say at \u039f. And because the planet is retrograde, at the time \u039a\u0398 prior to \u039a\u03a5 the planet is on the line \u039a\u0399 later than at \u039a\u03a9. But \u039a\u0399 and \u039a\u03a9 are parts of the lines \u039a\u039f and \u039a\u0396. Therefore, \u039a\u039f too is more to the east than \u039a\u0396.\nThus it is clear what would be changed on the line of the epicycle\u2019s center by this restoration from the sun\u2019s mean position to its apparent position. For at \u03a4 and the opposite point on the original line the motions of the epicycle\u2019s center remain unchanged. At \u0396 this line, and the center of the epicycle upon it, is moved forward and a subtraction is made from the intervening time. At the opposite place the contrary happens: an addition is made to the time, and the line of motion of the center of the epicycle is moved back westward. And thus these lines of the center of the epicycle differ much from the original lines. For this reason also, when we investigate the causes and measure of the first inequality by a new and repeated operation using these several observed positions of the center of the epicycle (that is, using the observed positions of the planet, after which we suppose the center of the epicycle to lie upon the same line), the outcome of this operation differs much from that of the preceding one. That is, since the time in the semicircle containing the apogee will have been diminished, so that the planet is correspondingly faster, the eccentricity of the equant will come out smaller. And since in the greater quadrant \u0392\u0396 of the semicircle containing the apogee the time will have been diminished by an amount equal to the diminution in the other, smaller part, the planet has been made proportionally much faster in the remaining part of the semicircle. Therefore, the perigee has come closer to the latter, and the apogee has descended from \u03a7 towards \u0396.\nThe quantification of the new hypothesis will be made clear thus. It is presupposed that the planet \u03a9 falls on the line drawn from the center of the epicycle \u0396 through the earth \u039a, only when \u039a\u0396 is collinear with \u039a\u03a3, the sun\u2019s apparent position. Therefore, \u039a\u03a3 and the line drawn from \u0396 through the body of the planet always proceed in parallel. Moreover, we have just taken it from Ptolemy that at the time when the line of the sun\u2019s mean position was \u039a\u03a5, drawn through \u03a9, the planet was observed on the line \u039a\u03a9, and nonetheless we do not grant him that the center of the epicycle \u0396 is on \u039a\u03a9 at the same time. Therefore, in accord with our position, let a line be drawn from the planet\u2019s position \u03a9 parallel to \u039a\u03a3, and let this be \u03a9\u039f. We are supposing that the center of the epicycle is at this moment on the line \u03a9\u039f, or some other line nearby and parallel, according as \u03a9 (representing the planet) is closer to or farther from \u039a on the line \u039a\u0396. Let \u03a9\u039f be drawn from whatever point on the line \u039a\u0396 (now, it is \u03a9), equal to \u03a9\u0396. From \u039f let a line be drawn to \u0396\u039a parallel to \u039a\u03a8, and let this be \u039f\u0396. Now since \u0396\u03a9\u039f is equal to \u039a\u03a3\u03a8, and \u039a\u03a3 is imperceptibly greater than \u03a8\u03a3  or \u03a9\u039f (because \u039a\u03a8\u03a3 is right, and the angle at \u03a3 is not greater than 2\u00b0 3\u2019, so that if \u03a8\u03a3 is 100,000, \u039a\u03a3 is 100,064), \u039f\u0396 is also imperceptibly less than \u039a\u03a8. Let \u0396\u0394 be joined, and let a line be drawn at \u039f parallel to \u0396\u0394. Now the moment of time at which the center of the epicycle is placed at \u0396 by Ptolemy and at \u039f by me, is the same, and is designated by both of us by the line \u039a\u03a5 in the theory of the sun. In the theory of Mars, that moment should be designated in the former theory by \u0396\u0394, because \u0394 is the point of equality, while in the new theory it will be designated by a line parallel to \u0396\u0394. Therefore, there will be a new point of equality, about which the time is counted, on this parallel through \u039f. ","702":"Now Ptolemy measured out the courses of the planets, not on the lines \u039a\u03a3, but on the lines \u039a\u03a5 drawn from \u039a parallel to the lines \u03a8\u03a3 passing through the sun\u2019s body.

The planet is thereby truly divested of its second inequality. But when the sun comes to the side of its eccentric (that is, to the middle distances), a great enough difference arises. For let the sun have gone from \u0393 to \u03a3, and the line of the sun\u2019s mean position \u039a\u03a5 be found in Aries, and the planet\u2019s line of vision \u039a\u03a9 precisely opposite in Libra, so that \u03a5\u039a\u03a9 is a single line. Now since  Ptolemy declared that the planet \u03a9 on this line of vision \u039a\u03a9 is divested of its second inequality, he places the center of the epicycle \u0396 on the line \u039a\u03a9. But since \u039a\u03a3 has gone beyond \u039a\u03a5, the sun\u2019s apparent position is beyond opposition to the planet. And in the last part of the time, \u039a\u03a9 is not descending, so as to be opposite \u039a\u03a3, but ascends towards \u039a\u03a6, because the lowest parts of the epicycle \u03a9 are retrograde and swifter than the center \u0396, and it is there, of course, that the planet is at opposition to the sun. Therefore, this apparent opposition precedes the mean one.\nTherefore, at some time preceding the moment designated by \u039a\u03a5 (let it be \u039a\u0398) when the sun is seen on the line \u039a\u039e, the planet will be seen opposite it (suppose it to be at \u0399) on \u039a\u0399 which forms a straight line with \u039a\u039e. Also, because it is now laid down that it sheds the second inequality at this true opposition, the center of the epicycle will also be seen on this line \u039e\u039a, say at \u039f. And because the planet is retrograde, at the time \u039a\u0398 prior to \u039a\u03a5 the planet is on the line \u039a\u0399 later than at \u039a\u03a9. But \u039a\u0399 and \u039a\u03a9 are parts of the lines \u039a\u039f and \u039a\u0396. Therefore, \u039a\u039f too is more to the east than \u039a\u0396.\nThus it is clear what would be changed on the line of the epicycle\u2019s center by this restoration from the sun\u2019s mean position to its apparent position. For at \u03a4 and the opposite point on the original line the motions of the epicycle\u2019s center remain unchanged. At \u0396 this line, and the center of the epicycle upon it, is moved forward and a subtraction is made from the intervening time. At the opposite place the contrary happens: an addition is made to the time, and the line of motion of the center of the epicycle is moved back westward.

Therefore, the perigee has come closer to the latter, and the apogee has descended from \u03a7 towards \u0396.\nThe quantification of the new hypothesis will be made clear thus. It is presupposed that the planet \u03a9 falls on the line drawn from the center of the epicycle \u0396 through the earth \u039a, only when \u039a\u0396 is collinear with \u039a\u03a3, the sun\u2019s apparent position. Therefore, \u039a\u03a3 and the line drawn from \u0396 through the body of the planet always proceed in parallel. Moreover, we have just taken it from Ptolemy that at the time when the line of the sun\u2019s mean position was \u039a\u03a5, drawn through \u03a9, the planet was observed on the line \u039a\u03a9, and nonetheless we do not grant him that the center of the epicycle \u0396 is on \u039a\u03a9 at the same time. Therefore, in accord with our position, let a line be drawn from the planet\u2019s position \u03a9 parallel to \u039a\u03a3, and let this be \u03a9\u039f. We are supposing that the center of the epicycle is at this moment on the line \u03a9\u039f, or some other line nearby and parallel, according as \u03a9 (representing the planet) is closer to or farther from \u039a on the line \u039a\u0396. Let \u03a9\u039f be drawn from whatever point on the line \u039a\u0396 (now, it is \u03a9), equal to \u03a9\u0396. From \u039f let a line be drawn to \u0396\u039a parallel to \u039a\u03a8, and let this be \u039f\u0396. Now since \u0396\u03a9\u039f is equal to \u039a\u03a3\u03a8, and \u039a\u03a3 is imperceptibly greater than \u03a8\u03a3  or \u03a9\u039f (because \u039a\u03a8\u03a3 is right, and the angle at \u03a3 is not greater than 2\u00b0 3\u2019, so that if \u03a8\u03a3 is 100,000, \u039a\u03a3 is 100,064), \u039f\u0396 is also imperceptibly less than \u039a\u03a8. Let \u0396\u0394 be joined, and let a line be drawn at \u039f parallel to \u0396\u0394. Now the moment of time at which the center of the epicycle is placed at \u0396 by Ptolemy and at \u039f by me, is the same, and is designated by both of us by the line \u039a\u03a5 in the theory of the sun. In the theory of Mars, that moment should be designated in the former theory by \u0396\u0394, because \u0394 is the point of equality, while in the new theory it will be designated by a line parallel to \u0396\u0394. Therefore, there will be a new point of equality, about which the time is counted, on this parallel through \u039f. ","703":"Now Ptolemy measured out the courses of the planets, not on the lines \u039a\u03a3, but on the lines \u039a\u03a5 drawn from \u039a parallel to the lines \u03a8\u03a3 passing through the sun\u2019s body. For whenever the planet fell upon these lines \u039a\u03a5 on the side opposite the sun, it was supposed to have shed its second inequality, which fell to it (in Ptolemy\u2019s opinion) because of the epicycle. Then the planet\u2019s sidereal position was sought out by means of instruments, and the center of the epicycle was supposed to be found at that time on the same line. This was done a number of times and at various places on the zodiac: say, \u039a\u0393, \u039a\u03a5, and the points opposite. From three such positions of the planet (or of the center of the epicycle, which, according to Ptolemy, accounts for the second inequality), the practitioner sets out to investigate the hypothesis for the first inequality by comparing these angles which the observed positions form about \u039a, the center of the earth and of observation, with the intervening times. The method for this enterprise is found in Ptolemy Book IX ^19. Now suppose the treatment done, and let the eccentric's line of apsides come out to be \u039a\u039b\u0394\u03a7, with \u0394 the equalizing point, the center of the eccentric upon this line and at point \u039b, and the eccentric \u03a7\u0396. And let this hypothesis correspond to all positions observed at the times of the planet\u2019s opposition to the sun\u2019s mean position.\nHere, the objections I raised against Copernicus concerning the ordering of the physical motion are also not clearly in agreement with Ptolemy. For the center of the epicycle which accounts for the second inequality, here just as the planet itself previously, is borne slowly or swiftly according to its approach  to or recession from the earth \u039a, performed on the circle \u03a7\u0396. Furthermore, to stipulate that there is in the earth \u039a (just as there was before in Copernicus\u2019s sun, the heart of the world) a motive force that drives the centers of this kind of epicycle around, is absurd and monstrous. The hypothesis can also be discredited by another physical argument. For intrinsic to this form of hypothesis, in one way or another, is solidity of the orbs; and since this has been destroyed (by Tycho Brahe\u2019s observations of comets), the hypothesis appears, so to speak, to collapse under its own weight. For a moving force would be declared to reside in the center of the epicycle (not in a body, but in a mathematical point), and to rouse itself to move from place to place, by an unequal amount in equal times; but at the same time would draw the planet along with itself at the distance of the epicycle\u2019s diameter; all the while causing the planet to gyrate around itself, by equal amounts in equal times. That this enormous variety cannot fall to a single moving mind (unless it be God), Aristotle gives supporting arguments in the Metaphysics Book XII Ch. 8: he holds that the individual minds preside over individual, perfectly uniform and simple circular motions. Besides, how will some power sit in a non-body, and flow out of the non-body into the planet? Even if you divide up the tasks, and locate one motive intelligence at the center of the epicycle and another in the body of the planet, the one at the center will use the earth (a body, of course) as its reference, and will move around the earth nonuniformly in a circle, while the one at a point on the circumference (that is, in the planet's body) will move around an incorporeal center and do so uniformly. The question, then, is (as before), by what aids would it move around the incorporeal point? Not by geometrical imagination, for it does not admit of geometrical imagination of itself. Nor can a mobile point subsist in a non-body even in imagination. We humans, in imagining points of this sort, have recourse to the aids of tablets or paper, which we draw upon with our hands or at least remember ourselves to have drawn once. But it likewise cannot happen through a physical flowing of power (which is in the center of the epicycle) out to the circumference and the planet\u2019s body. For we have submitted to this outflow of power on the supposition that the tasks of the compound motions are divided between two minds. Why not also question whether in the first, eccentric motion, some natural force constituted to produce motion might subsist in some point entirely devoid of any body? And even more, whether this kind of incorporeal power can move itself around the earth, and go from place to place? And most of all, whether it can communicate or transfer another's motion through an efflux from itself, although it is not supported by any body that could serve as its nest? Those sublime considerations of the essence, motion, place, and operations of the blessed angels and of separate minds which some people will want to raise in opposition to me, are irrelevant. For we are arguing about natural things which are far inferior in dignity, about powers that exercise no choice of how to vary their action, and about minds which are not in the least separate, since they are yoked and bound to the celestial bodies which they are to bear. These, then, are the general objections that can be raised against  Ptolemy. \nBut something further may be said to Ptolemy, on account of which in particular he would wish to abandon his mean position of the sun and embrace the apparent with us. For if the power moving the planet (whether single or double) acts with respect to the sun, so that it places the planet at the lowest point of the epicycle whenever the center of the epicycle is opposite the sun, I ask (as above) why it looks to the imaginary point \u03a5 (which sometimes precedes and sometimes follows the sun, here marked \u03a3, and is sometimes above and sometimes below it), rather than the sun's body itself? Or how it is that that power can have any perception whatever of the motion of \u03a5 around the earth K, since there is no body at \u03a8? Is it not more probable that the epicycle is restored to the lines \u039a\u03a3 of the sun\u2019s apparent position, when these pass through the center of the epicycle?\n Let us then see what is changed on the eccentric by substitution of the sun\u2019s apparent position. Again (as before) when the sun \u0393, the center of the sun\u2019s eccentric \u03a8, and the earth \u039a are on the same line, so that the line of the sun\u2019s apparent position \u03a8\u0393 and the line of its mean position \u039a\u0393 coincide, then for the center of the epicycle \u03a4 this place remains the same, whether its sidereal position is designated by \u039a\u03a4 or by \u03a8\u03a4, and the planet is really on the line \u039a\u03a4 or \u03a8\u03a4 and at the lowest point on its epicycle \u03a6, since here it is nearest to both \u03a8 and \u039a. The planet is thereby truly divested of its second inequality. But when the sun comes to the side of its eccentric (that is, to the middle distances), a great enough difference arises. For let the sun have gone from \u0393 to \u03a3, and the line of the sun\u2019s mean position \u039a\u03a5 be found in Aries, and the planet\u2019s line of vision \u039a\u03a9 precisely opposite in Libra, so that \u03a5\u039a\u03a9 is a single line. Now since  Ptolemy declared that the planet \u03a9 on this line of vision \u039a\u03a9 is divested of its second inequality, he places the center of the epicycle \u0396 on the line \u039a\u03a9. But since \u039a\u03a3 has gone beyond \u039a\u03a5, the sun\u2019s apparent position is beyond opposition to the planet. And in the last part of the time, \u039a\u03a9 is not descending, so as to be opposite \u039a\u03a3, but ascends towards \u039a\u03a6, because the lowest parts of the epicycle \u03a9 are retrograde and swifter than the center \u0396, and it is there, of course, that the planet is at opposition to the sun. Therefore, this apparent opposition precedes the mean one.\nTherefore, at some time preceding the moment designated by \u039a\u03a5 (let it be \u039a\u0398) when the sun is seen on the line \u039a\u039e, the planet will be seen opposite it (suppose it to be at \u0399) on \u039a\u0399 which forms a straight line with \u039a\u039e. Also, because it is now laid down that it sheds the second inequality at this true opposition, the center of the epicycle will also be seen on this line \u039e\u039a, say at \u039f. And because the planet is retrograde, at the time \u039a\u0398 prior to \u039a\u03a5 the planet is on the line \u039a\u0399 later than at \u039a\u03a9. But \u039a\u0399 and \u039a\u03a9 are parts of the lines \u039a\u039f and \u039a\u0396. Therefore, \u039a\u039f too is more to the east than \u039a\u0396.\nThus it is clear what would be changed on the line of the epicycle\u2019s center by this restoration from the sun\u2019s mean position to its apparent position. For at \u03a4 and the opposite point on the original line the motions of the epicycle\u2019s center remain unchanged. At \u0396 this line, and the center of the epicycle upon it, is moved forward and a subtraction is made from the intervening time. At the opposite place the contrary happens: an addition is made to the time, and the line of motion of the center of the epicycle is moved back westward. And thus these lines of the center of the epicycle differ much from the original lines. For this reason also, when we investigate the causes and measure of the first inequality by a new and repeated operation using these several observed positions of the center of the epicycle (that is, using the observed positions of the planet, after which we suppose the center of the epicycle to lie upon the same line), the outcome of this operation differs much from that of the preceding one. That is, since the time in the semicircle containing the apogee will have been diminished, so that the planet is correspondingly faster, the eccentricity of the equant will come out smaller. And since in the greater quadrant \u0392\u0396 of the semicircle containing the apogee the time will have been diminished by an amount equal to the diminution in the other, smaller part, the planet has been made proportionally much faster in the remaining part of the semicircle. Therefore, the perigee has come closer to the latter, and the apogee has descended from \u03a7 towards \u0396.\nThe quantification of the new hypothesis will be made clear thus. It is presupposed that the planet \u03a9 falls on the line drawn from the center of the epicycle \u0396 through the earth \u039a, only when \u039a\u0396 is collinear with \u039a\u03a3, the sun\u2019s apparent position. Therefore, \u039a\u03a3 and the line drawn from \u0396 through the body of the planet always proceed in parallel. Moreover, we have just taken it from Ptolemy that at the time when the line of the sun\u2019s mean position was \u039a\u03a5, drawn through \u03a9, the planet was observed on the line \u039a\u03a9, and nonetheless we do not grant him that the center of the epicycle \u0396 is on \u039a\u03a9 at the same time. Therefore, in accord with our position, let a line be drawn from the planet\u2019s position \u03a9 parallel to \u039a\u03a3, and let this be \u03a9\u039f. We are supposing that the center of the epicycle is at this moment on the line \u03a9\u039f, or some other line nearby and parallel, according as \u03a9 (representing the planet) is closer to or farther from \u039a on the line \u039a\u0396. Let \u03a9\u039f be drawn from whatever point on the line \u039a\u0396 (now, it is \u03a9), equal to \u03a9\u0396. From \u039f let a line be drawn to \u0396\u039a parallel to \u039a\u03a8, and let this be \u039f\u0396. Now since \u0396\u03a9\u039f is equal to \u039a\u03a3\u03a8, and \u039a\u03a3 is imperceptibly greater than \u03a8\u03a3  or \u03a9\u039f (because \u039a\u03a8\u03a3 is right, and the angle at \u03a3 is not greater than 2\u00b0 3\u2019, so that if \u03a8\u03a3 is 100,000, \u039a\u03a3 is 100,064), \u039f\u0396 is also imperceptibly less than \u039a\u03a8. Let \u0396\u0394 be joined, and let a line be drawn at \u039f parallel to \u0396\u0394. Now the moment of time at which the center of the epicycle is placed at \u0396 by Ptolemy and at \u039f by me, is the same, and is designated by both of us by the line \u039a\u03a5 in the theory of the sun. In the theory of Mars, that moment should be designated in the former theory by \u0396\u0394, because \u0394 is the point of equality, while in the new theory it will be designated by a line parallel to \u0396\u0394. Therefore, there will be a new point of equality, about which the time is counted, on this parallel through \u039f. ","704":"Now Ptolemy measured out the courses of the planets, not on the lines \u039a\u03a3, but on the lines \u039a\u03a5 drawn from \u039a parallel to the lines \u03a8\u03a3 passing through the sun\u2019s body.

The planet is thereby truly divested of its second inequality. But when the sun comes to the side of its eccentric (that is, to the middle distances), a great enough difference arises. For let the sun have gone from \u0393 to \u03a3, and the line of the sun\u2019s mean position \u039a\u03a5 be found in Aries, and the planet\u2019s line of vision \u039a\u03a9 precisely opposite in Libra, so that \u03a5\u039a\u03a9 is a single line. Now since  Ptolemy declared that the planet \u03a9 on this line of vision \u039a\u03a9 is divested of its second inequality, he places the center of the epicycle \u0396 on the line \u039a\u03a9. But since \u039a\u03a3 has gone beyond \u039a\u03a5, the sun\u2019s apparent position is beyond opposition to the planet. And in the last part of the time, \u039a\u03a9 is not descending, so as to be opposite \u039a\u03a3, but ascends towards \u039a\u03a6, because the lowest parts of the epicycle \u03a9 are retrograde and swifter than the center \u0396, and it is there, of course, that the planet is at opposition to the sun. Therefore, this apparent opposition precedes the mean one.\nTherefore, at some time preceding the moment designated by \u039a\u03a5 (let it be \u039a\u0398) when the sun is seen on the line \u039a\u039e, the planet will be seen opposite it (suppose it to be at \u0399) on \u039a\u0399 which forms a straight line with \u039a\u039e. Also, because it is now laid down that it sheds the second inequality at this true opposition, the center of the epicycle will also be seen on this line \u039e\u039a, say at \u039f. And because the planet is retrograde, at the time \u039a\u0398 prior to \u039a\u03a5 the planet is on the line \u039a\u0399 later than at \u039a\u03a9. But \u039a\u0399 and \u039a\u03a9 are parts of the lines \u039a\u039f and \u039a\u0396. Therefore, \u039a\u039f too is more to the east than \u039a\u0396.\nThus it is clear what would be changed on the line of the epicycle\u2019s center by this restoration from the sun\u2019s mean position to its apparent position. For at \u03a4 and the opposite point on the original line the motions of the epicycle\u2019s center remain unchanged. At \u0396 this line, and the center of the epicycle upon it, is moved forward and a subtraction is made from the intervening time. At the opposite place the contrary happens: an addition is made to the time, and the line of motion of the center of the epicycle is moved back westward. And thus these lines of the center of the epicycle differ much from the original lines. For this reason also, when we investigate the causes and measure of the first inequality by a new and repeated operation using these several observed positions of the center of the epicycle (that is, using the observed positions of the planet, after which we suppose the center of the epicycle to lie upon the same line), the outcome of this operation differs much from that of the preceding one. That is, since the time in the semicircle containing the apogee will have been diminished, so that the planet is correspondingly faster, the eccentricity of the equant will come out smaller. And since in the greater quadrant \u0392\u0396 of the semicircle containing the apogee the time will have been diminished by an amount equal to the diminution in the other, smaller part, the planet has been made proportionally much faster in the remaining part of the semicircle. Therefore, the perigee has come closer to the latter, and the apogee has descended from \u03a7 towards \u0396.\nThe quantification of the new hypothesis will be made clear thus. It is presupposed that the planet \u03a9 falls on the line drawn from the center of the epicycle \u0396 through the earth \u039a, only when \u039a\u0396 is collinear with \u039a\u03a3, the sun\u2019s apparent position. Therefore, \u039a\u03a3 and the line drawn from \u0396 through the body of the planet always proceed in parallel. Moreover, we have just taken it from Ptolemy that at the time when the line of the sun\u2019s mean position was \u039a\u03a5, drawn through \u03a9, the planet was observed on the line \u039a\u03a9, and nonetheless we do not grant him that the center of the epicycle \u0396 is on \u039a\u03a9 at the same time. Therefore, in accord with our position, let a line be drawn from the planet\u2019s position \u03a9 parallel to \u039a\u03a3, and let this be \u03a9\u039f. We are supposing that the center of the epicycle is at this moment on the line \u03a9\u039f, or some other line nearby and parallel, according as \u03a9 (representing the planet) is closer to or farther from \u039a on the line \u039a\u0396. Let \u03a9\u039f be drawn from whatever point on the line \u039a\u0396 (now, it is \u03a9), equal to \u03a9\u0396. From \u039f let a line be drawn to \u0396\u039a parallel to \u039a\u03a8, and let this be \u039f\u0396. Now since \u0396\u03a9\u039f is equal to \u039a\u03a3\u03a8, and \u039a\u03a3 is imperceptibly greater than \u03a8\u03a3  or \u03a9\u039f (because \u039a\u03a8\u03a3 is right, and the angle at \u03a3 is not greater than 2\u00b0 3\u2019, so that if \u03a8\u03a3 is 100,000, \u039a\u03a3 is 100,064), \u039f\u0396 is also imperceptibly less than \u039a\u03a8. Let \u0396\u0394 be joined, and let a line be drawn at \u039f parallel to \u0396\u0394. Now the moment of time at which the center of the epicycle is placed at \u0396 by Ptolemy and at \u039f by me, is the same, and is designated by both of us by the line \u039a\u03a5 in the theory of the sun. In the theory of Mars, that moment should be designated in the former theory by \u0396\u0394, because \u0394 is the point of equality, while in the new theory it will be designated by a line parallel to \u0396\u0394. Therefore, there will be a new point of equality, about which the time is counted, on this parallel through \u039f. ","705":"Now Ptolemy measured out the courses of the planets, not on the lines \u039a\u03a3, but on the lines \u039a\u03a5 drawn from \u039a parallel to the lines \u03a8\u03a3 passing through the sun\u2019s body. For whenever the planet fell upon these lines \u039a\u03a5 on the side opposite the sun, it was supposed to have shed its second inequality, which fell to it (in Ptolemy\u2019s opinion) because of the epicycle. Then the planet\u2019s sidereal position was sought out by means of instruments, and the center of the epicycle was supposed to be found at that time on the same line. This was done a number of times and at various places on the zodiac: say, \u039a\u0393, \u039a\u03a5, and the points opposite. From three such positions of the planet (or of the center of the epicycle, which, according to Ptolemy, accounts for the second inequality), the practitioner sets out to investigate the hypothesis for the first inequality by comparing these angles which the observed positions form about \u039a, the center of the earth and of observation, with the intervening times. The method for this enterprise is found in Ptolemy Book IX ^19. Now suppose the treatment done, and let the eccentric's line of apsides come out to be \u039a\u039b\u0394\u03a7, with \u0394 the equalizing point, the center of the eccentric upon this line and at point \u039b, and the eccentric \u03a7\u0396. And let this hypothesis correspond to all positions observed at the times of the planet\u2019s opposition to the sun\u2019s mean position.\nHere, the objections I raised against Copernicus concerning the ordering of the physical motion are also not clearly in agreement with Ptolemy. For the center of the epicycle which accounts for the second inequality, here just as the planet itself previously, is borne slowly or swiftly according to its approach  to or recession from the earth \u039a, performed on the circle \u03a7\u0396. Furthermore, to stipulate that there is in the earth \u039a (just as there was before in Copernicus\u2019s sun, the heart of the world) a motive force that drives the centers of this kind of epicycle around, is absurd and monstrous. The hypothesis can also be discredited by another physical argument. For intrinsic to this form of hypothesis, in one way or another, is solidity of the orbs; and since this has been destroyed (by Tycho Brahe\u2019s observations of comets), the hypothesis appears, so to speak, to collapse under its own weight. For a moving force would be declared to reside in the center of the epicycle (not in a body, but in a mathematical point), and to rouse itself to move from place to place, by an unequal amount in equal times; but at the same time would draw the planet along with itself at the distance of the epicycle\u2019s diameter; all the while causing the planet to gyrate around itself, by equal amounts in equal times. That this enormous variety cannot fall to a single moving mind (unless it be God), Aristotle gives supporting arguments in the Metaphysics Book XII Ch. 8: he holds that the individual minds preside over individual, perfectly uniform and simple circular motions. Besides, how will some power sit in a non-body, and flow out of the non-body into the planet? Even if you divide up the tasks, and locate one motive intelligence at the center of the epicycle and another in the body of the planet, the one at the center will use the earth (a body, of course) as its reference, and will move around the earth nonuniformly in a circle, while the one at a point on the circumference (that is, in the planet's body) will move around an incorporeal center and do so uniformly. The question, then, is (as before), by what aids would it move around the incorporeal point? Not by geometrical imagination, for it does not admit of geometrical imagination of itself. Nor can a mobile point subsist in a non-body even in imagination. We humans, in imagining points of this sort, have recourse to the aids of tablets or paper, which we draw upon with our hands or at least remember ourselves to have drawn once. But it likewise cannot happen through a physical flowing of power (which is in the center of the epicycle) out to the circumference and the planet\u2019s body. For we have submitted to this outflow of power on the supposition that the tasks of the compound motions are divided between two minds. Why not also question whether in the first, eccentric motion, some natural force constituted to produce motion might subsist in some point entirely devoid of any body? And even more, whether this kind of incorporeal power can move itself around the earth, and go from place to place? And most of all, whether it can communicate or transfer another's motion through an efflux from itself, although it is not supported by any body that could serve as its nest? Those sublime considerations of the essence, motion, place, and operations of the blessed angels and of separate minds which some people will want to raise in opposition to me, are irrelevant. For we are arguing about natural things which are far inferior in dignity, about powers that exercise no choice of how to vary their action, and about minds which are not in the least separate, since they are yoked and bound to the celestial bodies which they are to bear. These, then, are the general objections that can be raised against  Ptolemy. \nBut something further may be said to Ptolemy, on account of which in particular he would wish to abandon his mean position of the sun and embrace the apparent with us. For if the power moving the planet (whether single or double) acts with respect to the sun, so that it places the planet at the lowest point of the epicycle whenever the center of the epicycle is opposite the sun, I ask (as above) why it looks to the imaginary point \u03a5 (which sometimes precedes and sometimes follows the sun, here marked \u03a3, and is sometimes above and sometimes below it), rather than the sun's body itself? Or how it is that that power can have any perception whatever of the motion of \u03a5 around the earth K, since there is no body at \u03a8? Is it not more probable that the epicycle is restored to the lines \u039a\u03a3 of the sun\u2019s apparent position, when these pass through the center of the epicycle?\n Let us then see what is changed on the eccentric by substitution of the sun\u2019s apparent position. Again (as before) when the sun \u0393, the center of the sun\u2019s eccentric \u03a8, and the earth \u039a are on the same line, so that the line of the sun\u2019s apparent position \u03a8\u0393 and the line of its mean position \u039a\u0393 coincide, then for the center of the epicycle \u03a4 this place remains the same, whether its sidereal position is designated by \u039a\u03a4 or by \u03a8\u03a4, and the planet is really on the line \u039a\u03a4 or \u03a8\u03a4 and at the lowest point on its epicycle \u03a6, since here it is nearest to both \u03a8 and \u039a. The planet is thereby truly divested of its second inequality. But when the sun comes to the side of its eccentric (that is, to the middle distances), a great enough difference arises. For let the sun have gone from \u0393 to \u03a3, and the line of the sun\u2019s mean position \u039a\u03a5 be found in Aries, and the planet\u2019s line of vision \u039a\u03a9 precisely opposite in Libra, so that \u03a5\u039a\u03a9 is a single line. Now since  Ptolemy declared that the planet \u03a9 on this line of vision \u039a\u03a9 is divested of its second inequality, he places the center of the epicycle \u0396 on the line \u039a\u03a9. But since \u039a\u03a3 has gone beyond \u039a\u03a5, the sun\u2019s apparent position is beyond opposition to the planet. And in the last part of the time, \u039a\u03a9 is not descending, so as to be opposite \u039a\u03a3, but ascends towards \u039a\u03a6, because the lowest parts of the epicycle \u03a9 are retrograde and swifter than the center \u0396, and it is there, of course, that the planet is at opposition to the sun. Therefore, this apparent opposition precedes the mean one.\nTherefore, at some time preceding the moment designated by \u039a\u03a5 (let it be \u039a\u0398) when the sun is seen on the line \u039a\u039e, the planet will be seen opposite it (suppose it to be at \u0399) on \u039a\u0399 which forms a straight line with \u039a\u039e. Also, because it is now laid down that it sheds the second inequality at this true opposition, the center of the epicycle will also be seen on this line \u039e\u039a, say at \u039f. And because the planet is retrograde, at the time \u039a\u0398 prior to \u039a\u03a5 the planet is on the line \u039a\u0399 later than at \u039a\u03a9. But \u039a\u0399 and \u039a\u03a9 are parts of the lines \u039a\u039f and \u039a\u0396. Therefore, \u039a\u039f too is more to the east than \u039a\u0396.\nThus it is clear what would be changed on the line of the epicycle\u2019s center by this restoration from the sun\u2019s mean position to its apparent position. For at \u03a4 and the opposite point on the original line the motions of the epicycle\u2019s center remain unchanged. At \u0396 this line, and the center of the epicycle upon it, is moved forward and a subtraction is made from the intervening time. At the opposite place the contrary happens: an addition is made to the time, and the line of motion of the center of the epicycle is moved back westward. And thus these lines of the center of the epicycle differ much from the original lines. For this reason also, when we investigate the causes and measure of the first inequality by a new and repeated operation using these several observed positions of the center of the epicycle (that is, using the observed positions of the planet, after which we suppose the center of the epicycle to lie upon the same line), the outcome of this operation differs much from that of the preceding one. That is, since the time in the semicircle containing the apogee will have been diminished, so that the planet is correspondingly faster, the eccentricity of the equant will come out smaller. And since in the greater quadrant \u0392\u0396 of the semicircle containing the apogee the time will have been diminished by an amount equal to the diminution in the other, smaller part, the planet has been made proportionally much faster in the remaining part of the semicircle. Therefore, the perigee has come closer to the latter, and the apogee has descended from \u03a7 towards \u0396.\nThe quantification of the new hypothesis will be made clear thus. It is presupposed that the planet \u03a9 falls on the line drawn from the center of the epicycle \u0396 through the earth \u039a, only when \u039a\u0396 is collinear with \u039a\u03a3, the sun\u2019s apparent position. Therefore, \u039a\u03a3 and the line drawn from \u0396 through the body of the planet always proceed in parallel. Moreover, we have just taken it from Ptolemy that at the time when the line of the sun\u2019s mean position was \u039a\u03a5, drawn through \u03a9, the planet was observed on the line \u039a\u03a9, and nonetheless we do not grant him that the center of the epicycle \u0396 is on \u039a\u03a9 at the same time. Therefore, in accord with our position, let a line be drawn from the planet\u2019s position \u03a9 parallel to \u039a\u03a3, and let this be \u03a9\u039f. We are supposing that the center of the epicycle is at this moment on the line \u03a9\u039f, or some other line nearby and parallel, according as \u03a9 (representing the planet) is closer to or farther from \u039a on the line \u039a\u0396. Let \u03a9\u039f be drawn from whatever point on the line \u039a\u0396 (now, it is \u03a9), equal to \u03a9\u0396. From \u039f let a line be drawn to \u0396\u039a parallel to \u039a\u03a8, and let this be \u039f\u0396. Now since \u0396\u03a9\u039f is equal to \u039a\u03a3\u03a8, and \u039a\u03a3 is imperceptibly greater than \u03a8\u03a3  or \u03a9\u039f (because \u039a\u03a8\u03a3 is right, and the angle at \u03a3 is not greater than 2\u00b0 3\u2019, so that if \u03a8\u03a3 is 100,000, \u039a\u03a3 is 100,064), \u039f\u0396 is also imperceptibly less than \u039a\u03a8. Let \u0396\u0394 be joined, and let a line be drawn at \u039f parallel to \u0396\u0394. Now the moment of time at which the center of the epicycle is placed at \u0396 by Ptolemy and at \u039f by me, is the same, and is designated by both of us by the line \u039a\u03a5 in the theory of the sun. In the theory of Mars, that moment should be designated in the former theory by \u0396\u0394, because \u0394 is the point of equality, while in the new theory it will be designated by a line parallel to \u0396\u0394. Therefore, there will be a new point of equality, about which the time is counted, on this parallel through \u039f.

But since \u039a\u03a3 has gone beyond \u039a\u03a5, the sun\u2019s apparent position is beyond opposition to the planet. And in the last part of the time, \u039a\u03a9 is not descending, so as to be opposite \u039a\u03a3, but ascends towards \u039a\u03a6, because the lowest parts of the epicycle \u03a9 are retrograde and swifter than the center \u0396, and it is there, of course, that the planet is at opposition to the sun. Therefore, this apparent opposition precedes the mean one.\nTherefore, at some time preceding the moment designated by \u039a\u03a5 (let it be \u039a\u0398) when the sun is seen on the line \u039a\u039e, the planet will be seen opposite it (suppose it to be at \u0399) on \u039a\u0399 which forms a straight line with \u039a\u039e. Also, because it is now laid down that it sheds the second inequality at this true opposition, the center of the epicycle will also be seen on this line \u039e\u039a, say at \u039f.

But \u039a\u0399 and \u039a\u03a9 are parts of the lines \u039a\u039f and \u039a\u0396. Therefore, \u039a\u039f too is more to the east than \u039a\u0396.\nThus it is clear what would be changed on the line of the epicycle\u2019s center by this restoration from the sun\u2019s mean position to its apparent position. For at \u03a4 and the opposite point on the original line the motions of the epicycle\u2019s center remain unchanged.

It is presupposed that the planet \u03a9 falls on the line drawn from the center of the epicycle \u0396 through the earth \u039a, only when \u039a\u0396 is collinear with \u039a\u03a3, the sun\u2019s apparent position. Therefore, \u039a\u03a3 and the line drawn from \u0396 through the body of the planet always proceed in parallel.

Therefore, in accord with our position, let a line be drawn from the planet\u2019s position \u03a9 parallel to \u039a\u03a3, and let this be \u03a9\u039f. We are supposing that the center of the epicycle is at this moment on the line \u03a9\u039f, or some other line nearby and parallel, according as \u03a9 (representing the planet) is closer to or farther from \u039a on the line \u039a\u0396. Let \u03a9\u039f be drawn from whatever point on the line \u039a\u0396 (now, it is \u03a9), equal to \u03a9\u0396. From \u039f let a line be drawn to \u0396\u039a parallel to \u039a\u03a8, and let this be \u039f\u0396. Now since \u0396\u03a9\u039f is equal to \u039a\u03a3\u03a8, and \u039a\u03a3 is imperceptibly greater than \u03a8\u03a3  or \u03a9\u039f (because \u039a\u03a8\u03a3 is right, and the angle at \u03a3 is not greater than 2\u00b0 3\u2019, so that if \u03a8\u03a3 is 100,000, \u039a\u03a3 is 100,064), \u039f\u0396 is also imperceptibly less than \u039a\u03a8. Let \u0396\u0394 be joined, and let a line be drawn at \u039f parallel to \u0396\u0394. Now the moment of time at which the center of the epicycle is placed at \u0396 by Ptolemy and at \u039f by me, is the same, and is designated by both of us by the line \u039a\u03a5 in the theory of the sun. In the theory of Mars, that moment should be designated in the former theory by \u0396\u0394, because \u0394 is the point of equality, while in the new theory it will be designated by a line parallel to \u0396\u0394. Therefore, there will be a new point of equality, about which the time is counted, on this parallel through \u039f. ","707":"Now Ptolemy measured out the courses of the planets, not on the lines \u039a\u03a3, but on the lines \u039a\u03a5 drawn from \u039a parallel to the lines \u03a8\u03a3 passing through the sun\u2019s body. For whenever the planet fell upon these lines \u039a\u03a5 on the side opposite the sun, it was supposed to have shed its second inequality, which fell to it (in Ptolemy\u2019s opinion) because of the epicycle. Then the planet\u2019s sidereal position was sought out by means of instruments, and the center of the epicycle was supposed to be found at that time on the same line. This was done a number of times and at various places on the zodiac: say, \u039a\u0393, \u039a\u03a5, and the points opposite. From three such positions of the planet (or of the center of the epicycle, which, according to Ptolemy, accounts for the second inequality), the practitioner sets out to investigate the hypothesis for the first inequality by comparing these angles which the observed positions form about \u039a, the center of the earth and of observation, with the intervening times. The method for this enterprise is found in Ptolemy Book IX ^19. Now suppose the treatment done, and let the eccentric's line of apsides come out to be \u039a\u039b\u0394\u03a7, with \u0394 the equalizing point, the center of the eccentric upon this line and at point \u039b, and the eccentric \u03a7\u0396. And let this hypothesis correspond to all positions observed at the times of the planet\u2019s opposition to the sun\u2019s mean position.\nHere, the objections I raised against Copernicus concerning the ordering of the physical motion are also not clearly in agreement with Ptolemy. For the center of the epicycle which accounts for the second inequality, here just as the planet itself previously, is borne slowly or swiftly according to its approach  to or recession from the earth \u039a, performed on the circle \u03a7\u0396. Furthermore, to stipulate that there is in the earth \u039a (just as there was before in Copernicus\u2019s sun, the heart of the world) a motive force that drives the centers of this kind of epicycle around, is absurd and monstrous. The hypothesis can also be discredited by another physical argument. For intrinsic to this form of hypothesis, in one way or another, is solidity of the orbs; and since this has been destroyed (by Tycho Brahe\u2019s observations of comets), the hypothesis appears, so to speak, to collapse under its own weight. For a moving force would be declared to reside in the center of the epicycle (not in a body, but in a mathematical point), and to rouse itself to move from place to place, by an unequal amount in equal times; but at the same time would draw the planet along with itself at the distance of the epicycle\u2019s diameter; all the while causing the planet to gyrate around itself, by equal amounts in equal times. That this enormous variety cannot fall to a single moving mind (unless it be God), Aristotle gives supporting arguments in the Metaphysics Book XII Ch. 8: he holds that the individual minds preside over individual, perfectly uniform and simple circular motions. Besides, how will some power sit in a non-body, and flow out of the non-body into the planet? Even if you divide up the tasks, and locate one motive intelligence at the center of the epicycle and another in the body of the planet, the one at the center will use the earth (a body, of course) as its reference, and will move around the earth nonuniformly in a circle, while the one at a point on the circumference (that is, in the planet's body) will move around an incorporeal center and do so uniformly. The question, then, is (as before), by what aids would it move around the incorporeal point? Not by geometrical imagination, for it does not admit of geometrical imagination of itself. Nor can a mobile point subsist in a non-body even in imagination. We humans, in imagining points of this sort, have recourse to the aids of tablets or paper, which we draw upon with our hands or at least remember ourselves to have drawn once. But it likewise cannot happen through a physical flowing of power (which is in the center of the epicycle) out to the circumference and the planet\u2019s body. For we have submitted to this outflow of power on the supposition that the tasks of the compound motions are divided between two minds. Why not also question whether in the first, eccentric motion, some natural force constituted to produce motion might subsist in some point entirely devoid of any body? And even more, whether this kind of incorporeal power can move itself around the earth, and go from place to place? And most of all, whether it can communicate or transfer another's motion through an efflux from itself, although it is not supported by any body that could serve as its nest? Those sublime considerations of the essence, motion, place, and operations of the blessed angels and of separate minds which some people will want to raise in opposition to me, are irrelevant. For we are arguing about natural things which are far inferior in dignity, about powers that exercise no choice of how to vary their action, and about minds which are not in the least separate, since they are yoked and bound to the celestial bodies which they are to bear. These, then, are the general objections that can be raised against  Ptolemy. \nBut something further may be said to Ptolemy, on account of which in particular he would wish to abandon his mean position of the sun and embrace the apparent with us. For if the power moving the planet (whether single or double) acts with respect to the sun, so that it places the planet at the lowest point of the epicycle whenever the center of the epicycle is opposite the sun, I ask (as above) why it looks to the imaginary point \u03a5 (which sometimes precedes and sometimes follows the sun, here marked \u03a3, and is sometimes above and sometimes below it), rather than the sun's body itself? Or how it is that that power can have any perception whatever of the motion of \u03a5 around the earth K, since there is no body at \u03a8? Is it not more probable that the epicycle is restored to the lines \u039a\u03a3 of the sun\u2019s apparent position, when these pass through the center of the epicycle?\n Let us then see what is changed on the eccentric by substitution of the sun\u2019s apparent position. Again (as before) when the sun \u0393, the center of the sun\u2019s eccentric \u03a8, and the earth \u039a are on the same line, so that the line of the sun\u2019s apparent position \u03a8\u0393 and the line of its mean position \u039a\u0393 coincide, then for the center of the epicycle \u03a4 this place remains the same, whether its sidereal position is designated by \u039a\u03a4 or by \u03a8\u03a4, and the planet is really on the line \u039a\u03a4 or \u03a8\u03a4 and at the lowest point on its epicycle \u03a6, since here it is nearest to both \u03a8 and \u039a. The planet is thereby truly divested of its second inequality. But when the sun comes to the side of its eccentric (that is, to the middle distances), a great enough difference arises. For let the sun have gone from \u0393 to \u03a3, and the line of the sun\u2019s mean position \u039a\u03a5 be found in Aries, and the planet\u2019s line of vision \u039a\u03a9 precisely opposite in Libra, so that \u03a5\u039a\u03a9 is a single line. Now since  Ptolemy declared that the planet \u03a9 on this line of vision \u039a\u03a9 is divested of its second inequality, he places the center of the epicycle \u0396 on the line \u039a\u03a9. But since \u039a\u03a3 has gone beyond \u039a\u03a5, the sun\u2019s apparent position is beyond opposition to the planet. And in the last part of the time, \u039a\u03a9 is not descending, so as to be opposite \u039a\u03a3, but ascends towards \u039a\u03a6, because the lowest parts of the epicycle \u03a9 are retrograde and swifter than the center \u0396, and it is there, of course, that the planet is at opposition to the sun. Therefore, this apparent opposition precedes the mean one.\nTherefore, at some time preceding the moment designated by \u039a\u03a5 (let it be \u039a\u0398) when the sun is seen on the line \u039a\u039e, the planet will be seen opposite it (suppose it to be at \u0399) on \u039a\u0399 which forms a straight line with \u039a\u039e. Also, because it is now laid down that it sheds the second inequality at this true opposition, the center of the epicycle will also be seen on this line \u039e\u039a, say at \u039f. And because the planet is retrograde, at the time \u039a\u0398 prior to \u039a\u03a5 the planet is on the line \u039a\u0399 later than at \u039a\u03a9. But \u039a\u0399 and \u039a\u03a9 are parts of the lines \u039a\u039f and \u039a\u0396. Therefore, \u039a\u039f too is more to the east than \u039a\u0396.\nThus it is clear what would be changed on the line of the epicycle\u2019s center by this restoration from the sun\u2019s mean position to its apparent position. For at \u03a4 and the opposite point on the original line the motions of the epicycle\u2019s center remain unchanged. At \u0396 this line, and the center of the epicycle upon it, is moved forward and a subtraction is made from the intervening time. At the opposite place the contrary happens: an addition is made to the time, and the line of motion of the center of the epicycle is moved back westward. And thus these lines of the center of the epicycle differ much from the original lines. For this reason also, when we investigate the causes and measure of the first inequality by a new and repeated operation using these several observed positions of the center of the epicycle (that is, using the observed positions of the planet, after which we suppose the center of the epicycle to lie upon the same line), the outcome of this operation differs much from that of the preceding one. That is, since the time in the semicircle containing the apogee will have been diminished, so that the planet is correspondingly faster, the eccentricity of the equant will come out smaller. And since in the greater quadrant \u0392\u0396 of the semicircle containing the apogee the time will have been diminished by an amount equal to the diminution in the other, smaller part, the planet has been made proportionally much faster in the remaining part of the semicircle. Therefore, the perigee has come closer to the latter, and the apogee has descended from \u03a7 towards \u0396.\nThe quantification of the new hypothesis will be made clear thus. It is presupposed that the planet \u03a9 falls on the line drawn from the center of the epicycle \u0396 through the earth \u039a, only when \u039a\u0396 is collinear with \u039a\u03a3, the sun\u2019s apparent position. Therefore, \u039a\u03a3 and the line drawn from \u0396 through the body of the planet always proceed in parallel. Moreover, we have just taken it from Ptolemy that at the time when the line of the sun\u2019s mean position was \u039a\u03a5, drawn through \u03a9, the planet was observed on the line \u039a\u03a9, and nonetheless we do not grant him that the center of the epicycle \u0396 is on \u039a\u03a9 at the same time. Therefore, in accord with our position, let a line be drawn from the planet\u2019s position \u03a9 parallel to \u039a\u03a3, and let this be \u03a9\u039f. We are supposing that the center of the epicycle is at this moment on the line \u03a9\u039f, or some other line nearby and parallel, according as \u03a9 (representing the planet) is closer to or farther from \u039a on the line \u039a\u0396. Let \u03a9\u039f be drawn from whatever point on the line \u039a\u0396 (now, it is \u03a9), equal to \u03a9\u0396. From \u039f let a line be drawn to \u0396\u039a parallel to \u039a\u03a8, and let this be \u039f\u0396. Now since \u0396\u03a9\u039f is equal to \u039a\u03a3\u03a8, and \u039a\u03a3 is imperceptibly greater than \u03a8\u03a3  or \u03a9\u039f (because \u039a\u03a8\u03a3 is right, and the angle at \u03a3 is not greater than 2\u00b0 3\u2019, so that if \u03a8\u03a3 is 100,000, \u039a\u03a3 is 100,064), \u039f\u0396 is also imperceptibly less than \u039a\u03a8. Let \u0396\u0394 be joined, and let a line be drawn at \u039f parallel to \u0396\u0394. Now the moment of time at which the center of the epicycle is placed at \u0396 by Ptolemy and at \u039f by me, is the same, and is designated by both of us by the line \u039a\u03a5 in the theory of the sun. In the theory of Mars, that moment should be designated in the former theory by \u0396\u0394, because \u0394 is the point of equality, while in the new theory it will be designated by a line parallel to \u0396\u0394. Therefore, there will be a new point of equality, about which the time is counted, on this parallel through \u039f. ","708":"Now Ptolemy measured out the courses of the planets, not on the lines \u039a\u03a3, but on the lines \u039a\u03a5 drawn from \u039a parallel to the lines \u03a8\u03a3 passing through the sun\u2019s body.

But since \u039a\u03a3 has gone beyond \u039a\u03a5, the sun\u2019s apparent position is beyond opposition to the planet. And in the last part of the time, \u039a\u03a9 is not descending, so as to be opposite \u039a\u03a3, but ascends towards \u039a\u03a6, because the lowest parts of the epicycle \u03a9 are retrograde and swifter than the center \u0396, and it is there, of course, that the planet is at opposition to the sun.

We are supposing that the center of the epicycle is at this moment on the line \u03a9\u039f, or some other line nearby and parallel, according as \u03a9 (representing the planet) is closer to or farther from \u039a on the line \u039a\u0396. Let \u03a9\u039f be drawn from whatever point on the line \u039a\u0396 (now, it is \u03a9), equal to \u03a9\u0396. From \u039f let a line be drawn to \u0396\u039a parallel to \u039a\u03a8, and let this be \u039f\u0396. Now since \u0396\u03a9\u039f is equal to \u039a\u03a3\u03a8, and \u039a\u03a3 is imperceptibly greater than \u03a8\u03a3  or \u03a9\u039f (because \u039a\u03a8\u03a3 is right, and the angle at \u03a3 is not greater than 2\u00b0 3\u2019, so that if \u03a8\u03a3 is 100,000, \u039a\u03a3 is 100,064), \u039f\u0396 is also imperceptibly less than \u039a\u03a8. Let \u0396\u0394 be joined, and let a line be drawn at \u039f parallel to \u0396\u0394. Now the moment of time at which the center of the epicycle is placed at \u0396 by Ptolemy and at \u039f by me, is the same, and is designated by both of us by the line \u039a\u03a5 in the theory of the sun. In the theory of Mars, that moment should be designated in the former theory by \u0396\u0394, because \u0394 is the point of equality, while in the new theory it will be designated by a line parallel to \u0396\u0394. Therefore, there will be a new point of equality, about which the time is counted, on this parallel through \u039f.

For whenever the planet fell upon these lines \u039a\u03a5 on the side opposite the sun, it was supposed to have shed its second inequality, which fell to it (in Ptolemy\u2019s opinion) because of the epicycle. Then the planet\u2019s sidereal position was sought out by means of instruments, and the center of the epicycle was supposed to be found at that time on the same line.

Now suppose the treatment done, and let the eccentric's line of apsides come out to be \u039a\u039b\u0394\u03a7, with \u0394 the equalizing point, the center of the eccentric upon this line and at point \u039b, and the eccentric \u03a7\u0396. And let this hypothesis correspond to all positions observed at the times of the planet\u2019s opposition to the sun\u2019s mean position.\nHere, the objections I raised against Copernicus concerning the ordering of the physical motion are also not clearly in agreement with Ptolemy. For the center of the epicycle which accounts for the second inequality, here just as the planet itself previously, is borne slowly or swiftly according to its approach  to or recession from the earth \u039a, performed on the circle \u03a7\u0396. Furthermore, to stipulate that there is in the earth \u039a (just as there was before in Copernicus\u2019s sun, the heart of the world) a motive force that drives the centers of this kind of epicycle around, is absurd and monstrous. The hypothesis can also be discredited by another physical argument. For intrinsic to this form of hypothesis, in one way or another, is solidity of the orbs; and since this has been destroyed (by Tycho Brahe\u2019s observations of comets), the hypothesis appears, so to speak, to collapse under its own weight. For a moving force would be declared to reside in the center of the epicycle (not in a body, but in a mathematical point), and to rouse itself to move from place to place, by an unequal amount in equal times; but at the same time would draw the planet along with itself at the distance of the epicycle\u2019s diameter; all the while causing the planet to gyrate around itself, by equal amounts in equal times. That this enormous variety cannot fall to a single moving mind (unless it be God), Aristotle gives supporting arguments in the Metaphysics Book XII Ch. 8: he holds that the individual minds preside over individual, perfectly uniform and simple circular motions. Besides, how will some power sit in a non-body, and flow out of the non-body into the planet? Even if you divide up the tasks, and locate one motive intelligence at the center of the epicycle and another in the body of the planet, the one at the center will use the earth (a body, of course) as its reference, and will move around the earth nonuniformly in a circle, while the one at a point on the circumference (that is, in the planet's body) will move around an incorporeal center and do so uniformly. The question, then, is (as before), by what aids would it move around the incorporeal point? Not by geometrical imagination, for it does not admit of geometrical imagination of itself. Nor can a mobile point subsist in a non-body even in imagination. We humans, in imagining points of this sort, have recourse to the aids of tablets or paper, which we draw upon with our hands or at least remember ourselves to have drawn once. But it likewise cannot happen through a physical flowing of power (which is in the center of the epicycle) out to the circumference and the planet\u2019s body. For we have submitted to this outflow of power on the supposition that the tasks of the compound motions are divided between two minds. Why not also question whether in the first, eccentric motion, some natural force constituted to produce motion might subsist in some point entirely devoid of any body? And even more, whether this kind of incorporeal power can move itself around the earth, and go from place to place? And most of all, whether it can communicate or transfer another's motion through an efflux from itself, although it is not supported by any body that could serve as its nest? Those sublime considerations of the essence, motion, place, and operations of the blessed angels and of separate minds which some people will want to raise in opposition to me, are irrelevant. For we are arguing about natural things which are far inferior in dignity, about powers that exercise no choice of how to vary their action, and about minds which are not in the least separate, since they are yoked and bound to the celestial bodies which they are to bear. These, then, are the general objections that can be raised against  Ptolemy. \nBut something further may be said to Ptolemy, on account of which in particular he would wish to abandon his mean position of the sun and embrace the apparent with us. For if the power moving the planet (whether single or double) acts with respect to the sun, so that it places the planet at the lowest point of the epicycle whenever the center of the epicycle is opposite the sun, I ask (as above) why it looks to the imaginary point \u03a5 (which sometimes precedes and sometimes follows the sun, here marked \u03a3, and is sometimes above and sometimes below it), rather than the sun's body itself? Or how it is that that power can have any perception whatever of the motion of \u03a5 around the earth K, since there is no body at \u03a8? Is it not more probable that the epicycle is restored to the lines \u039a\u03a3 of the sun\u2019s apparent position, when these pass through the center of the epicycle?\n Let us then see what is changed on the eccentric by substitution of the sun\u2019s apparent position. Again (as before) when the sun \u0393, the center of the sun\u2019s eccentric \u03a8, and the earth \u039a are on the same line, so that the line of the sun\u2019s apparent position \u03a8\u0393 and the line of its mean position \u039a\u0393 coincide, then for the center of the epicycle \u03a4 this place remains the same, whether its sidereal position is designated by \u039a\u03a4 or by \u03a8\u03a4, and the planet is really on the line \u039a\u03a4 or \u03a8\u03a4 and at the lowest point on its epicycle \u03a6, since here it is nearest to both \u03a8 and \u039a. The planet is thereby truly divested of its second inequality. But when the sun comes to the side of its eccentric (that is, to the middle distances), a great enough difference arises. For let the sun have gone from \u0393 to \u03a3, and the line of the sun\u2019s mean position \u039a\u03a5 be found in Aries, and the planet\u2019s line of vision \u039a\u03a9 precisely opposite in Libra, so that \u03a5\u039a\u03a9 is a single line. Now since  Ptolemy declared that the planet \u03a9 on this line of vision \u039a\u03a9 is divested of its second inequality, he places the center of the epicycle \u0396 on the line \u039a\u03a9. But since \u039a\u03a3 has gone beyond \u039a\u03a5, the sun\u2019s apparent position is beyond opposition to the planet. And in the last part of the time, \u039a\u03a9 is not descending, so as to be opposite \u039a\u03a3, but ascends towards \u039a\u03a6, because the lowest parts of the epicycle \u03a9 are retrograde and swifter than the center \u0396, and it is there, of course, that the planet is at opposition to the sun. Therefore, this apparent opposition precedes the mean one.\nTherefore, at some time preceding the moment designated by \u039a\u03a5 (let it be \u039a\u0398) when the sun is seen on the line \u039a\u039e, the planet will be seen opposite it (suppose it to be at \u0399) on \u039a\u0399 which forms a straight line with \u039a\u039e. Also, because it is now laid down that it sheds the second inequality at this true opposition, the center of the epicycle will also be seen on this line \u039e\u039a, say at \u039f. And because the planet is retrograde, at the time \u039a\u0398 prior to \u039a\u03a5 the planet is on the line \u039a\u0399 later than at \u039a\u03a9. But \u039a\u0399 and \u039a\u03a9 are parts of the lines \u039a\u039f and \u039a\u0396. Therefore, \u039a\u039f too is more to the east than \u039a\u0396.\nThus it is clear what would be changed on the line of the epicycle\u2019s center by this restoration from the sun\u2019s mean position to its apparent position. For at \u03a4 and the opposite point on the original line the motions of the epicycle\u2019s center remain unchanged. At \u0396 this line, and the center of the epicycle upon it, is moved forward and a subtraction is made from the intervening time. At the opposite place the contrary happens: an addition is made to the time, and the line of motion of the center of the epicycle is moved back westward. And thus these lines of the center of the epicycle differ much from the original lines. For this reason also, when we investigate the causes and measure of the first inequality by a new and repeated operation using these several observed positions of the center of the epicycle (that is, using the observed positions of the planet, after which we suppose the center of the epicycle to lie upon the same line), the outcome of this operation differs much from that of the preceding one. That is, since the time in the semicircle containing the apogee will have been diminished, so that the planet is correspondingly faster, the eccentricity of the equant will come out smaller. And since in the greater quadrant \u0392\u0396 of the semicircle containing the apogee the time will have been diminished by an amount equal to the diminution in the other, smaller part, the planet has been made proportionally much faster in the remaining part of the semicircle. Therefore, the perigee has come closer to the latter, and the apogee has descended from \u03a7 towards \u0396.\nThe quantification of the new hypothesis will be made clear thus. It is presupposed that the planet \u03a9 falls on the line drawn from the center of the epicycle \u0396 through the earth \u039a, only when \u039a\u0396 is collinear with \u039a\u03a3, the sun\u2019s apparent position. Therefore, \u039a\u03a3 and the line drawn from \u0396 through the body of the planet always proceed in parallel. Moreover, we have just taken it from Ptolemy that at the time when the line of the sun\u2019s mean position was \u039a\u03a5, drawn through \u03a9, the planet was observed on the line \u039a\u03a9, and nonetheless we do not grant him that the center of the epicycle \u0396 is on \u039a\u03a9 at the same time. Therefore, in accord with our position, let a line be drawn from the planet\u2019s position \u03a9 parallel to \u039a\u03a3, and let this be \u03a9\u039f. We are supposing that the center of the epicycle is at this moment on the line \u03a9\u039f, or some other line nearby and parallel, according as \u03a9 (representing the planet) is closer to or farther from \u039a on the line \u039a\u0396. Let \u03a9\u039f be drawn from whatever point on the line \u039a\u0396 (now, it is \u03a9), equal to \u03a9\u0396. From \u039f let a line be drawn to \u0396\u039a parallel to \u039a\u03a8, and let this be \u039f\u0396. Now since \u0396\u03a9\u039f is equal to \u039a\u03a3\u03a8, and \u039a\u03a3 is imperceptibly greater than \u03a8\u03a3  or \u03a9\u039f (because \u039a\u03a8\u03a3 is right, and the angle at \u03a3 is not greater than 2\u00b0 3\u2019, so that if \u03a8\u03a3 is 100,000, \u039a\u03a3 is 100,064), \u039f\u0396 is also imperceptibly less than \u039a\u03a8. Let \u0396\u0394 be joined, and let a line be drawn at \u039f parallel to \u0396\u0394. Now the moment of time at which the center of the epicycle is placed at \u0396 by Ptolemy and at \u039f by me, is the same, and is designated by both of us by the line \u039a\u03a5 in the theory of the sun. In the theory of Mars, that moment should be designated in the former theory by \u0396\u0394, because \u0394 is the point of equality, while in the new theory it will be designated by a line parallel to \u0396\u0394. Therefore, there will be a new point of equality, about which the time is counted, on this parallel through \u039f. ","710":"Now Ptolemy measured out the courses of the planets, not on the lines \u039a\u03a3, but on the lines \u039a\u03a5 drawn from \u039a parallel to the lines \u03a8\u03a3 passing through the sun\u2019s body. For whenever the planet fell upon these lines \u039a\u03a5 on the side opposite the sun, it was supposed to have shed its second inequality, which fell to it (in Ptolemy\u2019s opinion) because of the epicycle. Then the planet\u2019s sidereal position was sought out by means of instruments, and the center of the epicycle was supposed to be found at that time on the same line. This was done a number of times and at various places on the zodiac: say, \u039a\u0393, \u039a\u03a5, and the points opposite. From three such positions of the planet (or of the center of the epicycle, which, according to Ptolemy, accounts for the second inequality), the practitioner sets out to investigate the hypothesis for the first inequality by comparing these angles which the observed positions form about \u039a, the center of the earth and of observation, with the intervening times.

But since \u039a\u03a3 has gone beyond \u039a\u03a5, the sun\u2019s apparent position is beyond opposition to the planet. And in the last part of the time, \u039a\u03a9 is not descending, so as to be opposite \u039a\u03a3, but ascends towards \u039a\u03a6, because the lowest parts of the epicycle \u03a9 are retrograde and swifter than the center \u0396, and it is there, of course, that the planet is at opposition to the sun.

Let \u03a9\u039f be drawn from whatever point on the line \u039a\u0396 (now, it is \u03a9), equal to \u03a9\u0396. From \u039f let a line be drawn to \u0396\u039a parallel to \u039a\u03a8, and let this be \u039f\u0396. Now since \u0396\u03a9\u039f is equal to \u039a\u03a3\u03a8, and \u039a\u03a3 is imperceptibly greater than \u03a8\u03a3  or \u03a9\u039f (because \u039a\u03a8\u03a3 is right, and the angle at \u03a3 is not greater than 2\u00b0 3\u2019, so that if \u03a8\u03a3 is 100,000, \u039a\u03a3 is 100,064), \u039f\u0396 is also imperceptibly less than \u039a\u03a8. Let \u0396\u0394 be joined, and let a line be drawn at \u039f parallel to \u0396\u0394.

For intrinsic to this form of hypothesis, in one way or another, is solidity of the orbs; and since this has been destroyed (by Tycho Brahe\u2019s observations of comets), the hypothesis appears, so to speak, to collapse under its own weight. For a moving force would be declared to reside in the center of the epicycle (not in a body, but in a mathematical point), and to rouse itself to move from place to place, by an unequal amount in equal times; but at the same time would draw the planet along with itself at the distance of the epicycle\u2019s diameter; all the while causing the planet to gyrate around itself, by equal amounts in equal times. That this enormous variety cannot fall to a single moving mind (unless it be God), Aristotle gives supporting arguments in the Metaphysics Book XII Ch. 8: he holds that the individual minds preside over individual, perfectly uniform and simple circular motions. Besides, how will some power sit in a non-body, and flow out of the non-body into the planet? Even if you divide up the tasks, and locate one motive intelligence at the center of the epicycle and another in the body of the planet, the one at the center will use the earth (a body, of course) as its reference, and will move around the earth nonuniformly in a circle, while the one at a point on the circumference (that is, in the planet's body) will move around an incorporeal center and do so uniformly. The question, then, is (as before), by what aids would it move around the incorporeal point? Not by geometrical imagination, for it does not admit of geometrical imagination of itself. Nor can a mobile point subsist in a non-body even in imagination. We humans, in imagining points of this sort, have recourse to the aids of tablets or paper, which we draw upon with our hands or at least remember ourselves to have drawn once. But it likewise cannot happen through a physical flowing of power (which is in the center of the epicycle) out to the circumference and the planet\u2019s body. For we have submitted to this outflow of power on the supposition that the tasks of the compound motions are divided between two minds. Why not also question whether in the first, eccentric motion, some natural force constituted to produce motion might subsist in some point entirely devoid of any body? And even more, whether this kind of incorporeal power can move itself around the earth, and go from place to place? And most of all, whether it can communicate or transfer another's motion through an efflux from itself, although it is not supported by any body that could serve as its nest? Those sublime considerations of the essence, motion, place, and operations of the blessed angels and of separate minds which some people will want to raise in opposition to me, are irrelevant. For we are arguing about natural things which are far inferior in dignity, about powers that exercise no choice of how to vary their action, and about minds which are not in the least separate, since they are yoked and bound to the celestial bodies which they are to bear. These, then, are the general objections that can be raised against  Ptolemy. \nBut something further may be said to Ptolemy, on account of which in particular he would wish to abandon his mean position of the sun and embrace the apparent with us. For if the power moving the planet (whether single or double) acts with respect to the sun, so that it places the planet at the lowest point of the epicycle whenever the center of the epicycle is opposite the sun, I ask (as above) why it looks to the imaginary point \u03a5 (which sometimes precedes and sometimes follows the sun, here marked \u03a3, and is sometimes above and sometimes below it), rather than the sun's body itself? Or how it is that that power can have any perception whatever of the motion of \u03a5 around the earth K, since there is no body at \u03a8? Is it not more probable that the epicycle is restored to the lines \u039a\u03a3 of the sun\u2019s apparent position, when these pass through the center of the epicycle?\n Let us then see what is changed on the eccentric by substitution of the sun\u2019s apparent position. Again (as before) when the sun \u0393, the center of the sun\u2019s eccentric \u03a8, and the earth \u039a are on the same line, so that the line of the sun\u2019s apparent position \u03a8\u0393 and the line of its mean position \u039a\u0393 coincide, then for the center of the epicycle \u03a4 this place remains the same, whether its sidereal position is designated by \u039a\u03a4 or by \u03a8\u03a4, and the planet is really on the line \u039a\u03a4 or \u03a8\u03a4 and at the lowest point on its epicycle \u03a6, since here it is nearest to both \u03a8 and \u039a. The planet is thereby truly divested of its second inequality. But when the sun comes to the side of its eccentric (that is, to the middle distances), a great enough difference arises. For let the sun have gone from \u0393 to \u03a3, and the line of the sun\u2019s mean position \u039a\u03a5 be found in Aries, and the planet\u2019s line of vision \u039a\u03a9 precisely opposite in Libra, so that \u03a5\u039a\u03a9 is a single line. Now since  Ptolemy declared that the planet \u03a9 on this line of vision \u039a\u03a9 is divested of its second inequality, he places the center of the epicycle \u0396 on the line \u039a\u03a9. But since \u039a\u03a3 has gone beyond \u039a\u03a5, the sun\u2019s apparent position is beyond opposition to the planet. And in the last part of the time, \u039a\u03a9 is not descending, so as to be opposite \u039a\u03a3, but ascends towards \u039a\u03a6, because the lowest parts of the epicycle \u03a9 are retrograde and swifter than the center \u0396, and it is there, of course, that the planet is at opposition to the sun. Therefore, this apparent opposition precedes the mean one.\nTherefore, at some time preceding the moment designated by \u039a\u03a5 (let it be \u039a\u0398) when the sun is seen on the line \u039a\u039e, the planet will be seen opposite it (suppose it to be at \u0399) on \u039a\u0399 which forms a straight line with \u039a\u039e. Also, because it is now laid down that it sheds the second inequality at this true opposition, the center of the epicycle will also be seen on this line \u039e\u039a, say at \u039f. And because the planet is retrograde, at the time \u039a\u0398 prior to \u039a\u03a5 the planet is on the line \u039a\u0399 later than at \u039a\u03a9. But \u039a\u0399 and \u039a\u03a9 are parts of the lines \u039a\u039f and \u039a\u0396. Therefore, \u039a\u039f too is more to the east than \u039a\u0396.\nThus it is clear what would be changed on the line of the epicycle\u2019s center by this restoration from the sun\u2019s mean position to its apparent position. For at \u03a4 and the opposite point on the original line the motions of the epicycle\u2019s center remain unchanged. At \u0396 this line, and the center of the epicycle upon it, is moved forward and a subtraction is made from the intervening time. At the opposite place the contrary happens: an addition is made to the time, and the line of motion of the center of the epicycle is moved back westward. And thus these lines of the center of the epicycle differ much from the original lines. For this reason also, when we investigate the causes and measure of the first inequality by a new and repeated operation using these several observed positions of the center of the epicycle (that is, using the observed positions of the planet, after which we suppose the center of the epicycle to lie upon the same line), the outcome of this operation differs much from that of the preceding one. That is, since the time in the semicircle containing the apogee will have been diminished, so that the planet is correspondingly faster, the eccentricity of the equant will come out smaller. And since in the greater quadrant \u0392\u0396 of the semicircle containing the apogee the time will have been diminished by an amount equal to the diminution in the other, smaller part, the planet has been made proportionally much faster in the remaining part of the semicircle. Therefore, the perigee has come closer to the latter, and the apogee has descended from \u03a7 towards \u0396.\nThe quantification of the new hypothesis will be made clear thus. It is presupposed that the planet \u03a9 falls on the line drawn from the center of the epicycle \u0396 through the earth \u039a, only when \u039a\u0396 is collinear with \u039a\u03a3, the sun\u2019s apparent position. Therefore, \u039a\u03a3 and the line drawn from \u0396 through the body of the planet always proceed in parallel. Moreover, we have just taken it from Ptolemy that at the time when the line of the sun\u2019s mean position was \u039a\u03a5, drawn through \u03a9, the planet was observed on the line \u039a\u03a9, and nonetheless we do not grant him that the center of the epicycle \u0396 is on \u039a\u03a9 at the same time. Therefore, in accord with our position, let a line be drawn from the planet\u2019s position \u03a9 parallel to \u039a\u03a3, and let this be \u03a9\u039f. We are supposing that the center of the epicycle is at this moment on the line \u03a9\u039f, or some other line nearby and parallel, according as \u03a9 (representing the planet) is closer to or farther from \u039a on the line \u039a\u0396. Let \u03a9\u039f be drawn from whatever point on the line \u039a\u0396 (now, it is \u03a9), equal to \u03a9\u0396. From \u039f let a line be drawn to \u0396\u039a parallel to \u039a\u03a8, and let this be \u039f\u0396. Now since \u0396\u03a9\u039f is equal to \u039a\u03a3\u03a8, and \u039a\u03a3 is imperceptibly greater than \u03a8\u03a3  or \u03a9\u039f (because \u039a\u03a8\u03a3 is right, and the angle at \u03a3 is not greater than 2\u00b0 3\u2019, so that if \u03a8\u03a3 is 100,000, \u039a\u03a3 is 100,064), \u039f\u0396 is also imperceptibly less than \u039a\u03a8. Let \u0396\u0394 be joined, and let a line be drawn at \u039f parallel to \u0396\u0394. Now the moment of time at which the center of the epicycle is placed at \u0396 by Ptolemy and at \u039f by me, is the same, and is designated by both of us by the line \u039a\u03a5 in the theory of the sun. In the theory of Mars, that moment should be designated in the former theory by \u0396\u0394, because \u0394 is the point of equality, while in the new theory it will be designated by a line parallel to \u0396\u0394. Therefore, there will be a new point of equality, about which the time is counted, on this parallel through \u039f. ","712":"Now Ptolemy measured out the courses of the planets, not on the lines \u039a\u03a3, but on the lines \u039a\u03a5 drawn from \u039a parallel to the lines \u03a8\u03a3 passing through the sun\u2019s body. For whenever the planet fell upon these lines \u039a\u03a5 on the side opposite the sun, it was supposed to have shed its second inequality, which fell to it (in Ptolemy\u2019s opinion) because of the epicycle. Then the planet\u2019s sidereal position was sought out by means of instruments, and the center of the epicycle was supposed to be found at that time on the same line. This was done a number of times and at various places on the zodiac: say, \u039a\u0393, \u039a\u03a5, and the points opposite. From three such positions of the planet (or of the center of the epicycle, which, according to Ptolemy, accounts for the second inequality), the practitioner sets out to investigate the hypothesis for the first inequality by comparing these angles which the observed positions form about \u039a, the center of the earth and of observation, with the intervening times. The method for this enterprise is found in Ptolemy Book IX ^19. Now suppose the treatment done, and let the eccentric's line of apsides come out to be \u039a\u039b\u0394\u03a7, with \u0394 the equalizing point, the center of the eccentric upon this line and at point \u039b, and the eccentric \u03a7\u0396. And let this hypothesis correspond to all positions observed at the times of the planet\u2019s opposition to the sun\u2019s mean position.\nHere, the objections I raised against Copernicus concerning the ordering of the physical motion are also not clearly in agreement with Ptolemy. For the center of the epicycle which accounts for the second inequality, here just as the planet itself previously, is borne slowly or swiftly according to its approach  to or recession from the earth \u039a, performed on the circle \u03a7\u0396. Furthermore, to stipulate that there is in the earth \u039a (just as there was before in Copernicus\u2019s sun, the heart of the world) a motive force that drives the centers of this kind of epicycle around, is absurd and monstrous.

Even if you divide up the tasks, and locate one motive intelligence at the center of the epicycle and another in the body of the planet, the one at the center will use the earth (a body, of course) as its reference, and will move around the earth nonuniformly in a circle, while the one at a point on the circumference (that is, in the planet's body) will move around an incorporeal center and do so uniformly. The question, then, is (as before), by what aids would it move around the incorporeal point? Not by geometrical imagination, for it does not admit of geometrical imagination of itself. Nor can a mobile point subsist in a non-body even in imagination. We humans, in imagining points of this sort, have recourse to the aids of tablets or paper, which we draw upon with our hands or at least remember ourselves to have drawn once. But it likewise cannot happen through a physical flowing of power (which is in the center of the epicycle) out to the circumference and the planet\u2019s body. For we have submitted to this outflow of power on the supposition that the tasks of the compound motions are divided between two minds. Why not also question whether in the first, eccentric motion, some natural force constituted to produce motion might subsist in some point entirely devoid of any body? And even more, whether this kind of incorporeal power can move itself around the earth, and go from place to place? And most of all, whether it can communicate or transfer another's motion through an efflux from itself, although it is not supported by any body that could serve as its nest? Those sublime considerations of the essence, motion, place, and operations of the blessed angels and of separate minds which some people will want to raise in opposition to me, are irrelevant. For we are arguing about natural things which are far inferior in dignity, about powers that exercise no choice of how to vary their action, and about minds which are not in the least separate, since they are yoked and bound to the celestial bodies which they are to bear. These, then, are the general objections that can be raised against  Ptolemy. \nBut something further may be said to Ptolemy, on account of which in particular he would wish to abandon his mean position of the sun and embrace the apparent with us. For if the power moving the planet (whether single or double) acts with respect to the sun, so that it places the planet at the lowest point of the epicycle whenever the center of the epicycle is opposite the sun, I ask (as above) why it looks to the imaginary point \u03a5 (which sometimes precedes and sometimes follows the sun, here marked \u03a3, and is sometimes above and sometimes below it), rather than the sun's body itself? Or how it is that that power can have any perception whatever of the motion of \u03a5 around the earth K, since there is no body at \u03a8? Is it not more probable that the epicycle is restored to the lines \u039a\u03a3 of the sun\u2019s apparent position, when these pass through the center of the epicycle?\n Let us then see what is changed on the eccentric by substitution of the sun\u2019s apparent position. Again (as before) when the sun \u0393, the center of the sun\u2019s eccentric \u03a8, and the earth \u039a are on the same line, so that the line of the sun\u2019s apparent position \u03a8\u0393 and the line of its mean position \u039a\u0393 coincide, then for the center of the epicycle \u03a4 this place remains the same, whether its sidereal position is designated by \u039a\u03a4 or by \u03a8\u03a4, and the planet is really on the line \u039a\u03a4 or \u03a8\u03a4 and at the lowest point on its epicycle \u03a6, since here it is nearest to both \u03a8 and \u039a. The planet is thereby truly divested of its second inequality. But when the sun comes to the side of its eccentric (that is, to the middle distances), a great enough difference arises. For let the sun have gone from \u0393 to \u03a3, and the line of the sun\u2019s mean position \u039a\u03a5 be found in Aries, and the planet\u2019s line of vision \u039a\u03a9 precisely opposite in Libra, so that \u03a5\u039a\u03a9 is a single line. Now since  Ptolemy declared that the planet \u03a9 on this line of vision \u039a\u03a9 is divested of its second inequality, he places the center of the epicycle \u0396 on the line \u039a\u03a9. But since \u039a\u03a3 has gone beyond \u039a\u03a5, the sun\u2019s apparent position is beyond opposition to the planet. And in the last part of the time, \u039a\u03a9 is not descending, so as to be opposite \u039a\u03a3, but ascends towards \u039a\u03a6, because the lowest parts of the epicycle \u03a9 are retrograde and swifter than the center \u0396, and it is there, of course, that the planet is at opposition to the sun. Therefore, this apparent opposition precedes the mean one.\nTherefore, at some time preceding the moment designated by \u039a\u03a5 (let it be \u039a\u0398) when the sun is seen on the line \u039a\u039e, the planet will be seen opposite it (suppose it to be at \u0399) on \u039a\u0399 which forms a straight line with \u039a\u039e. Also, because it is now laid down that it sheds the second inequality at this true opposition, the center of the epicycle will also be seen on this line \u039e\u039a, say at \u039f. And because the planet is retrograde, at the time \u039a\u0398 prior to \u039a\u03a5 the planet is on the line \u039a\u0399 later than at \u039a\u03a9. But \u039a\u0399 and \u039a\u03a9 are parts of the lines \u039a\u039f and \u039a\u0396. Therefore, \u039a\u039f too is more to the east than \u039a\u0396.\nThus it is clear what would be changed on the line of the epicycle\u2019s center by this restoration from the sun\u2019s mean position to its apparent position. For at \u03a4 and the opposite point on the original line the motions of the epicycle\u2019s center remain unchanged. At \u0396 this line, and the center of the epicycle upon it, is moved forward and a subtraction is made from the intervening time. At the opposite place the contrary happens: an addition is made to the time, and the line of motion of the center of the epicycle is moved back westward. And thus these lines of the center of the epicycle differ much from the original lines. For this reason also, when we investigate the causes and measure of the first inequality by a new and repeated operation using these several observed positions of the center of the epicycle (that is, using the observed positions of the planet, after which we suppose the center of the epicycle to lie upon the same line), the outcome of this operation differs much from that of the preceding one. That is, since the time in the semicircle containing the apogee will have been diminished, so that the planet is correspondingly faster, the eccentricity of the equant will come out smaller. And since in the greater quadrant \u0392\u0396 of the semicircle containing the apogee the time will have been diminished by an amount equal to the diminution in the other, smaller part, the planet has been made proportionally much faster in the remaining part of the semicircle. Therefore, the perigee has come closer to the latter, and the apogee has descended from \u03a7 towards \u0396.\nThe quantification of the new hypothesis will be made clear thus. It is presupposed that the planet \u03a9 falls on the line drawn from the center of the epicycle \u0396 through the earth \u039a, only when \u039a\u0396 is collinear with \u039a\u03a3, the sun\u2019s apparent position. Therefore, \u039a\u03a3 and the line drawn from \u0396 through the body of the planet always proceed in parallel. Moreover, we have just taken it from Ptolemy that at the time when the line of the sun\u2019s mean position was \u039a\u03a5, drawn through \u03a9, the planet was observed on the line \u039a\u03a9, and nonetheless we do not grant him that the center of the epicycle \u0396 is on \u039a\u03a9 at the same time. Therefore, in accord with our position, let a line be drawn from the planet\u2019s position \u03a9 parallel to \u039a\u03a3, and let this be \u03a9\u039f. We are supposing that the center of the epicycle is at this moment on the line \u03a9\u039f, or some other line nearby and parallel, according as \u03a9 (representing the planet) is closer to or farther from \u039a on the line \u039a\u0396. Let \u03a9\u039f be drawn from whatever point on the line \u039a\u0396 (now, it is \u03a9), equal to \u03a9\u0396. From \u039f let a line be drawn to \u0396\u039a parallel to \u039a\u03a8, and let this be \u039f\u0396. Now since \u0396\u03a9\u039f is equal to \u039a\u03a3\u03a8, and \u039a\u03a3 is imperceptibly greater than \u03a8\u03a3  or \u03a9\u039f (because \u039a\u03a8\u03a3 is right, and the angle at \u03a3 is not greater than 2\u00b0 3\u2019, so that if \u03a8\u03a3 is 100,000, \u039a\u03a3 is 100,064), \u039f\u0396 is also imperceptibly less than \u039a\u03a8. Let \u0396\u0394 be joined, and let a line be drawn at \u039f parallel to \u0396\u0394. Now the moment of time at which the center of the epicycle is placed at \u0396 by Ptolemy and at \u039f by me, is the same, and is designated by both of us by the line \u039a\u03a5 in the theory of the sun. In the theory of Mars, that moment should be designated in the former theory by \u0396\u0394, because \u0394 is the point of equality, while in the new theory it will be designated by a line parallel to \u0396\u0394. Therefore, there will be a new point of equality, about which the time is counted, on this parallel through \u039f. ","714":"Now Ptolemy measured out the courses of the planets, not on the lines \u039a\u03a3, but on the lines \u039a\u03a5 drawn from \u039a parallel to the lines \u03a8\u03a3 passing through the sun\u2019s body. For whenever the planet fell upon these lines \u039a\u03a5 on the side opposite the sun, it was supposed to have shed its second inequality, which fell to it (in Ptolemy\u2019s opinion) because of the epicycle. Then the planet\u2019s sidereal position was sought out by means of instruments, and the center of the epicycle was supposed to be found at that time on the same line. This was done a number of times and at various places on the zodiac: say, \u039a\u0393, \u039a\u03a5, and the points opposite. From three such positions of the planet (or of the center of the epicycle, which, according to Ptolemy, accounts for the second inequality), the practitioner sets out to investigate the hypothesis for the first inequality by comparing these angles which the observed positions form about \u039a, the center of the earth and of observation, with the intervening times. The method for this enterprise is found in Ptolemy Book IX ^19. Now suppose the treatment done, and let the eccentric's line of apsides come out to be \u039a\u039b\u0394\u03a7, with \u0394 the equalizing point, the center of the eccentric upon this line and at point \u039b, and the eccentric \u03a7\u0396. And let this hypothesis correspond to all positions observed at the times of the planet\u2019s opposition to the sun\u2019s mean position.\nHere, the objections I raised against Copernicus concerning the ordering of the physical motion are also not clearly in agreement with Ptolemy. For the center of the epicycle which accounts for the second inequality, here just as the planet itself previously, is borne slowly or swiftly according to its approach  to or recession from the earth \u039a, performed on the circle \u03a7\u0396. Furthermore, to stipulate that there is in the earth \u039a (just as there was before in Copernicus\u2019s sun, the heart of the world) a motive force that drives the centers of this kind of epicycle around, is absurd and monstrous. The hypothesis can also be discredited by another physical argument. For intrinsic to this form of hypothesis, in one way or another, is solidity of the orbs; and since this has been destroyed (by Tycho Brahe\u2019s observations of comets), the hypothesis appears, so to speak, to collapse under its own weight. For a moving force would be declared to reside in the center of the epicycle (not in a body, but in a mathematical point), and to rouse itself to move from place to place, by an unequal amount in equal times; but at the same time would draw the planet along with itself at the distance of the epicycle\u2019s diameter; all the while causing the planet to gyrate around itself, by equal amounts in equal times. That this enormous variety cannot fall to a single moving mind (unless it be God), Aristotle gives supporting arguments in the Metaphysics Book XII Ch. 8: he holds that the individual minds preside over individual, perfectly uniform and simple circular motions. Besides, how will some power sit in a non-body, and flow out of the non-body into the planet?

But since \u039a\u03a3 has gone beyond \u039a\u03a5, the sun\u2019s apparent position is beyond opposition to the planet. And in the last part of the time, \u039a\u03a9 is not descending, so as to be opposite \u039a\u03a3, but ascends towards \u039a\u03a6, because the lowest parts of the epicycle \u03a9 are retrograde and swifter than the center \u0396, and it is there, of course, that the planet is at opposition to the sun. Therefore, this apparent opposition precedes the mean one.\nTherefore, at some time preceding the moment designated by \u039a\u03a5 (let it be \u039a\u0398) when the sun is seen on the line \u039a\u039e, the planet will be seen opposite it (suppose it to be at \u0399) on \u039a\u0399 which forms a straight line with \u039a\u039e. Also, because it is now laid down that it sheds the second inequality at this true opposition, the center of the epicycle will also be seen on this line \u039e\u039a, say at \u039f. And because the planet is retrograde, at the time \u039a\u0398 prior to \u039a\u03a5 the planet is on the line \u039a\u0399 later than at \u039a\u03a9. But \u039a\u0399 and \u039a\u03a9 are parts of the lines \u039a\u039f and \u039a\u0396. Therefore, \u039a\u039f too is more to the east than \u039a\u0396.\nThus it is clear what would be changed on the line of the epicycle\u2019s center by this restoration from the sun\u2019s mean position to its apparent position. For at \u03a4 and the opposite point on the original line the motions of the epicycle\u2019s center remain unchanged. At \u0396 this line, and the center of the epicycle upon it, is moved forward and a subtraction is made from the intervening time.

From \u039f let a line be drawn to \u0396\u039a parallel to \u039a\u03a8, and let this be \u039f\u0396. Now since \u0396\u03a9\u039f is equal to \u039a\u03a3\u03a8, and \u039a\u03a3 is imperceptibly greater than \u03a8\u03a3  or \u03a9\u039f (because \u039a\u03a8\u03a3 is right, and the angle at \u03a3 is not greater than 2\u00b0 3\u2019, so that if \u03a8\u03a3 is 100,000, \u039a\u03a3 is 100,064), \u039f\u0396 is also imperceptibly less than \u039a\u03a8. Let \u0396\u0394 be joined, and let a line be drawn at \u039f parallel to \u0396\u0394.

And most of all, whether it can communicate or transfer another's motion through an efflux from itself, although it is not supported by any body that could serve as its nest? Those sublime considerations of the essence, motion, place, and operations of the blessed angels and of separate minds which some people will want to raise in opposition to me, are irrelevant. For we are arguing about natural things which are far inferior in dignity, about powers that exercise no choice of how to vary their action, and about minds which are not in the least separate, since they are yoked and bound to the celestial bodies which they are to bear. These, then, are the general objections that can be raised against  Ptolemy. \nBut something further may be said to Ptolemy, on account of which in particular he would wish to abandon his mean position of the sun and embrace the apparent with us. For if the power moving the planet (whether single or double) acts with respect to the sun, so that it places the planet at the lowest point of the epicycle whenever the center of the epicycle is opposite the sun, I ask (as above) why it looks to the imaginary point \u03a5 (which sometimes precedes and sometimes follows the sun, here marked \u03a3, and is sometimes above and sometimes below it), rather than the sun's body itself? Or how it is that that power can have any perception whatever of the motion of \u03a5 around the earth K, since there is no body at \u03a8? Is it not more probable that the epicycle is restored to the lines \u039a\u03a3 of the sun\u2019s apparent position, when these pass through the center of the epicycle?\n Let us then see what is changed on the eccentric by substitution of the sun\u2019s apparent position. Again (as before) when the sun \u0393, the center of the sun\u2019s eccentric \u03a8, and the earth \u039a are on the same line, so that the line of the sun\u2019s apparent position \u03a8\u0393 and the line of its mean position \u039a\u0393 coincide, then for the center of the epicycle \u03a4 this place remains the same, whether its sidereal position is designated by \u039a\u03a4 or by \u03a8\u03a4, and the planet is really on the line \u039a\u03a4 or \u03a8\u03a4 and at the lowest point on its epicycle \u03a6, since here it is nearest to both \u03a8 and \u039a. The planet is thereby truly divested of its second inequality. But when the sun comes to the side of its eccentric (that is, to the middle distances), a great enough difference arises. For let the sun have gone from \u0393 to \u03a3, and the line of the sun\u2019s mean position \u039a\u03a5 be found in Aries, and the planet\u2019s line of vision \u039a\u03a9 precisely opposite in Libra, so that \u03a5\u039a\u03a9 is a single line. Now since  Ptolemy declared that the planet \u03a9 on this line of vision \u039a\u03a9 is divested of its second inequality, he places the center of the epicycle \u0396 on the line \u039a\u03a9. But since \u039a\u03a3 has gone beyond \u039a\u03a5, the sun\u2019s apparent position is beyond opposition to the planet. And in the last part of the time, \u039a\u03a9 is not descending, so as to be opposite \u039a\u03a3, but ascends towards \u039a\u03a6, because the lowest parts of the epicycle \u03a9 are retrograde and swifter than the center \u0396, and it is there, of course, that the planet is at opposition to the sun. Therefore, this apparent opposition precedes the mean one.\nTherefore, at some time preceding the moment designated by \u039a\u03a5 (let it be \u039a\u0398) when the sun is seen on the line \u039a\u039e, the planet will be seen opposite it (suppose it to be at \u0399) on \u039a\u0399 which forms a straight line with \u039a\u039e. Also, because it is now laid down that it sheds the second inequality at this true opposition, the center of the epicycle will also be seen on this line \u039e\u039a, say at \u039f. And because the planet is retrograde, at the time \u039a\u0398 prior to \u039a\u03a5 the planet is on the line \u039a\u0399 later than at \u039a\u03a9. But \u039a\u0399 and \u039a\u03a9 are parts of the lines \u039a\u039f and \u039a\u0396. Therefore, \u039a\u039f too is more to the east than \u039a\u0396.\nThus it is clear what would be changed on the line of the epicycle\u2019s center by this restoration from the sun\u2019s mean position to its apparent position. For at \u03a4 and the opposite point on the original line the motions of the epicycle\u2019s center remain unchanged. At \u0396 this line, and the center of the epicycle upon it, is moved forward and a subtraction is made from the intervening time. At the opposite place the contrary happens: an addition is made to the time, and the line of motion of the center of the epicycle is moved back westward. And thus these lines of the center of the epicycle differ much from the original lines. For this reason also, when we investigate the causes and measure of the first inequality by a new and repeated operation using these several observed positions of the center of the epicycle (that is, using the observed positions of the planet, after which we suppose the center of the epicycle to lie upon the same line), the outcome of this operation differs much from that of the preceding one. That is, since the time in the semicircle containing the apogee will have been diminished, so that the planet is correspondingly faster, the eccentricity of the equant will come out smaller. And since in the greater quadrant \u0392\u0396 of the semicircle containing the apogee the time will have been diminished by an amount equal to the diminution in the other, smaller part, the planet has been made proportionally much faster in the remaining part of the semicircle. Therefore, the perigee has come closer to the latter, and the apogee has descended from \u03a7 towards \u0396.\nThe quantification of the new hypothesis will be made clear thus. It is presupposed that the planet \u03a9 falls on the line drawn from the center of the epicycle \u0396 through the earth \u039a, only when \u039a\u0396 is collinear with \u039a\u03a3, the sun\u2019s apparent position. Therefore, \u039a\u03a3 and the line drawn from \u0396 through the body of the planet always proceed in parallel. Moreover, we have just taken it from Ptolemy that at the time when the line of the sun\u2019s mean position was \u039a\u03a5, drawn through \u03a9, the planet was observed on the line \u039a\u03a9, and nonetheless we do not grant him that the center of the epicycle \u0396 is on \u039a\u03a9 at the same time. Therefore, in accord with our position, let a line be drawn from the planet\u2019s position \u03a9 parallel to \u039a\u03a3, and let this be \u03a9\u039f. We are supposing that the center of the epicycle is at this moment on the line \u03a9\u039f, or some other line nearby and parallel, according as \u03a9 (representing the planet) is closer to or farther from \u039a on the line \u039a\u0396. Let \u03a9\u039f be drawn from whatever point on the line \u039a\u0396 (now, it is \u03a9), equal to \u03a9\u0396. From \u039f let a line be drawn to \u0396\u039a parallel to \u039a\u03a8, and let this be \u039f\u0396. Now since \u0396\u03a9\u039f is equal to \u039a\u03a3\u03a8, and \u039a\u03a3 is imperceptibly greater than \u03a8\u03a3  or \u03a9\u039f (because \u039a\u03a8\u03a3 is right, and the angle at \u03a3 is not greater than 2\u00b0 3\u2019, so that if \u03a8\u03a3 is 100,000, \u039a\u03a3 is 100,064), \u039f\u0396 is also imperceptibly less than \u039a\u03a8. Let \u0396\u0394 be joined, and let a line be drawn at \u039f parallel to \u0396\u0394. Now the moment of time at which the center of the epicycle is placed at \u0396 by Ptolemy and at \u039f by me, is the same, and is designated by both of us by the line \u039a\u03a5 in the theory of the sun. In the theory of Mars, that moment should be designated in the former theory by \u0396\u0394, because \u0394 is the point of equality, while in the new theory it will be designated by a line parallel to \u0396\u0394. Therefore, there will be a new point of equality, about which the time is counted, on this parallel through \u039f. ","716":"Now Ptolemy measured out the courses of the planets, not on the lines \u039a\u03a3, but on the lines \u039a\u03a5 drawn from \u039a parallel to the lines \u03a8\u03a3 passing through the sun\u2019s body. For whenever the planet fell upon these lines \u039a\u03a5 on the side opposite the sun, it was supposed to have shed its second inequality, which fell to it (in Ptolemy\u2019s opinion) because of the epicycle. Then the planet\u2019s sidereal position was sought out by means of instruments, and the center of the epicycle was supposed to be found at that time on the same line. This was done a number of times and at various places on the zodiac: say, \u039a\u0393, \u039a\u03a5, and the points opposite. From three such positions of the planet (or of the center of the epicycle, which, according to Ptolemy, accounts for the second inequality), the practitioner sets out to investigate the hypothesis for the first inequality by comparing these angles which the observed positions form about \u039a, the center of the earth and of observation, with the intervening times. The method for this enterprise is found in Ptolemy Book IX ^19. Now suppose the treatment done, and let the eccentric's line of apsides come out to be \u039a\u039b\u0394\u03a7, with \u0394 the equalizing point, the center of the eccentric upon this line and at point \u039b, and the eccentric \u03a7\u0396. And let this hypothesis correspond to all positions observed at the times of the planet\u2019s opposition to the sun\u2019s mean position.\nHere, the objections I raised against Copernicus concerning the ordering of the physical motion are also not clearly in agreement with Ptolemy. For the center of the epicycle which accounts for the second inequality, here just as the planet itself previously, is borne slowly or swiftly according to its approach  to or recession from the earth \u039a, performed on the circle \u03a7\u0396. Furthermore, to stipulate that there is in the earth \u039a (just as there was before in Copernicus\u2019s sun, the heart of the world) a motive force that drives the centers of this kind of epicycle around, is absurd and monstrous. The hypothesis can also be discredited by another physical argument. For intrinsic to this form of hypothesis, in one way or another, is solidity of the orbs; and since this has been destroyed (by Tycho Brahe\u2019s observations of comets), the hypothesis appears, so to speak, to collapse under its own weight. For a moving force would be declared to reside in the center of the epicycle (not in a body, but in a mathematical point), and to rouse itself to move from place to place, by an unequal amount in equal times; but at the same time would draw the planet along with itself at the distance of the epicycle\u2019s diameter; all the while causing the planet to gyrate around itself, by equal amounts in equal times. That this enormous variety cannot fall to a single moving mind (unless it be God), Aristotle gives supporting arguments in the Metaphysics Book XII Ch. 8: he holds that the individual minds preside over individual, perfectly uniform and simple circular motions. Besides, how will some power sit in a non-body, and flow out of the non-body into the planet? Even if you divide up the tasks, and locate one motive intelligence at the center of the epicycle and another in the body of the planet, the one at the center will use the earth (a body, of course) as its reference, and will move around the earth nonuniformly in a circle, while the one at a point on the circumference (that is, in the planet's body) will move around an incorporeal center and do so uniformly. The question, then, is (as before), by what aids would it move around the incorporeal point? Not by geometrical imagination, for it does not admit of geometrical imagination of itself. Nor can a mobile point subsist in a non-body even in imagination. We humans, in imagining points of this sort, have recourse to the aids of tablets or paper, which we draw upon with our hands or at least remember ourselves to have drawn once. But it likewise cannot happen through a physical flowing of power (which is in the center of the epicycle) out to the circumference and the planet\u2019s body. For we have submitted to this outflow of power on the supposition that the tasks of the compound motions are divided between two minds. Why not also question whether in the first, eccentric motion, some natural force constituted to produce motion might subsist in some point entirely devoid of any body? And even more, whether this kind of incorporeal power can move itself around the earth, and go from place to place? And most of all, whether it can communicate or transfer another's motion through an efflux from itself, although it is not supported by any body that could serve as its nest?

Is it not more probable that the epicycle is restored to the lines \u039a\u03a3 of the sun\u2019s apparent position, when these pass through the center of the epicycle?\n Let us then see what is changed on the eccentric by substitution of the sun\u2019s apparent position.

The planet is thereby truly divested of its second inequality. But when the sun comes to the side of its eccentric (that is, to the middle distances), a great enough difference arises.

Now since  Ptolemy declared that the planet \u03a9 on this line of vision \u039a\u03a9 is divested of its second inequality, he places the center of the epicycle \u0396 on the line \u039a\u03a9. But since \u039a\u03a3 has gone beyond \u039a\u03a5, the sun\u2019s apparent position is beyond opposition to the planet. And in the last part of the time, \u039a\u03a9 is not descending, so as to be opposite \u039a\u03a3, but ascends towards \u039a\u03a6, because the lowest parts of the epicycle \u03a9 are retrograde and swifter than the center \u0396, and it is there, of course, that the planet is at opposition to the sun. Therefore, this apparent opposition precedes the mean one.\nTherefore, at some time preceding the moment designated by \u039a\u03a5 (let it be \u039a\u0398) when the sun is seen on the line \u039a\u039e, the planet will be seen opposite it (suppose it to be at \u0399) on \u039a\u0399 which forms a straight line with \u039a\u039e. Also, because it is now laid down that it sheds the second inequality at this true opposition, the center of the epicycle will also be seen on this line \u039e\u039a, say at \u039f. And because the planet is retrograde, at the time \u039a\u0398 prior to \u039a\u03a5 the planet is on the line \u039a\u0399 later than at \u039a\u03a9. But \u039a\u0399 and \u039a\u03a9 are parts of the lines \u039a\u039f and \u039a\u0396. Therefore, \u039a\u039f too is more to the east than \u039a\u0396.\nThus it is clear what would be changed on the line of the epicycle\u2019s center by this restoration from the sun\u2019s mean position to its apparent position. For at \u03a4 and the opposite point on the original line the motions of the epicycle\u2019s center remain unchanged.

Let \u03a9\u039f be drawn from whatever point on the line \u039a\u0396 (now, it is \u03a9), equal to \u03a9\u0396. From \u039f let a line be drawn to \u0396\u039a parallel to \u039a\u03a8, and let this be \u039f\u0396. Now since \u0396\u03a9\u039f is equal to \u039a\u03a3\u03a8, and \u039a\u03a3 is imperceptibly greater than \u03a8\u03a3  or \u03a9\u039f (because \u039a\u03a8\u03a3 is right, and the angle at \u03a3 is not greater than 2\u00b0 3\u2019, so that if \u03a8\u03a3 is 100,000, \u039a\u03a3 is 100,064), \u039f\u0396 is also imperceptibly less than \u039a\u03a8. Let \u0396\u0394 be joined, and let a line be drawn at \u039f parallel to \u0396\u0394.

Is it not more probable that the epicycle is restored to the lines \u039a\u03a3 of the sun\u2019s apparent position, when these pass through the center of the epicycle?\n Let us then see what is changed on the eccentric by substitution of the sun\u2019s apparent position. Again (as before) when the sun \u0393, the center of the sun\u2019s eccentric \u03a8, and the earth \u039a are on the same line, so that the line of the sun\u2019s apparent position \u03a8\u0393 and the line of its mean position \u039a\u0393 coincide, then for the center of the epicycle \u03a4 this place remains the same, whether its sidereal position is designated by \u039a\u03a4 or by \u03a8\u03a4, and the planet is really on the line \u039a\u03a4 or \u03a8\u03a4 and at the lowest point on its epicycle \u03a6, since here it is nearest to both \u03a8 and \u039a. The planet is thereby truly divested of its second inequality. But when the sun comes to the side of its eccentric (that is, to the middle distances), a great enough difference arises. For let the sun have gone from \u0393 to \u03a3, and the line of the sun\u2019s mean position \u039a\u03a5 be found in Aries, and the planet\u2019s line of vision \u039a\u03a9 precisely opposite in Libra, so that \u03a5\u039a\u03a9 is a single line. Now since  Ptolemy declared that the planet \u03a9 on this line of vision \u039a\u03a9 is divested of its second inequality, he places the center of the epicycle \u0396 on the line \u039a\u03a9. But since \u039a\u03a3 has gone beyond \u039a\u03a5, the sun\u2019s apparent position is beyond opposition to the planet. And in the last part of the time, \u039a\u03a9 is not descending, so as to be opposite \u039a\u03a3, but ascends towards \u039a\u03a6, because the lowest parts of the epicycle \u03a9 are retrograde and swifter than the center \u0396, and it is there, of course, that the planet is at opposition to the sun. Therefore, this apparent opposition precedes the mean one.\nTherefore, at some time preceding the moment designated by \u039a\u03a5 (let it be \u039a\u0398) when the sun is seen on the line \u039a\u039e, the planet will be seen opposite it (suppose it to be at \u0399) on \u039a\u0399 which forms a straight line with \u039a\u039e. Also, because it is now laid down that it sheds the second inequality at this true opposition, the center of the epicycle will also be seen on this line \u039e\u039a, say at \u039f. And because the planet is retrograde, at the time \u039a\u0398 prior to \u039a\u03a5 the planet is on the line \u039a\u0399 later than at \u039a\u03a9. But \u039a\u0399 and \u039a\u03a9 are parts of the lines \u039a\u039f and \u039a\u0396. Therefore, \u039a\u039f too is more to the east than \u039a\u0396.\nThus it is clear what would be changed on the line of the epicycle\u2019s center by this restoration from the sun\u2019s mean position to its apparent position. For at \u03a4 and the opposite point on the original line the motions of the epicycle\u2019s center remain unchanged. At \u0396 this line, and the center of the epicycle upon it, is moved forward and a subtraction is made from the intervening time. At the opposite place the contrary happens: an addition is made to the time, and the line of motion of the center of the epicycle is moved back westward. And thus these lines of the center of the epicycle differ much from the original lines. For this reason also, when we investigate the causes and measure of the first inequality by a new and repeated operation using these several observed positions of the center of the epicycle (that is, using the observed positions of the planet, after which we suppose the center of the epicycle to lie upon the same line), the outcome of this operation differs much from that of the preceding one. That is, since the time in the semicircle containing the apogee will have been diminished, so that the planet is correspondingly faster, the eccentricity of the equant will come out smaller. And since in the greater quadrant \u0392\u0396 of the semicircle containing the apogee the time will have been diminished by an amount equal to the diminution in the other, smaller part, the planet has been made proportionally much faster in the remaining part of the semicircle. Therefore, the perigee has come closer to the latter, and the apogee has descended from \u03a7 towards \u0396.\nThe quantification of the new hypothesis will be made clear thus. It is presupposed that the planet \u03a9 falls on the line drawn from the center of the epicycle \u0396 through the earth \u039a, only when \u039a\u0396 is collinear with \u039a\u03a3, the sun\u2019s apparent position. Therefore, \u039a\u03a3 and the line drawn from \u0396 through the body of the planet always proceed in parallel. Moreover, we have just taken it from Ptolemy that at the time when the line of the sun\u2019s mean position was \u039a\u03a5, drawn through \u03a9, the planet was observed on the line \u039a\u03a9, and nonetheless we do not grant him that the center of the epicycle \u0396 is on \u039a\u03a9 at the same time. Therefore, in accord with our position, let a line be drawn from the planet\u2019s position \u03a9 parallel to \u039a\u03a3, and let this be \u03a9\u039f. We are supposing that the center of the epicycle is at this moment on the line \u03a9\u039f, or some other line nearby and parallel, according as \u03a9 (representing the planet) is closer to or farther from \u039a on the line \u039a\u0396. Let \u03a9\u039f be drawn from whatever point on the line \u039a\u0396 (now, it is \u03a9), equal to \u03a9\u0396. From \u039f let a line be drawn to \u0396\u039a parallel to \u039a\u03a8, and let this be \u039f\u0396. Now since \u0396\u03a9\u039f is equal to \u039a\u03a3\u03a8, and \u039a\u03a3 is imperceptibly greater than \u03a8\u03a3  or \u03a9\u039f (because \u039a\u03a8\u03a3 is right, and the angle at \u03a3 is not greater than 2\u00b0 3\u2019, so that if \u03a8\u03a3 is 100,000, \u039a\u03a3 is 100,064), \u039f\u0396 is also imperceptibly less than \u039a\u03a8. Let \u0396\u0394 be joined, and let a line be drawn at \u039f parallel to \u0396\u0394. Now the moment of time at which the center of the epicycle is placed at \u0396 by Ptolemy and at \u039f by me, is the same, and is designated by both of us by the line \u039a\u03a5 in the theory of the sun. In the theory of Mars, that moment should be designated in the former theory by \u0396\u0394, because \u0394 is the point of equality, while in the new theory it will be designated by a line parallel to \u0396\u0394. Therefore, there will be a new point of equality, about which the time is counted, on this parallel through \u039f. ","718":"Now Ptolemy measured out the courses of the planets, not on the lines \u039a\u03a3, but on the lines \u039a\u03a5 drawn from \u039a parallel to the lines \u03a8\u03a3 passing through the sun\u2019s body. For whenever the planet fell upon these lines \u039a\u03a5 on the side opposite the sun, it was supposed to have shed its second inequality, which fell to it (in Ptolemy\u2019s opinion) because of the epicycle. Then the planet\u2019s sidereal position was sought out by means of instruments, and the center of the epicycle was supposed to be found at that time on the same line. This was done a number of times and at various places on the zodiac: say, \u039a\u0393, \u039a\u03a5, and the points opposite. From three such positions of the planet (or of the center of the epicycle, which, according to Ptolemy, accounts for the second inequality), the practitioner sets out to investigate the hypothesis for the first inequality by comparing these angles which the observed positions form about \u039a, the center of the earth and of observation, with the intervening times. The method for this enterprise is found in Ptolemy Book IX ^19. Now suppose the treatment done, and let the eccentric's line of apsides come out to be \u039a\u039b\u0394\u03a7, with \u0394 the equalizing point, the center of the eccentric upon this line and at point \u039b, and the eccentric \u03a7\u0396. And let this hypothesis correspond to all positions observed at the times of the planet\u2019s opposition to the sun\u2019s mean position.\nHere, the objections I raised against Copernicus concerning the ordering of the physical motion are also not clearly in agreement with Ptolemy. For the center of the epicycle which accounts for the second inequality, here just as the planet itself previously, is borne slowly or swiftly according to its approach  to or recession from the earth \u039a, performed on the circle \u03a7\u0396. Furthermore, to stipulate that there is in the earth \u039a (just as there was before in Copernicus\u2019s sun, the heart of the world) a motive force that drives the centers of this kind of epicycle around, is absurd and monstrous. The hypothesis can also be discredited by another physical argument. For intrinsic to this form of hypothesis, in one way or another, is solidity of the orbs; and since this has been destroyed (by Tycho Brahe\u2019s observations of comets), the hypothesis appears, so to speak, to collapse under its own weight. For a moving force would be declared to reside in the center of the epicycle (not in a body, but in a mathematical point), and to rouse itself to move from place to place, by an unequal amount in equal times; but at the same time would draw the planet along with itself at the distance of the epicycle\u2019s diameter; all the while causing the planet to gyrate around itself, by equal amounts in equal times. That this enormous variety cannot fall to a single moving mind (unless it be God), Aristotle gives supporting arguments in the Metaphysics Book XII Ch. 8: he holds that the individual minds preside over individual, perfectly uniform and simple circular motions. Besides, how will some power sit in a non-body, and flow out of the non-body into the planet? Even if you divide up the tasks, and locate one motive intelligence at the center of the epicycle and another in the body of the planet, the one at the center will use the earth (a body, of course) as its reference, and will move around the earth nonuniformly in a circle, while the one at a point on the circumference (that is, in the planet's body) will move around an incorporeal center and do so uniformly. The question, then, is (as before), by what aids would it move around the incorporeal point? Not by geometrical imagination, for it does not admit of geometrical imagination of itself. Nor can a mobile point subsist in a non-body even in imagination. We humans, in imagining points of this sort, have recourse to the aids of tablets or paper, which we draw upon with our hands or at least remember ourselves to have drawn once. But it likewise cannot happen through a physical flowing of power (which is in the center of the epicycle) out to the circumference and the planet\u2019s body. For we have submitted to this outflow of power on the supposition that the tasks of the compound motions are divided between two minds. Why not also question whether in the first, eccentric motion, some natural force constituted to produce motion might subsist in some point entirely devoid of any body? And even more, whether this kind of incorporeal power can move itself around the earth, and go from place to place? And most of all, whether it can communicate or transfer another's motion through an efflux from itself, although it is not supported by any body that could serve as its nest? Those sublime considerations of the essence, motion, place, and operations of the blessed angels and of separate minds which some people will want to raise in opposition to me, are irrelevant. For we are arguing about natural things which are far inferior in dignity, about powers that exercise no choice of how to vary their action, and about minds which are not in the least separate, since they are yoked and bound to the celestial bodies which they are to bear. These, then, are the general objections that can be raised against  Ptolemy. \nBut something further may be said to Ptolemy, on account of which in particular he would wish to abandon his mean position of the sun and embrace the apparent with us. For if the power moving the planet (whether single or double) acts with respect to the sun, so that it places the planet at the lowest point of the epicycle whenever the center of the epicycle is opposite the sun, I ask (as above) why it looks to the imaginary point \u03a5 (which sometimes precedes and sometimes follows the sun, here marked \u03a3, and is sometimes above and sometimes below it), rather than the sun's body itself? Or how it is that that power can have any perception whatever of the motion of \u03a5 around the earth K, since there is no body at \u03a8? Is it not more probable that the epicycle is restored to the lines \u039a\u03a3 of the sun\u2019s apparent position, when these pass through the center of the epicycle?\n Let us then see what is changed on the eccentric by substitution of the sun\u2019s apparent position. Again (as before) when the sun \u0393, the center of the sun\u2019s eccentric \u03a8, and the earth \u039a are on the same line, so that the line of the sun\u2019s apparent position \u03a8\u0393 and the line of its mean position \u039a\u0393 coincide, then for the center of the epicycle \u03a4 this place remains the same, whether its sidereal position is designated by \u039a\u03a4 or by \u03a8\u03a4, and the planet is really on the line \u039a\u03a4 or \u03a8\u03a4 and at the lowest point on its epicycle \u03a6, since here it is nearest to both \u03a8 and \u039a. The planet is thereby truly divested of its second inequality. But when the sun comes to the side of its eccentric (that is, to the middle distances), a great enough difference arises. For let the sun have gone from \u0393 to \u03a3, and the line of the sun\u2019s mean position \u039a\u03a5 be found in Aries, and the planet\u2019s line of vision \u039a\u03a9 precisely opposite in Libra, so that \u03a5\u039a\u03a9 is a single line. Now since  Ptolemy declared that the planet \u03a9 on this line of vision \u039a\u03a9 is divested of its second inequality, he places the center of the epicycle \u0396 on the line \u039a\u03a9. But since \u039a\u03a3 has gone beyond \u039a\u03a5, the sun\u2019s apparent position is beyond opposition to the planet. And in the last part of the time, \u039a\u03a9 is not descending, so as to be opposite \u039a\u03a3, but ascends towards \u039a\u03a6, because the lowest parts of the epicycle \u03a9 are retrograde and swifter than the center \u0396, and it is there, of course, that the planet is at opposition to the sun. Therefore, this apparent opposition precedes the mean one.\nTherefore, at some time preceding the moment designated by \u039a\u03a5 (let it be \u039a\u0398) when the sun is seen on the line \u039a\u039e, the planet will be seen opposite it (suppose it to be at \u0399) on \u039a\u0399 which forms a straight line with \u039a\u039e. Also, because it is now laid down that it sheds the second inequality at this true opposition, the center of the epicycle will also be seen on this line \u039e\u039a, say at \u039f. And because the planet is retrograde, at the time \u039a\u0398 prior to \u039a\u03a5 the planet is on the line \u039a\u0399 later than at \u039a\u03a9. But \u039a\u0399 and \u039a\u03a9 are parts of the lines \u039a\u039f and \u039a\u0396. Therefore, \u039a\u039f too is more to the east than \u039a\u0396.\nThus it is clear what would be changed on the line of the epicycle\u2019s center by this restoration from the sun\u2019s mean position to its apparent position. For at \u03a4 and the opposite point on the original line the motions of the epicycle\u2019s center remain unchanged. At \u0396 this line, and the center of the epicycle upon it, is moved forward and a subtraction is made from the intervening time. At the opposite place the contrary happens: an addition is made to the time, and the line of motion of the center of the epicycle is moved back westward. And thus these lines of the center of the epicycle differ much from the original lines. For this reason also, when we investigate the causes and measure of the first inequality by a new and repeated operation using these several observed positions of the center of the epicycle (that is, using the observed positions of the planet, after which we suppose the center of the epicycle to lie upon the same line), the outcome of this operation differs much from that of the preceding one. That is, since the time in the semicircle containing the apogee will have been diminished, so that the planet is correspondingly faster, the eccentricity of the equant will come out smaller. And since in the greater quadrant \u0392\u0396 of the semicircle containing the apogee the time will have been diminished by an amount equal to the diminution in the other, smaller part, the planet has been made proportionally much faster in the remaining part of the semicircle. Therefore, the perigee has come closer to the latter, and the apogee has descended from \u03a7 towards \u0396.\nThe quantification of the new hypothesis will be made clear thus. It is presupposed that the planet \u03a9 falls on the line drawn from the center of the epicycle \u0396 through the earth \u039a, only when \u039a\u0396 is collinear with \u039a\u03a3, the sun\u2019s apparent position. Therefore, \u039a\u03a3 and the line drawn from \u0396 through the body of the planet always proceed in parallel. Moreover, we have just taken it from Ptolemy that at the time when the line of the sun\u2019s mean position was \u039a\u03a5, drawn through \u03a9, the planet was observed on the line \u039a\u03a9, and nonetheless we do not grant him that the center of the epicycle \u0396 is on \u039a\u03a9 at the same time. Therefore, in accord with our position, let a line be drawn from the planet\u2019s position \u03a9 parallel to \u039a\u03a3, and let this be \u03a9\u039f. We are supposing that the center of the epicycle is at this moment on the line \u03a9\u039f, or some other line nearby and parallel, according as \u03a9 (representing the planet) is closer to or farther from \u039a on the line \u039a\u0396. Let \u03a9\u039f be drawn from whatever point on the line \u039a\u0396 (now, it is \u03a9), equal to \u03a9\u0396. From \u039f let a line be drawn to \u0396\u039a parallel to \u039a\u03a8, and let this be \u039f\u0396. Now since \u0396\u03a9\u039f is equal to \u039a\u03a3\u03a8, and \u039a\u03a3 is imperceptibly greater than \u03a8\u03a3  or \u03a9\u039f (because \u039a\u03a8\u03a3 is right, and the angle at \u03a3 is not greater than 2\u00b0 3\u2019, so that if \u03a8\u03a3 is 100,000, \u039a\u03a3 is 100,064), \u039f\u0396 is also imperceptibly less than \u039a\u03a8. Let \u0396\u0394 be joined, and let a line be drawn at \u039f parallel to \u0396\u0394. Now the moment of time at which the center of the epicycle is placed at \u0396 by Ptolemy and at \u039f by me, is the same, and is designated by both of us by the line \u039a\u03a5 in the theory of the sun. In the theory of Mars, that moment should be designated in the former theory by \u0396\u0394, because \u0394 is the point of equality, while in the new theory it will be designated by a line parallel to \u0396\u0394. Therefore, there will be a new point of equality, about which the time is counted, on this parallel through \u039f. ","719":"Further, the same things occur when the center of the epicycle (in Ptolemy's account) is at the other end of the line of the sun\u2019s mean position in the neighborhood of \u039a\u03a5 (which, for the sake of brevity, I shall not prove). Therefore, if some line is again drawn parallel to the Ptolemaic line of the mean position of the center of the epicycle, a line \u0394\u0394 drawn from \u0394 to where the two new parallels intersect will be parallel to \u0396\u039f or \u03a8\u039a, equal to \u0396\u039f, and very nearly equal to \u03a8\u039a, and the new \u0394 will be the common point of equality in the new hypothesis.

Let such a new eccentric be described about \u039c, equal to the former, and let \u039a\u039c be extended in both directions. The new apogee will be \u0397, and the center of the epicycle will be on the points \u0392, \u039f, of the new eccentric, with the planet nearer at \u0391 and farther at \u0399 than before. However, in positions in which the second inequality is involved, the former observations are thoroughly and vehemently perturbed by this new eccentric introduced into their hypothesis. (This is clearly so if an epicycle equal to the sun\u2019s eccentric is attributed to the planet, as it must be if we wish to carry over the force of Copernicus\u2019s and Tycho\u2019s discoveries into the Ptolemaic form.) The reason is not that the point of equality \u0394 does not remain the same, but that near the positions of the sun\u2019s apsides the centers of the two eccentrics, the Ptolemaic and ours, are distant by an interval \u039b\u039c. Also, from this distance of the centers there necessarily follows an equal distance of the positions of the planetary body. Furthermore, this discrepancy is not greatest when the center of the epicycle is about the sun\u2019s middle distances. For it has been said that at those places the position of the center of the epicycle on either eccentric is nearly the same, even though they stand apart by parallels from \u0394\u0394. It is therefore greatest near the sun\u2019s apsides, and greater near perigee on \u039c\u039b extended so as to intersect the eccentrics at \u03a1 and \u0395. For \u03a1\u0395 is of the same magnitude as \u039c\u039b.

But, because of my alteration, the center of the planetary system is not at V but at S when the planet is seen along CO. Therefore, SO being connected, the earth C will lie outside the line SO, and hence, the planet\u2019s apparent position on the line CO still is intermingled with the second inequality. Nor will CO be farther east at a later time, so as to be at opposition to CS. Instead, it will ascend toward CF, because the sun\u2019s motion, and with it the motion of the center of the planetary system and of all its parts (and thus those of the planet O and of the center of the eccentric L), is from the line CO upward towards F, and is much faster than the motion of the eccentric or planet at O about L from the point H towards the bottom. Consequently, O is appreciably drawn back westward by a motion extraneous, not proper, to the eccentric; and indeed, it is well known that the planets are retrograde at opposition to the sun. Therefore, at a time preceding the moment designated by CV (let it be CT), when the sun appears on  line CQ, the planet will be seen at the point opposite its apparent position, at I. And now, since in the present case it is supposed to have shed the second inequality, QCI will be collinear; that is, the point whence the eccentricity arises will be on the line CQ. But CI, the retrograde planet\u2019s line of vision, earlier in time, is beyond the later (and hence more westerly) line of vision CO. Therefore, CQ will also be beyond CV, and Q will be the system\u2019s new center, beyond the old, V. Moreover, the line IQ was made to be more distant from the line \u039fV to the east by the angle OCI, while the line of apsides VD or PD (from which the motion begins) remains parallel to itself in the entire circuit. As a result, it appears to be established that the planet goes farther in a shorter period of time around the center Q of the system than it previously did in a greater period of time about the center V of the system. ","793":"It thereby becomes apparent what is changed in the apparent eccentric motion by this restoration from the sun\u2019s mean position to its apparent position.

testimony of the ages confirms that the motions of the planets are orbicular.","3":"Reason, having borrowed from experience, immediately presumes this: that their gyrations are perfect circles.","4":"For among figures it is circles, and among bodies the heavens, that are considered the most perfect.","5":"However, when experience seems to teach something different to those who pay careful attention, namely, that the planets deviate from a simple circular path, it gives rise to a powerful sense of wonder, which at length drives people to look into causes.","6":"It is just this from which astronomy arose among humans.","7":"Astronomy's aim is considered to be to show why the stars' motions appear to be irregular on earth, despite their being exceedingly well ordered in heaven, and to investigate the specific circles whereby the stars may be moved, so that by their aid the positions and appearances of those stars at any given time may be predicted.","8":"Before the distinction between the first motion(1) and the second motions(2) was established, people noted (in contemplating the sun, moon and stars) that their diurnal paths were visually very nearly equivalent to circles.","9":"These were, however, entwined one upon another like yarn on a ball, and the circles were for the most part smaller(3) circles of the sphere, rarely the greatest(4) (such","10":"as here ABCE, FMNG cutting the equator AB in CN), part of them north and part south.","11":"They also saw that the stars have different speeds in this diurnal and apparent motion.","12":"The fixed stars are fastest of all, since those that are in conjunction with any of the planets on the preceding day (such as H with A and F) come to their setting first (such as H, moving along LK back to I).","13":"The sun (on ABE) is slower, as on the following day it stands at E and so its setting follows that of the fixed stars at I with which on the previous day it was conjoined on HA.","14":"Slower still than this, slowest of all the stars, is the moon, since after setting with the sun today (at A, the moon being at F), it lags by an appreciable interval (EG) tomorrow when the sun sets (at E, the whole heaven and the moon along with it having made a circuit around the earth along FMNOG).","15":"Hence the Pythagoreans, when they shared out musical tones among the stars, gave the lowest (the hypate among the strings of the lyre)1 to the moon, because the motions of both were slowest.","16":"Hence have originated the words

G).","18":"The latter term corresponded to a star that is slower in the first motion (such as the moon here), which is, as it were, abandoned and left behind (at G) by the swifter ones (E and I).","19":"For more on this subject see our Optics, Ch.","20":"10.","21":"3","22":"This first adumbration of astronomy consists, not of the unfolding of a cause, but solely of the experience of the eyes, extremely slowly acquired.","23":"It cannot be explained in figures or numbers, nor can it be extrapolated into the future, since it is always different from itself, to the extent that no spiral is equal to any other in increments of time, and none carries over into the next with a curvature of the same quantity.","24":"Nevertheless, there are some people today who, riding roughshod over two thousand years' work, care, erudition, and knowledge, are trying to revive this, obtruding admiration of themselves far and wide (an attempt which has not been fruitless among the ignorant).","25":"Those with more experience consider them with good reason to be incompetent, or (if, like that man Patricius,4 they want to be known as philosophers) to act mad with reasoning.","26":"For it was helpful to astronomers to understand that two simple motions, the first one and the second ones, the common and the proper, are intermingled, and that from this mingling that continuous sequence of conglomerated motions follows.","27":"And so, when that common and extrinsically derived diurnal revolving effect is removed, the fixed stars are suddenly no longer the swiftest and the moon slowest, but quite the opposite, the latter being the swiftest in itself and in its proper motion FG while the former are clearly very slow or immobile.","28":"When a planet (such as the moon at G) is \"left behind\" (by the sun at E or the fixed stars at I), it is carried in consequence*  through FG more swiftly than the sun (through AE) or the fixed stars (through HI).","29":"It, however, it appears to be 'leading' among the fixed stars, it goes along with a retrograde motion.","30":"For example, if the sun at A along with a fixed star at H had been released from the same starting line AH on the previous day, so as to traverse BCDE and arrive at P while the fixed star traversed HLK and arrived at I, the sun, in the space of one day, would have retrogressed through the interval AP.","31":"This turned out to be of great profit in astronomy in grasping the simplicity  of the motions.","32":"Instead of unending spirals, a new one always being added to the end of the earlier one at E or G, there remained little but the solitary circles FG and AE, and a single common motion, either of all the planets and the whole world as well in a direction opposite to the proper motions, or (with the world standing still, according to Aristarchus) of the earth's globe T around the axis QR in the same direction as the proper motions.","33":"Now that the first and diurnal motion had thus been set aside, and only those motions that are apprehended by comparison over a period of days, and that belong to the planets individually, were considered, there appeared in these motions a much more complicated mingling than before, when the diurnal and common motion was still mixed in with them.","34":"For although this residual mingling was there before, it was less observed\u2014less striking to the eyes\u2014because the diurnal motion was very swift.","35":"And so this residual motion was divided into minute parts and spread out over several days and several diurnal spirals.","36":"But now, that minute division and distribution of the star's proper motions over so many days was removed (that is, by the removal of the diurnal motion), and so all the proper motions of the stars, as many as they are, and all the confusion of this multitude shone forth more obviously.","37":"First, it was apparent that the three superior planets, Saturn, Jupiter, and Mars, attune their motions to their proximity to the sun.","38":"For if the sun would approach them they moved forward and were swifter than usual; where the sun would come to the signs opposite the planets they retraced with crablike steps the road they had just covered; between these two times they became stationary; and these things always used to occur, no matter what the signs of the zodiac in which the planets might have been seen.","39":"At the same time, it was clear to the eye that the planets appeared large when retrograde, and small when anticipating the coming of the sun with a direct and swift motion.","40":"From this, the conclusion was easily reached that when the sun approaches they are raised up and recede from the lands, and when the sun departs towards the opposite signs they descend again towards the lands ^5.","41":"And finally, it was observed that these phenomena of retrogressions and increase of luminosity, just described, was moved through the signs of the zodiac in the order that tended from west through the meridian eastward, so that whatever has happened at one time in Pisces soon would come to pass similarly in Aries, then in Taurus, and so on in consequence.","42":"If one were to bundle all this together, and were at the same time to believe that the sun really moves through the zodiac in the space of a year, as Ptolemy and Tycho Brahe believed, he would then have to grant that the circuits of the three superior planets through the aethereal space, composed as they are of several motions, are real spirals, not (as before) in the manner of balled up yarn, with spirals set side by side, but more like the shape of a pretzel,6 as in the following diagram.","43":"This is the accurate depiction of the motions of the star Mars, which it traversed through the aethereal air from the year 1580 until the year 1596, on the assumption that the earth stands still, as Ptolemy and Brahe would have it.","44":"These motions, continued farther, would become unintelligibly intricate, for the continuation is boundless, never returning to its previous path.","45":"Take note, too, that since the orb of Mars requires such a vast space, the spheres of the sun, Venus, Mercury, the moon, fire, air, water, and earth, have to be included in the tiny little circle around the earth A, and in its little area B. In addition, the greatest part even of this little space is given to Venus alone, much greater in proportion than is given to Mars here out of the whole area of the diagram.","46":"Moreover, we are forced to ascribe similar spirals to the remaining four planets, and much more complicated ones to Venus, if the earth stands still.","47":"Ptolemy and Brahe offer explanations of the causes, order, permanence, and regularity of these spirals, the former using individual epicycles carried around on the eccentrics of the individual planets, in imitation of the sun's motion, and the latter by having all the eccentrics carried around upon the single orb of the sun.","48":"Nevertheless, both leave the spirals themselves in the heavens.","49":"Copernicus, by attributing a single annual motion to the earth, entirely rids all the planets of these extremely intricate spirals, leading the individual planets into their respective orbits7 quite bare and very nearly circular.","50":"In the period of time shown in the diagram, Mars traverses one and the same orbit as many times as the 'garlands' you see looped towards the center, with one extra, making, say, nine times, while at the same time the earth repeats its circle sixteen times.","51":"Again, however, it was noticed that these loops in each planet's spirals are unequal in different signs of the zodiac, so that in some places the planet would retrogress through a longer arc of the zodiac, at others through a shorter, and now for a longer, now for a shorter time.","52":"Nor is the increment of brightness of a retrograde planet always the same.","53":"Because, if one were to compute the times and distances between the midpoints of the retrogressions, neither times nor arcs would be equal, nor would any of the times answer to its arc in the same proportion.","54":"Nevertheless, for each planet there was a certain sign of the zodiac from which, through the semicircle to the opposite sign in either direction, all those things successively increased.","55":"From these observations it came to be understood that for any planet there are two inequalities mixed together into one, the first of which completes its cycle with the planet's return to the same sign of the zodiac, the other with the sun's return to the planet.","56":"Now the causes and measures of these inequalities could not be investigated without separating the mixed inequalities and looking into each one by itself.","57":"They therefore thought they should begin with the first inequality, it being more nearly constant and simple, since they saw an example of it in the sun's motion, without the interference of the other inequality.","58":"But in order to separate the second inequality from this first one, they could not do anything but consider the planets on those nights at whose beginning they rise while the sun is setting, which thence were called \u1f00\u03ba\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd\u03c5\u03c7\u03af\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 [acronychal, or  \"night rising\"].","59":"For since the presence and conjunction of the sun makes them go faster than usual, and the opposition of the sun has the opposite effect, before and after these points they are surely much removed from the positions they were going to occupy through the action of the first inequality.","60":"Therefore, at the very moments of conjunction with and opposition to the sun they are traversing those very positions that are their own.","61":"But since they cannot be seen when in conjunction with the sun, only the opposition to the sun remains as suitable for this purpose.","62":"But since the sun's mean and apparent motions*  are two different things, for the sun, too, is subject to the first inequality, the question is raised which of these releases the planets from the second inequality, and whether the planets should be considered when at opposition to the sun's apparent position or its mean position.","63":"Ptolemy chose the mean motion, thinking that the difference (if any) between taking the mean sun and the apparent sun could not be perceived in the observations, but that the form of computation and of the proofs would become free from difficulty if the sun's mean motion were taken.","64":"Copernicus and Tycho followed Ptolemy, carrying over his assumptions.","65":"I, as you see in Ch.","66":"15 of my Mysterium cosmographicum, instead establish the apparent position, the true body of the sun, as my reference point, and will vindicate that position with proofs in Parts 4 and 5 of this work.","67":"But before that, I shall prove in this first part that one who substitutes the sun's apparent for its mean motion establishes a completely different orbit for the planet in the aether, whichever of the more celebrated opinions of the world he follows.","68":"Since this proof depends upon the equivalence of hypotheses, we shall begin with this equivalence.","69":"Chapter 2","70":"On the first and simple equivalence, that of the eccentric and the concentric with an epicycle, and their physical causes.","71":"And now, to begin, I take up the equivalence of hypotheses adopted to save [the appearances of] the first

provided, that is, that the line of apsides in the eccentric and the line through the center of the epicycle and the planet on the concentric always remain parallel, and that the semidiameter of the epicycle in the latter is equal to the eccentricity in the former, while the semidiameters of eccentric and concentric are equal.","74":"And also provided that, in the former, the planet is moved uniformly on its eccentric, so as to traverse equal arcs in equal times.","75":"First, let A be the position of the observer and the center of the concentric BB on which is the epicycle BC, BE.","76":"Let the arcs between two B's, or the angles BAB, be equal, and the planet be first at C, then at E and G, with the lines BE, BG parallel to BC.","77":"Next, let \u03b2 be the center of the

epicycle BC, BE, and parallel to them.","78":"Also, let the arcs \u03b3\u03b5, \u03b3\u03b6, that is, the angles \u03b3\u03b2\u03b5 \u03b3\u03b2\u03b6, be equal both among themselves and to the former angles BAB.","79":"I say that the distances AC, \u03b1\u03b3, are equal, and likewise AE to \u03b1\u03b5, AG to \u03b1\u03b7, AD to \u03b1\u03b4, AH to \u03b1\u03b8, and AF to \u03b1\u03b6; and again, that the angles EAC, \u03b5\u03b1\u03b3 are equal; and that in each instance the planet, although its motion is uniform, will appear from A, \u03b1 slow at C, \u03b3, and swift at D, \u03b4. As I said, Ptolemy demonstrated this in Book III, so there is no need for further discussion.","80":"To geometers, the diagram speaks for itself, and others may go to Ptolemy.","81":"As for the physical accounts of these models, there is a greater difference between the two.","82":"That this may be very clear, it must be researched at somewhat greater depth, in one way from Peurbach2 using Aristotle's principles, and in another way from Tycho.","83":"Ptolemy has described these circles to us in their bare form, such as geometry applied to the observations shows.","84":"Peurbach set up a way for them to be traversed that follows Aristotle, who attempted this same thing upon the geometrical suppositions of Eudoxus and Calippus, by which they had treated their astronomy.","85":"And while these authors used 25 orbs to demonstrate all the inequalities of the planets, Aristotle (since he believed the heavens to be filled with solid orbs)3 thought that 24 other revolving orbs had to be interposed in order to free each lower orb from the revolving effect which, on account of the contiguity of surfaces, it was going to receive from the orb above it.","86":"So, having thus accumulated 49 orbs in all (or 53 or 55, following Calippus), he attributed to each its own mover.","87":"Any one of these would be responsible for the perfectly uniform motion of its own orb and all inferior ones which it encompassed.","88":"This motion would take place inside the closest surrounding superior orb, as if in a sort of place,4 and from the mover would proceed a constant determination [ratio] of both the direction in which the motion was to occur, and the swiftness with which the orb was to return to its starting position.","89":"Moreover, since that philosopher held the motion to be eternal, he also stipulated that the movers  were eternal.","90":"Since they created motion for an infinite time, and since Aristotle knew that nothing material could receive the form of infinity, he maintained that they are also immaterial, and separable principles, and consequently immobile.","91":"Also, since he had constructed the world's eternity from the eternity of motion, and this duration of essence, the goodness and perfection of the whole world, was opposed to destruction, which was bad, he therefore attributed to those principles the highest perfection and the understanding thereof, and from good understanding the will to see it accomplished, lest the good not be done well.","92":"In this way, he introduced to us separate minds which, it turned out, were gods, as the perpetual administrators of the heavens' motions.","93":"They also bestowed a moving soul [anima motrix], more closely attached to the orbs and giving them form, so that the mind would only have to give assistance.","94":"This was either because it seemed necessary that the mover and the moving thing have some common ground, or because the potentiality, considered in relation to the distance to be traversed, should not be infinite, just as there exists no infinite motion, but only motion through a certain space in a certain time.","95":"They therefore transferred this potentiality for creating motion to a soul, for the meantime becoming subject to matter for the purpose of inhering in the orbs of the heavens.","96":"Now this coupling of mind and soul is indeed quite in agreement with the detailed considerations of the astronomers, even though the philosophers' mode of argument is chiefly metaphysical.","97":"For it is the same in humans: the moving faculty is one thing; that which makes use of the moving faculty according to the indications of the senses\u2014the Will\u2014is another.","98":"The senses differ from the moving faculty both in the means they use and in the excellence of their structure, which in the organs of sense is more admirable than in the seats of the motive faculty.","99":"Similarly, if we should propose these Aristotelian orbs as objects of contemplation, two things will present themselves to us: 1) the motive force, sufficient for the round orb, from whose activity and constant strength the time of revolution arises; 2) the direction in which it acts.","100":"The former is more correctly ascribed to the animate faculty, and the latter to its intelligent or remembering nature.","101":"Now although through this solidity of orbs all motions or celestial appearances are so provided for that nothing is left to the providence of the presiding movers, while the whole variety of motions is a consequence of the number and disposition of the orbs; an although nothing else is required but that the moving souls receive and retain their activity and be set going from the first moment of creation in whatever direction is theirs, sent forth from their prisons, as it were, into space;5 nevertheless, it must be kept in mind that there is need of the supreme mind to launch any of the planets in its own direction, as if into its fixed and proper province.","102":"Aristotle, who knew nothing of the world's beginning and did not","103":"believe in it, of necessity ascribed this function instead to the governors of the motions.","104":"The followers of Aristotle, and even Scaliger,6 who professes to be a Christian, openly contend that this motion of the orbs is voluntary, and that the principle of volition for them is intellectual intuition and desire.","105":"So, to return to Peurbach, certain others along with him (chiefly authors of books on the sphere), explain the first model by imagining for themselves one solid concentric orb of the thickness of the whole epicycle, with an epicycle  in it, and in the epicycle a planet.","106":"Then they attributed two moving souls to these two orbs (if they should carry through with their physical considerations), both with the same amount of power, proportionally, so that they would complete their periods in the same time, although moving in opposite directions.","107":"The other model requires two deferents (which remain motionless so long as we abide by the simplicity of the motions, mentally removing the progression of the apogees), and one orb with the thickness of the planetary body.","108":"In this orb is a soul which drives it around with a uniform effort in that direction in which it was projected in the beginning.","109":"Thus, if this solidity of the orbs and the other assumptions be granted, in the first model BC and BE will remain parallel, and in the second, the orb \u03b3\u03b5 will go around the center \u03b2, even though the movers in the former pay no attention to AC, nor in the latter, to \u03b2. For they are governed by material necessity or by the arrangement and contiguity of the orbs.","110":"But, with arguments of the greatest certainty, Tycho Brahe has demolished the solidity of the orbs, which hitherto was able to serve these moving souls, blind as they were, as walking sticks for finding their appointed road; and hence the planets complete their courses in the pure aether, just like birds in the air.","111":"Therefore, we shall have to philosophize differently about: these models.","112":"Let it then be assumed among the first: principles, that every force by which motions of this sort: are administered dwells in the body of the planet itself, and is not: to be sought: outside it","113":"Now the planet: must execute a perfect circle in the pure aether by its inherent: force, an epicycle in the first model and an eccentric in the second.","114":"It is therefore clear that the mover will to have two jobs: first, it must have a faculty strong enough to move its body about, and second, it: must have sufficient knowledge to find a circular boundary in the pure aethereal air, which in itself is not divided into such regions.","115":"This is the function of mind.","116":"Please don't tell me that the motive faculty itself, a scion of a simple and brute soul, has a native altitude for circular motion, exactly like a stone's nature to descend in a straight line.","117":"For I deny that God has created any perpetual non-rectilinear motion that is not ruled by a mind.","118":"Even in the human body, all the muscles move according to tire principles of rectilinear motions.","119":"They either swell by contacting info themselves, or stretch out, the ends moving apart: in the former case, the member approaches the muscle, while in the latter, the member recedes.","120":"This same thing takes place in its own way in the circular muscles  that are set up as guards for orifices.","121":"When they are extended by the circular filaments, they relax and open the passage, and constrict it when the filaments return into the form of a smaller circle.","122":"There is no member whatever that rotates uniformly and without impediment.","123":"On the contrary, the bending of the head, feet, arms, and tongue is expressed in certain mechanical devices by many straight muscles carried across or stretched out from one place to another.","124":"In this way it is brought about that the motive faculty, which by its own nature tends in a straight line, swings its member in a gyre.","125":"Likewise, certain machines raise water to great heights, not because the nature of the body, which conveys the motion, tends to an exalted position, but because, by an arrangement of channels, it is brought about that the water necessarily gives way upwards when a greater weight tends downwards.","126":"And even if the motion of certain members were perfectly circular, they7 nonetheless could not be perpetual.","127":"There should be no great wonder at this, since in the human body mind presides over the animate faculty.","128":"Surely, then, if there had been any way of so constructing some moving faculty that it might be able to rotate some body, it would not have been neglected in the human body.","129":"Besides, it is quite impossible for any mind to manifest a circular path without recourse to the guidepost either of a center or of some body which might appear under a greater or smaller angle according to its approach or recession.","130":"For a circle is both defined and brought to perfection by the same criterion, namely, equality of distance from the middle.","131":"No matter how many of these motive faculties you set up, a circle, even for God, is nothing other than what was just said.","132":"Geometers do, of course, show how, given three points on a circumference, to form a continuous circle, but in this very proof it is presupposed that some portion of the circumference (that which passes through the three points) is already constructed.","133":"Who, then, will show the planet this starting place, in conformity with which it will make the rest of its path?","134":"This is possible in no other way than if the planet's mover (as in Avicenna's opinion) imagine for itself the center of its orb and its distance from it, or if it be assisted by providing some other property of a circle in order to lay out its own circle.","135":"We will therefore now form the phys","136":"ical hypothesis of these two models in another way In the latter, simpler one, if our supposition is valid that the mover driving the planet around the path \u03b3\u03b5\u03b4 is in the planet itself, there will have to accrue to the planet's mover some sort of awareness of the apparent magnitude of the body at \u03b1 seen (or as if seen) from \u03b3, \u03b5, \u03b7, \u03b4. The planet will therefore have to strive both to move forward uniformly (this the undivided","137":"and unimpeded forces of the moving soul provide), and to exhibit all the distances \u03b1\u03b3, \u03b1\u03b5, \u03b1\u03b7, \u03b1\u03b4, in such order that they follow by a geometrical law from the eccentric \u03b2\u03b3.","138":"To this end, the mover should also know how much longer \u03b1\u03b3 is than \u03b1\u03b4; that is, by how much the path which it will traverse is eccentric from the body at \u03b1 around which it is to go.","139":"The planet's mover will thus be occupied with many things at once.","140":"To escape this conclusion, one must assert that the planet pays attention to the point \u03b2, entirely empty of any body or","141":"real quality, and maintains equal distances from that point.","142":"The prior model is explained physically thus.","143":"Let a motive power be","144":"conceived which, seated on the concentric B and itself without body, moves around the body at A with a uniform exertion of forces, maintaining equal distances from that point.","145":"Let there be another power in the body of the planet C, capable of holding its attention on the incorporeal power at B, estimating and maintaining its distance from that power, and moving uniformly around it.","146":"Thus, as before, this power again will have numerous tasks.","147":"But it is also incredible in itself that an immaterial power reside in a non-body, be moved in space and time, but not have a substrate to move itself (as I said) from place to place.","148":"And I am making these absurd assumptions in order to establish in the end the impossibility that every cause of a planet's motions inhere in its body or somewhere else in its orb, and to build a path for other less difficult forms of motions that are more readily persuasive.","149":"I have presented these models hypothetically, the hypothesis being astronomy's testimony that the planet's path is a perfect eccentric circle such as was described.","150":"If astronomy will discover something different, the physical theories will also change.","151":"In this equivalence of hypotheses, not only the equality of the apparent angles at A and \u03b1, but also the actual paths themselves of the planets through the surrounding aether, each remain the same.","152":"For in both shape and size, the planet traverses an arc from C to E through angle CAE that is also the same as it traverses from \u03b3 to \u03b5 through the equal angle \u03b3\u03b1\u03b5.","153":".","154":"CHAPTER 3","155":"On the equivalence and unanimity of different points of observation and of hypotheses, for laying out one and the same planetary path.","156":"Next, I must show how one and the same planetary motion, while in itself remaining the same, can display one or another appearance, and how the pair of forms are equivalent here.","157":"About centers A and \u03b3, with equal radii AC, \u03b3\u03b5, let the circles CD, \u03b5\u03b6 be described with CA, \u03b5\u03b3 drawn through the centers parallel to one another, and other lines AB, \u03b3\u03b4, and AD, \u03b3\u03b6, through the centers inclined to the former, both pairs likewise parallel.","158":"Also, about B let an epicycle be described, with radius BE, and likewise  about D with radius DG equal to BE.","159":"Let the planet be placed at E and G, so that DG and AB are parallel.","160":"On the line \u03b4\u03b3 let a segment equal to BE be set out on the side opposite \u03b4, and let it be \u03b3\u03b2.","161":"Let G be joined with A and \u03b6 with \u03b2.

Let I and H be joined with A, and also \u03b4 and \u03b6 with \u03b1. Again, therefore, the hypotheses will be equivalent by the preceding chapter, and to an observer placed at A and \u03b1, FAH and \u03b5\u03b1\u03b6 will be equal, as well as FAI and \u03b5\u03b1\u03b4.","170":"FA and \u03b5\u03b1 will also be equal, as well as HA and \u03b6\u03b1, and IA and \u03b4\u03b1.","171":"And finally, the arcs FH and \u03b5\u03b6 will be equal and similar, as are also FI and \u03b5\u03b4, by construction.","172":"Therefore, if the path of the planet remain the same while the observer is moved from \u03b2 to \u03b1, different appearances will be produced at the same moments of time.","173":"For the same places, \u03b4 and \u03b6, are viewed in different ways from \u03b2 and \u03b1. On the other hand, if the observer remain at A, and the quantity of the planet's path EG, IH remain the same while changing its place, the planet will again appear in different places, even when at the same place on its path, because the entire path has been shifted.","174":"Accordingly, since the planet, whether viewed from \u03b1 or \u03b2, is at \u03b4, or at \u03b6, at the same moment in each observation, and the hypotheses are entirely equivalent, it must also be said that I and E, which are positions of different epicycles, are occupied by the planet at the same moment.","175":"The same is true of G and H. The only difference is that in the first diagram the planet's path is shifted by altering the epicycle in its position, the observer remaining in the same place, while in the second diagram, for the planet's path the position also stays the same while the observer's position is changed by the same amount in the opposite direction.","176":"If required, however, it is possible to keep the path fixed in the former and the observer fixed in the latter fixed by shifting what is now fixed, in accordance with the","177":"demonstrations of the preceding chapter.","178":"This demonstration will be put to use below.","179":"For surely, if the first inequality of the superior planets could be accounted for by the simple hypothesis of the second chapter, no difficulty would arise as to whether one should examine the first inequality at mean opposition to the sun, or at apparent opposition.","180":"For the actual path would in fact remain the same, and in both models the planet would be at the same points of the path at any given moment.","181":"Only the position of this path, in the first model, would be altered through the space of the sun's eccentricity, while in the second, although the path would stay fixed, the point whence the eccentricity is reckoned would also be shifted by the same amount.","182":"In the physical account, the above characteristics remain unchanged.","183":"Only their quantities change as the motive powers are intensified.","184":"CHAPTER 4","185":"On the imperfect equivalence between a double epicycle on a concentric, or eccentric-epicycle, and equant on an eccentric.","186":"That is how it would be if there were scope for the simple hypothesis of ch.","187":"3 to account for the first inequality of the superior planets.","188":"However, for demonstrating the first and simple inequality of the planets, Ptolemy makes use of a more elaborate hypothesis.","189":"About center B let an eccentric DE be described, with eccentricity BA, so that A is the place of the observer.","190":"The line drawn through AB will indicate the apogee at D and the perigee at F. Upon this line, above B, let another segment BC be extended, equal to BA.","191":"C will be the point of the equant, that is, the point about which the planet completes equal angles in equal times, even though it lays out the circle around B rather than around C.","192":"In Book V ch.","193":"4, as well as Book IV ch.","194":"71,","195":"Copernicus marks this hypothesis among other things in this respect, that it offends against physical principles by instituting irregular celestial motions.","196":"For let a point E be chosen on the circle which the planet is bodily traversing, and let it be connected with C, B, and A. Now let DCE be a right angle, as well as ECF.","197":"Now since these angles are equal (for they are set up in equal times), and the exterior angle DCE is equal to the interior angles CBE and CEB, therefore, when the part CEB is subtracted, the remainder CBE or DBE will be less than DCE.","198":"Consequently, FBE will be greater than DCE or FCE.","199":"But the arc DE measures the angle DBE, and the arc EF measures the angle EBF.","200":"Therefore, DE is smaller than EF, and the planet passes over them in equal times.","201":"Therefore, the same solid orb (Copernicus believed in them)2 in which the planet inheres is slow when the planet borne by the orb proceeds from D to E, and fast when the planet goes from E to F. Therefore, the  entire solid orb is now fast, now slow.","202":"This Copernicus rejects as absurd.","203":"Now I, too, for good reasons, would reject as absurd the notion that the moving power should preside over a solid orb, everywhere uniform, rather than over the bare planet.","204":"But because there are no solid orbs, consider now the physical coherence of this hypothesis when very slight changes are made, as described below.","205":"This hypothesis, it should be added, posits two motive powers to move the planet (Ptolemy was unaware of this).","206":"It places one of these in the body A (which, in the reformed astronomy will be the very sun itself), and says that this power endeavors to drive the planet around itself, but possesses an infinite number of degrees corresponding to the infinite number of points of the distance from A. Thus, just as AD is the longest, and AF the shortest, so the planet is slowest at D and fastest at F, and in general, as AD is to AE, so is the slowness at D to the slowness at E3, as will be demonstrated at great length in Part III below.","207":"The hypothesis attributes another motive power to the planet itself, which has the capacity to adjust its approach to and recession from the sun, either by the strength of the angles or by inspection of the increase or decrease of the solar diameter, and to make the difference between the mean distance and the longest and shortest equal to AB.","208":"Therefore, the point of the equant C is nothing but a geometrical short cut for computing the equations from a hypothesis that is clearly physical.","209":"But if the planet's path is a perfect circle, as Ptolemy certainly thought, the planet also has to have some additional perception of the swiftness and slowness by which it is carried along by the other external power, in order to adjust its own approach and recession in such accord with the power's precepts that the path DE itself is made to be a circle.","210":"It therefore needs both a comprehension of the circle and a desire to effect it.","211":"Also, the ratios of its own slowness and swiftness must differ from the gradations of the external power.","212":"However, if the demonstrations of astronomy, founded upon observations, should testify that the path of the planet is not quite circular, contrary to what this hypothesis asserts, then this physical account too will be constructed differently and the planet's power will be freed from these rather troublesome requirements.","213":"But let me return to Copernicus.","214":"In avoiding the absurdity explained just above from his own opinions, he substituted another epicycle for the equant, in the following way.","215":"About center \u03b1 with radius \u03b1\u03b2 equal to BD let the concentric \u03b2\u03b4 be described, so that the observer is at \u03b1; let \u03b1\u03b2, parallel to BD, be extended in both directions; and let the angle \u03b2\u03b1\u03b4 be set up equal to DCE.","216":"Now let BC be bisected at I, and about the centers \u03b2 and \u03b4 with radii \u03b2\u03b3 and \u03b4\u03b6 equal to AI let the first or greater epicycle be described, and let \u03b4\u03b6 be parallel to \u03b1\u03b2.","217":"Next, about centers \u03b3 and \u03b6, but with radii \u03b3\u03b5, \u03b6\u03b7 equal to IC, let the second epicycle be described, and let its motion be eastward, with twice the speed of the motion of the first.","218":"And let the westward motion of the first epicycle be equal to the motion of the eccentric.","219":"And since \u03b3 is on \u03b1\u03b2, let the planet be at \u03b5, the point nearest \u03b2. And since \u03b2\u03b1\u03b4 is  right, let the planet be at \u03b7, the point farthest from the center of the greater epicycle \u03b4. This particular hypothesis of Copernicus is also followed by Tycho Brahe religiously, in all particulars.","220":"Physically considered, this hypothesis is in any event valid if you grant solid orbs.","221":"However, if you remove these, as Brahe does with good reason, it says something practically impossible.","222":"For it attaches three movement- producing minds to a single planet; and besides, the other two [minds] will be thrown into confusion by the motion and impulse of one of them towards the body at \u03b1. For that any of them should pay heed to its own center, which is not distinguished by any body and is mobile besides, cannot be represented even in thought.","223":"Further, while Copernicus strives to outdo Ptolemy in the uniformity of motions, he is in turn outdone by him in the perfection of the planetary path.","224":"For, in Ptolemy, the planet bodily traces out a perfect circle in the aethereal air.","225":"Copernicus, on the other hand, says in Book V ch.","226":"4 that for him the path of a planet is not circular, but goes outside the circular path at the sides.","227":"This is easily demonstrated in the present diagram.","228":"If from \u03b5, the planet's position at apogee, you extend the distance \u03b1\u03b2, the semidiameter of the orb, to \u03b8, and from \u03b8 draw \u03b8\u03ba parallel to \u03b1\u03b4, the circle \u03b5\u03ba described about \u03b8 will indeed go through \u03b5 and the perigeal point opposite, but since it touches the straight line \u03b4\u03b7 only at k, while the planet goes through \u03b7, it does not stay on the circle \u03b5\u03ba, but strays outside this track.","229":"To this excursion of the planetary path from the perfection of the circle Ptolemy might well have objected against Copernicus, but I do not.","230":"For below, in Part IV, it will be demonstrated that by the agency of two physical powers, simple in capability, acting in concert to move the planet, it necessarily happens that the planet turns aside from the circle for a short time, though not by running outside of it, as in this Copernican hypothesis, but in the opposite direction, towards the center; that is, by making an incursion.","231":"Besides, should Copernicus retain that liberty he had of setting up the ratios of the epicycles, it can happen that the planet's path would come out twisted, higher before and after apogee than at apogee itself, and lower before and after perigee than at perigee itself.","232":"This happened to Tycho in his lunar theory, inasmuch as he followed Copernicus.","233":"That these two forms of hypothesis are not simply equivalent, I shall demonstrate numerically.","234":"In the Ptolemaic form it can be computed more simply than Ptolemy did in the following manner.","235":"First, in triangle CBE, given the mean anomaly ECB or DCE, the side CB \u2014 the eccentricity of the equant\u2014is also given, as well as the radius of the orb, BE.","236":"Therefore, as the radius of the orb is to the sine of ECB, so is CB to the sine of CEB.","237":"And since ECD is equal to the two opposite interior angles CEB and CBE taken together, therefore CEB subtracted from DCE leaves CBE.","238":"Therefore, in  triangle EBA, the angle at B is given, together with the sides about it.","239":"For BA is the eccentricity of the eccentric, while EB is the radius of the orb.","240":"Therefore, following the rule for this form of triangle, the angle BEA is given.","241":"But CEB was given before.","242":"Therefore, the whole equation CEA will be given.","243":"We shall now make use of numbers belonging to the motion of Mars.","244":"Although Ptolemy made CB and BA equal, Copernicus, freed from this rule, nonetheless also adopted other ratios, which Tycho Brahe undertook to imitate.","245":"Let CB be 7560, BA 12,600, where BE is 100,000; and, first, let DCE be 45\u00b0, whose sine is 70,711.","246":"Therefore, as 100,000 is to 70,711, so is 7560 to 5346, the sine of the arc of 3\u00b0 4' 52\", which is CEB.","247":"Subtracting this from 45\u00b0 leaves CBE, 41\u00b0 55' 8\", whose half is 20\u00b0 57' 34\", the tangent to which arc is 38,304.","248":"And since EB is 100,000, while BA is 12,600, the difference, 87,400, multiplied by the radius and divided by the sum, 112,600, gives 77,620.","249":"Multiply this by the tangent found above (38,304).","250":"The product, that is, 29,732, is the tangent of the arc 16\u00b0 33' 30\", which, subtracted from the half of CBE, found above, leaves 4\u00b0 24' 4\", which is the angle BEA.","251":"Therefore, the whole, CEA, is 7\u00b0 28' 56\", in the Ptolemaic form.","252":"In the Copernican form, although the ordinary means of finding the equation is clearly presented in Tycho's lunar tables in Vol.","253":"I of the Progymnasmata, and in Copernicus himself, let me nonetheless follow a different, less usual procedure, which is adapted to an anomaly of 45\u00b0.","254":"Let \u03b2\u03b1\u03bb be 45\u00b0, and \u03bb\u03bd or \u03b2\u03b3 be 16,380, \u03b3\u03b5 or \u03bd\u03bf be 3780, and \u03bf\u03bd\u03bb be right, that is, twice \u03b2\u03b1\u03bb.","255":"Now let \u03bd\u03bb be parallel to \u03b2\u03b1, and let \u03bd\u03bb and \u03b4\u03b1 be extended, so as to meet at \u03bc.

And let \u03b3\u03b1 be the magnitude of the eccentricity, or the radius of the greater Copernican epicycle (the equivalence of the two was discussed at the end of Ch.","287":"4, preceding).","288":"Next, about center \u03b5, with radius \u03b5\u03b7, let the smaller epicycle be described, and since its center is at \u03b5, let the planet be at \u03b7, falling on the line \u03b5\u03b3, so that it is not the star but the center of the epicycle bearing the star that runs along the eccentric \u03b5\u03b4.","289":"Thus, by Ch.","290":"4, it is the Copernican form that is expressed here.","291":"By Ch.","292":"3, we shall set up another that is equivalent to it in reality or in the indication of the exact planetary path, but is different in appearance.","293":"This","294":"we shall do by moving the observer from \u03b1. By what was said at the end of Ch.","295":"3, we could do the same thing even if the observer were to remain at \u03b1, by moving the eccentric while keeping lines parallel, in such a way that the size of the eccentric remains constant and only its position changes.","296":"But we shall carry it to completion as we have begun it.","297":"Adopting a position for the observer not on the prior line of apsides (let it be \u03b2), such that \u03b2\u03b3 has a magnitude different from that of \u03b1\u03b3 (that is, a new eccentricity or new radius of the greater epicycle), let us draw a new line of apsides \u03b2\u03b4 through \u03b2\u03b3, and at \u03b4 let us describe an epicycle equal to the former.","298":"Here, although the center of the epicycle is at the apsis \u03b4, nonetheless we shall not place the planet at the point nearest \u03b3, as before, but, taking the measure of the angle \u03b5\u03b3\u03b4, we shall set out the angle \u03b8\u03b4\u03b3 twice that size, in the direction of \u03b5, and shall place the planet at \u03b8, when the epicycle is at the apsis \u03b4. For this is where the planet would be, were the observer at \u03b1 and the epicycle at \u03b4. In this way, the true compound planetary path remains the same to a hair\u2019s breadth, while the appearance is altered.","299":"For when the lines of sight are inclined to one another, as \u03b2\u03b8 and \u03b1\u03b8 here, or \u03b2\u03b7 and \u03b1\u03b7, they fall upon different positions beneath the fixed stars.","300":"You may object that even when the lines of sight are parallel, they fall upon different positions beneath the fixed stars, and it is therefore not essential that they be inclined to one another.","301":"I answer, this is indeed true, but in that case the space of the sphere of the stars intercepted between the two lines is not perceptible to the power of sight unless the distance between the parallels is perceptible in relation to the radius of the sphere of the stars.","302":"In the physical account, this must be posited in addition to what was said in Ch.","303":"3, in order to establish the identity of the path while the appearances are altered: the mind to which the smaller epicycle is committed pays attention to a point on the circuit different from the one regarded by the mind of the greater epicycle.","304":"For in the second position, the greater epicycle or the eccentricity returns to its starting point on the line \u03b2\u03b4, while the smaller epicycle does so on the line \u03b1\u03b5 which does not pass through the place of the observer.","305":"This is because, in the second position, the observer is located at \u03b2, while in the first position, where the observer is located at \u03b1, both epicycles return to their starting points on the same line \u03b5\u03b1.","306":"The form of the hypothesis thus does not  remain simply the same physically in such a way that that the planet keeps the same path.","307":"But suppose you were going to simulate the same path in the second position by having both epicycles return to their starting point at the same line of apsides \u03b2\u03b4.","308":"If so, while the eccentric as well as the epicycle stay the same in both instances, the position of the planet on the epicycle will be different at every single moment.","309":"Thus, although in the second instance the form of Ptolemaic hypothesis presented is the same to a hair\u2019s breadth, the actual path of the planet will be altered.","310":"Hence, it will be inferred below, even though the first inequality of the planets may be entirely accounted for by the compound hypothesis of Ch.","311":"4, it cannot happen that the first inequality have the same measure at the planet\u2019s mean opposition to the sun as at apparent opposition, unless the planet\u2019s orbit be moved from its own location at the same time (unlike the circles in the theory of the sun), or the Ptolemaic form of Ch.","312":"4 be changed.","313":"Maestlin made use of this form of transposition in constructing the table in Ch.","314":"15 of my Mysterium cosmographicum.","315":"For when Copernicus transformed the Ptolemaic [models] into his own general form of hypotheses, he supposed the observer to be stationed at some nearly motionless point near the sun, distant from the sun\u2019s own body by the entire eccentricity of the solar orb.","316":"I, however, in adapting Copernicus to the subject matter of that book, needed a different fiction.","317":"The observer was to be imagined as transported from that point to the very center of the solar body, and from there (that is, from the body of the sun) the departures of the planetary bodies were to be computed, moving on the same path which the suppositions of Copernicus fashioned.","318":"But, as has just now been shown, by reason of the particular times my translation of the line of apsides did not effect exactly the same path.","319":"The difference, however, was very slight, and was clearly of no importance in that little book.","320":"For there the question concerned only the location of the path, which this procedure did not affect.","321":"As for the rest, in order to avoid confusion in what follows, I shall no longer make use of this Copernican eccentric, described by the center of the epicycle rather than the star.","322":"It differs from the planet's true path, which is higher at perigee and lower at apogee.","323":"The term \"eccentric\"  from now on we will use only to designate the actual path of the planet, or of the point to whose motion the first inequality belongs.","324":"In proceeding in this way, it is appropriate that we imagine only the Ptolemaic eccentric, or something like it.","325":"For it was shown in the fourth chapter that our computation of the equation, based upon the Ptolemaic form, will differ from the Copernican by only two minutes at most.","326":"Then, too, the procedure for computing the first inequality is easier in the Ptolemaic form than in the Copernican.","327":"Finally, as was said, this Ptolemaic form of the first inequality is better accommodated to nature herself and to our speculations that follow in the third and fourth parts.","328":"However, because of the equivalence, anyone who so chooses will always be able to supply in thought  the Copernican eccentric-cum-epicycle considered so far in this fifth chapter.","329":"I now proceed to the prior procedure for setting up the two sorts of equivalence that I have proposed\u2014the one common to the particular hypotheses of the authorities.","330":"I shall demonstrate this first in the Ptolemaic form.","331":"About center \u03b2 let the Ptolemaic eccentric \u03b9\u03b6\u03b7 be described, with \u03b9\u03b2 the line of apsides, \u03b1 the observer, and \u03b3 the equalizing point ^1.","332":"Now when I say that the observer is at \u03b1, I mean it either as a fiction or as truth.","333":"Physically speaking, it is not so much the observer which is to be placed at \u03b1 as the power which renders the planetary circuit around itself slow or swift according to the ratios of its proximity to \u03b1, as was said above.","334":"Let some point on the circumference not on the line of apsides (say, \u03b7) be connected with \u03b3, \u03b2, and \u03b1. Let it be that about as many angles \u03b9\u03b1\u03b7 may be computed by this hypothesis throughout the entire circuit as are observed from \u03b1, and after certain periods of time, which the angle \u03b7\u03b3\u03b9 measures uniformly.","335":"Later, in the second part, it will be shown how one can find, through astronomical observations, how great the angle \u03b7\u03b1\u03b9 should be for any given \u03b7\u03b3\u03b9.","336":"Again, let the observer or moving power be at some point not on the line \u03b9\u03b1, and let this be \u03b4. Also, let it be granted us that the apparent angles about \u03b4 be apprehended by astronomical observations at certain times; that is, how much the planet appears to move forward in sidereal position in a given time when seen from \u03b4. Let this be granted as well: that these appearances at \u03b4 square with a hypothesis in conformity with the previous one, with only the magnitude of the eccentricity altered.","337":"But since it is certain that at one and the same time the planet traverses one and the same path in the heavens, not one seen to an observer at \u03b4 and another to an observer at \u03b1, it is also certain, as a consequence, that the planet cannot appear to both observers (both the one at \u03b1 and the one at \u03b4) to be equally moved in the same time.","338":"For let \u03b9\u03b7 be a portion of the planet\u2019s true path, and let the planet traverse this in a given time, say twenty days.","339":"Now since \u03b1 is nearer \u03b9\u03b7 than \u03b4 is, \u03b9\u03b7 will appear greater at \u03b1 than at \u03b4, by what is demonstrated in optics.","340":"Therefore, during the same twenty days the planet will appear to make greater progress to one who is at \u03b1 than to one who is at \u03b4. And since any planet maintains a fixed and constant number of days in which it is returned to the same sidereal position, the slowness has to be compensated by a contrary speed.","341":"Therefore, since in the portion \u03b9\u03b7 the planet appears slower to one at \u03b4, it will in some other portion appear swifter to the one at \u03b4 than to one at \u03b1. Hence it happens that it appears slowest to the one at \u03b4 in one place, and to one at \u03b1 in another.","342":"Nevertheless,  the planet itself can be truly slowest in but one place on its orbit.","343":"With these as preliminaries, the question is raised whether one and the same true path of the planet in the heavens (this is presupposed) can present two sets of appearances each proper to an observer, one at \u03b4 and the other at \u03b1, and each such as comply with and admit the Ptolemaic form of computation.","344":"If the planet were of equal speed at all parts of its orbit, the answer, according to what was said in Ch.","345":"3, is yes.","346":"But since in terms of real and true increment of time2 the planet is slowest at one point on the eccentric and fastest at the opposite point, the answer must therefore be, clearly not.","347":"The reason for this is that the two slowings are intermingled, one real and physical, occurring at one place on the eccentric, and the other optical and apparent and not occurring at a single place, but in the place most distant from whatever position is chosen for the observer.","348":"Now, when the observer \u03b1 lies upon a line drawn through the center of the eccentric \u03b2 and the center of the equant \u03b3 on the side of \u03b2 opposite the center of the equant \u03b3, then both slowings verge toward the same sidereal position \u03b9. But when the observer departs from this line, as at \u03b4, then a straight line drawn from \u03b4 through the center of the circle \u03b2 marks the place of the optical slowing, \u03b7, while the true and physical slowing is at \u03b9. Furthermore, each of these inequalities or slowings diminishes the other, and they are accumulated at an intermediate point between \u03b9 and \u03b7, as would be if a line were to be drawn from \u03b4 through \u03b3 to the point \u03b6. Consequently, were one to adopt a form of computation in which \u03b4\u03b2 were the line of apsides of the eccentric and \u03b2\u03b3 the line of the equant\u2019s eccentricity, then even though the planet\u2019s true path \u03b9\u03b7 remained the same, it would be represented differently at \u03b4 than at \u03b1. For to the observer at \u03b4 the planet would be slowest at \u03b6, and to the one at \u03b1 it would be slowest at \u03b9. But no such thing would be represented at \u03b4 that ought to have been represented by a hypothesis of the same form as the previous one, according to our presuppositions above.","349":"For the forms of the hypotheses differ in that in the former, \u03b2 is the midpoint between \u03b1 and \u03b3 (as physical considerations require, if the moving power is in \u03b1), while in the latter the center of the eccentric \u03b2 would not be the midpoint between \u03b4 and \u03b3, nor would the line of the equant\u2019s eccentricity pass through the observer \u03b4, as before.","350":"Even if it did pass through \u03b4, as \u03b4\u03b3, it would not cut the eccentric into two equal parts, because it would not cut it at the center \u03b2, and it would not allow the planet to appear on one side fastest and on the other slowest, at opposite places.","351":"It is thus established that when a planet's path in the heavens remains in all respects unchanged, the form of hypothesis cannot persist entirely unchanged.","352":"This raises the further question, how much the path of a planet is changed from its prior position if the same form of hypothesis is set up about \u03b4, and how much this newly established hypothesis at \u03b4 will be at variance with the appearances as seen at \u03b1. First, if the center of the equant be transferred from \u03b3 to the line \u03b4\u03b2, and \u03b2\u03bc be made equal to \u03b2\u03b3, the position of the planetary path is quite unchanged, but the planet is slowest, in physical terms, at \u03b7 rather than \u03b9. This  changes what cannot be changed in the planet\u2019s path, because, unlike the optical slowing, the physical slowing is independent of the observer\u2019s viewpoint.","353":"Even though the planet would traverse the same path \u03b9\u03b7 in twenty days (which path appears greater at \u03b1 and smaller at \u03b4), nevertheless, if you consider the parts of this time, their ratio in comparison with the parts of this path will be violently perturbed, and much more so at other places, not between \u03b9 and \u03b7. In particular, for the observer at \u03b1 the quantity of his equations will be changed noticeably if, for the observer at \u03b4, you will prevent the planet\u2019s being slowest at \u03b9; that is, if you transfer the equant from \u03b3 to \u03bc. For if you draw a straight line through \u03b3\u03bc to the point \u03bd on the circumference and connect \u03b1\u03bd, this equation \u03b1\u03bd\u03bc alone will be equal to the prior, \u03b1\u03bd\u03b3.","354":"Above \u03bd the equations about \u03bc will be smaller, and below \u03bd, greater.","355":"For example, at \u03b7 the angle \u03bc\u03bd\u03b1 is much less than \u03b3\u03b7\u03b1.","356":"But then what we proposed to do has not been done, for the prior form of hypothesis has not yet been quite established.","357":"For \u03b1\u03b2 is not to \u03b2\u03b3 as \u03b4\u03b2 is to \u03b2\u03bc, since \u03b2\u03bc is equal to \u03b2\u03b3, while \u03b4\u03b2 is greater than \u03b1\u03b2.","358":"But if, on the other hand, you make \u03b4\u03b2 be to \u03b2\u03bc as \u03b1\u03b2 is to \u03b2\u03b3, \u03b2\u03bc will become greater than \u03b2\u03b3.","359":"Whence it follows that for the observer at \u03b1, his equation will be more in error, even when it is at a maximum, on account of the increased eccentricity.","360":"Not only will the planet be slowest in a different place than before, but in also by a different and in fact greater measure of its true slowness.","361":"It is clear, therefore, that the equivalence we have been seeking cannot be established by drawing the line of apsides from \u03b4 through the center of the eccentric \u03b2. And since it has at the same time become clear how important it is to keep the same equant point \u03b3, a breakthrough must in all events be made here, or nowhere.","362":"But what will happen if a new line of apsides be drawn from \u03b4 through the old equant point \u03b3, and a new hypothesis of the same form as the old be set up?","363":"That is, if the center of the eccentric be transferred from \u03b2 to the line \u03b4\u03b3, and \u03b4\u03b8 be made to \u03b8\u03b3 as \u03b1\u03b2 is to \u03b2\u03b3, \u03b8 thus being the center of the eccentric?","364":"Obviously, the result will be this: the path of the planet in the heavens does not remain entirely the same.","365":"About \u03b8 let the eccentric \u03b5\u03ba\u03bb be described, equal to the previous one, and through \u03b8\u03b2 let a straight line be extended to the circumference, on one side to \u03be\u03bf and on the other to \u03c1\u03c0.","366":"Therefore, \u03be\u03bf and \u03c1\u03c0 are both of the same magnitude as \u03b8\u03b2, and the planet is this much closer to \u03b2 at \u03bf, and more remote at \u03c1, than it would have been had it traversed the previous eccentric.","367":"However, the planet is slowest in a different region, for previously the apsis was at \u03b9, and now it is at k. Through this mutual tempering it is brought about that the observer previously stationed at \u03b1 has his observations pretty much unchanged, which is the only thing sought for here.","368":"But now we shall prove it with numbers belonging to Mars\u2019s motion, although Brahe recorded somewhat different ones.","369":"This should prove no impediment to us, since we are only performing a preliminary exercise3 here.","370":"Let the magnitudes on the line \u03b4\u03b3\u03b1 be taken as follows: let \u03b4\u03b1 be the quantity of the sun\u2019s eccentricity, 3584; \u03b4\u03b3 the eccentricity of Mars, 30,138 of the same parts, and the angle \u03b1\u03b4\u03b3 47\u00b0 59\u00bc\u2019, which is the angular difference between the sun\u2019s and Mars\u2019s apogees.","371":"Now, from these three given quantities, \u03b3\u03b1, Mars\u2019s new eccentricity, will also be given, and will be 27,971, while the angle \u03b4\u03b3\u03b1 is 5\u00b0 27\u2019 47\u201d.","372":"On the supposition that the old apogee of Mars \u03b4\u03b3 is positioned at 23\u00b0 32' 16\" Leo, Mars\u2019s new apogee \u03b1\u03b3 will fall at 29\u00b0 0\u2019 16\u201d Leo.","373":"Now let \u03b2\u03be be 100,000 and \u03b1\u03b3 be 18,034 of the same parts.","374":"Before, it was 27,971, in units of which \u03b4\u03b3 was 30,138.","375":"Therefore, in these units, \u03b4\u03b3 will be 19,763.","376":"Next, let both be divided by the letters \u03b8 and \u03b2 in such a ratio that \u03b4\u03b8 is to \u03b8\u03b3, and \u03b1\u03b2 to \u03b2\u03b3, as 1260 is to 756: \u03b4\u03b8 will be 12,352, \u03b8\u03b3 7411; and \u03b1\u03b2 11,271, \u03b2\u03b3 6763.","377":"In this way, a Ptolemaic hypothesis for the first inequality may be set up about both \u03b4 and \u03b1.

Jupiter, at trine; Mars, at biquintile or before sequiquadrate, and all at variable distances ^1.","468":"Ptolemy said that at a determined point on the planetary circle that serves for the first inequality, there is fixed, not the planet itself, but the center of an epicycle bearing the planet fixed upon its circumference, which is in turn borne by the planet\u2019s chief circle.","469":"The motion has the following form: if the center of the epicycle be in conjunction with the sun, the planet is also at the highest point of the epicycle and is moved along with the sun in the same direction, [and] when the sun, which is faster, departs from the center of this epicycle, the planet simultaneously descends on the epicycle.","470":"But since the epicycle\u2019s motion about its center is faster than the motion of its center about the earth, it hence happens that when the planet traverses the lower parts of the epicycle while the epicycle\u2019s center is at opposition to the sun, the compounding of motions makes it actually retrograde.","471":"Thus Ptolemy made his opinions correspond to the data and to geometry, and has failed to sustain our admiration.","472":"For we still seek the cause that connects all the epicycles of the planets to the sun, so that they always complete their periods when their centers are in conjunction with the sun.","473":"Copernicus, with the most ancient Pythagoreans and Aristarchus, and I along with them, say that this second inequality does not belong to the planet\u2019s own motion, but only appears to do so, and is really a by-product of the earth\u2019s annual wheeling around the motionless sun.","474":"In this way, just as in Ch.","475":"1 the diurnal motion was separated from the motion proper to the planets, the second inequality of the planets is likewise now separated from the first by Copernicus, and in quite the same way.","476":"For some practitioners admit that the first motion is extrinsic to the planets, but still think it is in fact in the planets, inserted into them, so that the planets, too, are moved with the same motion.","477":"Copernicus holds that it is neither intrinsic to the planets nor inserted, but only attached to them through an optical illusion.","478":"For while the earth rotates upon its axis from west to east, it appears to our eyes that the rest of the world rotates from east to west.","479":"It is, I claim, in just the same way that Copernicus asserts that the planets do not really become stationary and retrograde, but  only appear so.","480":"For he says that since the earth is in addition carried along by another motion, which is annual, in a very large circle (which he calls the orbis magnus), those who believe that the earth is at rest think that the planets and the sun are carried in the opposite direction; and he says that when the sun is between the planet and the earth, in the appearance the motions of the earth and the planet in are added, whence the planet appears to be swift; and when, on the other hand, the earth is between the sun and the planet, the planet is apparently left behind and thus retrogresses, owing to the earth\u2019s being swifter than the planet.","481":"Tycho Brahe holds something in common with the Latins: although the sun does indeed not attract the planets through the aspect, the planets do fawn upon the sun.","482":"For he says that they strive to keep the sun (although it is moving) nearly in the middle of their circuits, and indeed, that they arrange their real paths around the sun as if it were motionless.","483":"Thus any given planet, besides its own path, traverses the sun\u2019s path in the aethereal air, and out of these motions compounded with one another there is produced exactly what Ptolemy had (that is, a spiral), as described in Ch.","484":"1.","485":"In astronomical terms, Ptolemy put epicycles on eccentrics, while Brahe put eccentrics on a single epicycle, which is the sun\u2019s orb itself.","486":"I, in the demonstrations that follow, shall link together all three authors\u2019 forms.","487":"For Tycho, too, whenever I suggested this, answered that he was about to do this on his own initiative even if I had kept silent (and he would have done it had he survived), and on his death bed asked me, whom he knew to be of the Copernican persuasion, that I demonstrate everything in his hypothesis.","488":"Furthermore, we shall demonstrate, both right here and through the entire book (though while doing other things), that these three forms are absolutely, perfectly, geometrically equivalent.","489":"For the present we must carry out what we set out for ourselves and what is to be demonstrated, namely, that there is a very great error indeed in the second inequality if the apparent position of the sun is replaced by its mean position, to which the planet is at opposition at the beginning of this second inequality.","490":"I shall begin with the Copernican opinion ^2.","491":"About center \u03b2 let the earth\u2019s eccentric \u03b3\u03c5 be described, such as Copernicus, putting his trust in Ptolemy, imagined.","492":"Let \u03b3\u03b2 be its line of apsides, \u03ba the position of the motionless sun, and \u03b2 the point about which the earth\u2019s motion is uniform.","493":"Through \u03b2 and perpendicular to \u03b2\u03b3 let \u03c5\u03b2\u03c3 be drawn, intersecting the circumference at points \u03c5 and \u03c3, and let \u03c5 and \u03c3 be joined to \u03ba.","494":"Copernicus, intending to transfer the Ptolemaic numbers into his own form of hypothesis, reckoned the eccentricities of the planets from the conjectural center \u03b2 of the earth\u2019s uniform motion rather than from the sun \u03ba. For if lines be drawn from \u03b2 (as \u03b2\u03b3, \u03b2\u03c5, \u03b2\u03c3), whenever a planet and the earth lie upon one of these, the planet was supposed to shed the second inequality, to which it was subject on account of the earth\u2019s motion, as, for example, if the earth were at \u03c5 and the planet were found on \u03b2\u03c5 extended.","495":"In effect, by adopting this procedure, Copernicus established a fictitious  observer at the point \u03b2. For provided that the planet is on the line \u03b2\u03c5, it makes no difference for the purpose of designating its sidereal position whether it be viewed from \u03c3 or from \u03b2. The same may be truly said of the lines \u03b2\u03b3, \u03b2\u03c3, and all the other infinite lines intersecting at \u03b2. Therefore, \u03b2 is the point of intersection of all the lines of vision, and is thus the fictitious common point for all observers.","496":"In fact, however, the point of vision is the earth, our home, which is found at one or another point on the circle \u03c3\u03b3\u03c5 at various times.","497":"So Copernicus believed the planet was freed from the second inequality whenever the planet and the earth were found on any one line passing through \u03b2. Consequently, he endeavored to find the apparent sidereal position of a planet at those moments of opposition to the mean position of the sun through mathematical instruments.","498":"For if the planet\u2019s position was found on one of the nights near the planet\u2019s opposition to the sun, and if at that time the mean position of the sun was found by calculation to be at the point precisely opposite, then that was the moment of time desired.","499":"However, if there was still a little distance between them on that night, then he tracked down this moment of time, and the point or position held by the planet at this moment, by a comparison of two or more nights and of the diurnal motions of Mars and the earth over the interval.","500":"When he had done this as many times and in as many places  on the zodiac as he thought necessary (suppose, for example, \u03b2\u03b3, \u03b2\u03c5, \u03b2\u03c3), the practitioner now began to use these known sidereal or zodiacal positions of the planet, \u03b2\u03b3, \u03b2\u03c5, \u03b2\u03c3, to investigate the hypothesis of the first inequality.","501":"This involved finding the magnitude of the planetary circle's eccentricity from the selected point \u03b2, and the parts of the zodiac into which the apogee points, by comparing the angles which the observed positions set up about the point of observation \u03b2, with the time intervals between them.","502":"The method of this undertaking, however, I shall present clearly in its proper place, below.","503":"Suppose these things already done, giving a line of apsides \u03b2\u03b4, eccentricity of the equant point \u03b2\u03b4, and the center of the eccentric on this line at the point \u03bb, and let this hypothesis correspond to all positions observed at the moment of opposition to the sun\u2019s mean position.","504":"Now, Kepler, what more could you ask of Copernicus?","505":"Are you denying that this hypothesis corresponds entirely to observations or to astronomers\u2019 experience?3 That is indeed not in question at present.","506":"Nor was I, when I first entered upon this undertaking, tempted by the observations to take up a different opinion.","507":"But it is this that I have been wanting: Let \u03b2\u03b4 be extended so as to intersect the eccentric at \u03c7 and \u03be, and near \u03c7 let some point \u03c4 on the eccentric be chosen, and lines be drawn from \u03c4 to \u03b4 and \u03bb. Now \u03c7\u03c4 is the measure of the angle \u03c7\u03bb\u03c4, while the angle \u03c7\u03b4\u03c4 is greater than the angle \u03c7\u03bb\u03c4 by the amount \u03b4\u03c4\u03bb, and \u03b4 is the point of temporal uniformity ^4.","508":"Therefore, the time designated by \u03c7\u03b4\u03c4 is greater, with respect to the whole periodic time designated by four right angles, than is the arc  \u03c7\u03c4 with respect to the whole circumference.","509":"The planet, then, is actually slower over the arc \u03c4\u03c7 (this is not just an optical illusion), and fast over the opposite arc; and at \u03c7 it is slowest, and at \u03be it is fastest.","510":"Nevertheless, it is not farthest from the sun \u03ba when it is at \u03c7, nor is it nearest \u03ba at \u03b6. But by all the arguments, even the testimony of the very hypothesis set up upon \u03b2 which I am refuting, it is fitting that this real slowing down of the planet arises from its moving away from the body of the sun, and the speeding up from its approach to the sun itself, seated at \u03ba. On the other hand, it is impossible even to conceive of how a force could inhere in point \u03b2, which has no body, rather than in k, quite nearby, in which there is the sun, the heart of the world, which force would drive the planet around more swiftly or slowly according to its approach and recess.","511":"Furthermore, even if one who is not prepared to admit that the slowings and quickenings arise physically from the close interconnection of the eccentrics, should consequently assert that these affects of motion are naturally under the control of the motive faculties residing in the body of the planet, we will again maintain the same probable conclusion.","512":"For what would be the reason why those","513":"minds would bypass the point \u03ba (which has a geometrical affinity for motion, being invested with a body of no small magnitude) and pay attention to the point \u03b2, only four semidiameters (diameters, according to the authorities)5 of the solar body distant from the sun, empty, and propped up by nothing but imagination alone?","514":"Even Copernicus himself admits, in Book 5 Ch.","515":"16, that the sun is really fixed at \u03ba, wherefore the eccentricity \u03b4\u03ba is constant, while he holds that the point \u03b2, which he takes as the center of the annual orb, is displaced over the ages, thus making \u03b2\u03b4 shorter.","516":"Thus either \u03b2 is no longer in the center of the world today, or it was previously not there.","517":"But it is probable either that the motion originates from the center of the world, or that the moving minds pay attention to the center of the world, and thus not to \u03b2 but to \u03ba, which Copernicus says is fixed, as the center of the world should be.","518":"Led by these probable arguments, I concluded that the line of apsides taken in order to produce the planet\u2019s first inequality, ought to go right through \u03ba itself rather than \u03b2. But we shall obtain this result when we make use of the sidereal positions which the planet has at the moment when the sun\u2019s apparent position and its own are opposite.","519":"And when the points \u03ba and \u03b2 are collinear with the earth \u03b3, and when the planet itself falls on the same line at the same time, as at \u03c4, it is at the same moment at opposition to both the sun\u2019s mean position and its apparent position.","520":"Its position is the same whether it be designated by \u03b2\u03c4 or by \u03ba\u03c4 extended out to the fixed stars, and the planet is truly stripped of its second inequality, whether it depends upon the earth\u2019s apparent position or its mean position.","521":"But when the earth comes to the side of its eccentric, or rather the middle intervals,6 a fairly large difference arises between them.","522":"For let the earth have traveled from \u03b3 to \u03c5 (that is, let the sun, directly opposite, have moved from perigee in Capricorn to Aries), and let the line of the sun\u2019s mean position \u03c5\u03b2 be found in Aries, while the line upon which the planet is observed in Libra be exactly opposite, namely, \u03c5\u03c9.","523":"Now since \u03c5\u03ba is farther eastward beyond \u03c5\u03b2, the sun\u2019s apparent position is beyond opposition to the planet.","524":"And since \u03c5 is the observer\u2019s home, the earth, and \u03c9 is the planet, and both are going down towards \u03be, the earth \u03c5 more swiftly, the line \u03c5\u03c9 will at a later time be still more inclined to the line of the  sun\u2019s visible position \u03c5\u03ba.","525":"Therefore the apparent opposition precedes the mean.","526":"So, at a time preceding the moment designated by \u03b2\u03c5 (call it \u03b2\u03b8), the planet will fall upon a line drawn from \u03ba through \u03b8, that is, at \u03b6. And then the planet\u2019s line of vision \u03b8\u03b6 (as the less experienced should diligently note) lies farther eastward beneath the fixed stars than the line \u03c5\u03c9 of the later time.","527":"This is because, although \u03b8\u03b6 precedes the line \u03c5\u03c9 in being farther west, it is nonetheless exactly as if \u03b8, \u03c5, and absolutely all points on the earth\u2019s circle were a single point and were the center of the sphere of the fixed stars.","528":"Therefore, it is not the distance of the endpoints \u03b8 and \u03c5 but the inclination of the lines \u03b8\u03b6 and \u03c5\u03c9 that causes the lines to strike upon different zodiacal positions, since they would be perceived as coinciding if they were parallel.","529":"But that \u03b6 is inclined towards \u03c9 is clear from the supposition that the planet is moved from \u03b6 to \u03c9 in the same time that the earth is moved from \u03b8 to \u03c5. For the earth is swifter than the planet.","530":"Therefore, the earth traverses a greater space \u03b8\u03c5 than does the planet along \u03b6\u03c9.","531":"But it can be shown even more easily that at an earlier time the planet is farther east, since at opposition it is retrograde, as is clear to everyone.","532":"It is therefore clear what is altered in the positions stripped of the second inequality, in this transition from the mean to the apparent positions of the sun.","533":"For, at \u03c4 and the point opposite, the original positions remain; \u03b1t \u03b6 \u03bfr \u03c9 an addition is made to the observed position, since \u03b8\u03b6 (as was said) is farther eastward than \u03c5\u03c9.","534":"A subtraction is made in the intervening time, because \u03b8\u03b6 is the line of vision at an earlier time than is \u03c5\u03c9.","535":"At the opposite position the outcome is the contrary, that is, an addition is made to the time and a subtraction from the position.","536":"Accordingly, these positions of the planet differ considerably from the original ones.","537":"And therefore, the operation set up in this new way produces quite different results.","538":"That is, since we have transferred the fictitious point of observation to the sun \u03ba (by virtue of our having viewed the planet when it was at \u03c4 and \u03b6 and the earth was on the lines \u03ba\u03c4 and \u03ba\u03b6, namely, at the points \u03b3 and \u03b8), the eccentricity will now originate at the point \u03ba. But in Ch.","539":"5 above, it was shown that when the observer is shifted from \u03b2 to \u03ba and a line is drawn from \u03ba through the original point of uniformity \u03b4, although this new hypothesis does result in a new eccentric, it is one that, for the observer at \u03b2, leaves nearly all his appearances undisturbed.","540":"So, by joining \u03b4\u03ba, dividing it at \u03bc so that \u03b4\u03bb is to \u03b4\u03bc as \u03b4\u03b2 is to \u03b4\u03ba, tracing out a new eccentric \u03b7\u03b5 about \u03bc equal to the previous one \u03be\u03c7, and drawing a new line of apsides through \u03ba\u03b4, a new hypothesis will be formed, whose apsis is at \u03b7. Previously, however, we had improperly called \u03c7 the apogee, because the Copernican center \u03b2 on the line \u03c7\u03b2 was the successor to the Ptolemaic position of the earth.","541":"Now, following my own notions, we shall call \u03b7 the aphelion (since we are in the Copernican hypothesis), and the  point opposite it perihelion, because the sun\u2019s distance from \u03b7 is a maximum ^7.","542":"It has been said how this pair of opinions, mine and those of the authorities, differ as regards physics.","543":"It has also been shown how each is to be constructed geometrically in the Copernican form.","544":"Third, it has been driven home that in astronomical terms those opinions8 do not differ in any important way at the moments of conjunction and opposition9.","545":"The next thing for me to do is to demonstrate what remained unexplained in Ch.","546":"5 above, that there is a considerable difference between the two hypotheses if you are required to use  them to compute the planet\u2019s position outside the acronychal location ^10.","547":"If a line be drawn through the centers of the eccentrics \u03bb, \u03bc, parallel to \u03b2\u03ba, and extended to intersect each eccentric in two points, above and below, there will be set up, below, the maximum space \u03b5\u03c1 between the two, equal to \u03bb\u03bc.","548":"But because it is lines from \u03b4, not those from \u03bb, that designate certain unchanged moments of time, which is what we need here, let \u03b4\u03c1 be drawn intersecting the eccentrics at \u03b5 and \u03c1, so that at one and the same moment the planet on one might be at \u03b5 and on the other at \u03c1. When the earth is on the line \u03b4\u03c1, at \u03c0, the planet, whether it is at \u03b5 or \u03c1, will in either case be seen at the same place on the zodiac.","549":"For, optically considered, the line \u03b5\u03c1 appears as a point.","550":"But when the earth departs towards either side of this line, the magnitude of the line \u03b5\u03c1 appears greater and greater, since it is viewed obliquely.","551":"It is required to find the point on the earth\u2019s orb from which the lines of vision passing through \u03b5 and through \u03c1 are at their greatest distance from one another and form the greatest angle of vision, and at which the error would be greatest if the planet were placed at \u03c1 when it should have been placed at \u03b5.","552":"First, the angle will be greater down at \u03b5 than up near \u03c4 because the earth\u2019s orbit, described about \u03b2, moves the observer nearer to \u03b5\u03c1 than to \u03c4.

\u03c1\u03b5, even though \u03c1\u03b5 is then diminished, its apparent size can increase when viewed from a point beyond \u03bd owing to the greater nearness of the orbs.","640":"This apparent size is now immediately obtained.","641":"For since \u03bf\u03c8 was found to be 25,772, and \u03bf\u03c1 476\u00bd, \u03bf\u03c8\u03b5 will be 1\u00b0 3\u2019 32\u201d But \u03c1\u03bd\u03b5  (which is what we have been seeking) is equal to \u03bf\u03c8\u03b5, by Euclid III.","642":"20.","643":"This is because the whole angle at the center \u03c1\u03c8\u03b5 is twice the angle at the circumference

see how much my transposition of the hypothesis from the mean to the apparent position of the sun creates a disturbance in the annual parallax.","646":"Therefore, by the observations as well, a door has opened for us to determine what I had deduced a priori by consideration of moving causes: that the planet\u2019s line of apsides, which is the only line bisecting the planet\u2019s path into two semicircles equal both in size and in vigor\u2014this line, I say, does not (as the practitioners have it) pass through some point other than the sun, but right through the center of the solar body.","647":"In the conclusion of the work I shall demonstrate this by means of observations, in Parts IV and V.","648":"Now, to the extent that this is possible, I shall deduce the same things in the Ptolemaic hypothesis.","649":"About center \u03a8 let the eccentric of the sun \u0393 be described, upon which let \u03a8\u0393 be the line of apsides, with the motionless earth at point \u039a of the line \u03a8\u0393 on the side nearest \u0393, and \u03a8 be the point about which the sun\u2019s motion is reckoned as being uniform.","650":"From \u03a8 and \u039a let the perpendiculars \u03a8\u03a3 and \u039a\u03a5 be set up, and let \u03a3\u039a be joined.","651":"Let \u039a\u03a3 be the line of the sun\u2019s apparent motion, and \u039a\u03a5 the line of the sun\u2019s uniform  motion.","652":"Now Ptolemy measured out the courses of the planets, not on the lines \u039a\u03a3, but on the lines \u039a\u03a5 drawn from \u039a parallel to the lines \u03a8\u03a3 passing through the sun\u2019s body.","653":"For whenever the planet fell upon these lines \u039a\u03a5 on the side opposite the sun, it was supposed to have shed its second inequality, which fell to it (in Ptolemy\u2019s opinion) because of the epicycle.","654":"Then the planet\u2019s sidereal position was sought out by means of instruments, and the center of the epicycle was supposed to be found at that time on the same line.","655":"This was done a number of times and at various places on the zodiac: say, \u039a\u0393, \u039a\u03a5, and the points opposite.","656":"From three such positions of the planet (or of the center of the epicycle, which, according to Ptolemy, accounts for the second inequality), the practitioner sets out to investigate the hypothesis for the first inequality by comparing these angles which the observed positions form about \u039a, the center of the earth and of observation, with the intervening times.","657":"The method for this enterprise is found in Ptolemy Book IX ^19.","658":"Now suppose the treatment done, and let the eccentric's line of apsides come out to be \u039a\u039b\u0394\u03a7, with \u0394 the equalizing point, the center of the eccentric upon this line and at point \u039b, and the eccentric \u03a7\u0396.","659":"And let this hypothesis correspond to all positions observed at the times of the planet\u2019s opposition to the sun\u2019s mean position.","660":"Here, the objections I raised against Copernicus concerning the ordering of the physical motion are also not clearly in agreement with Ptolemy.","661":"For the center of the epicycle which accounts for the second inequality, here just as the planet itself previously, is borne slowly or swiftly according to its approach  to or recession from the earth \u039a, performed on the circle \u03a7\u0396.","662":"Furthermore, to stipulate that there is in the earth \u039a (just as there was before in Copernicus\u2019s sun, the heart of the world) a motive force that drives the centers of this kind of epicycle around, is absurd and monstrous.","663":"The hypothesis can also be discredited by another physical argument.","664":"For intrinsic to this form of hypothesis, in one way or another, is solidity of the orbs; and since this has been destroyed (by Tycho Brahe\u2019s observations of comets), the hypothesis appears, so to speak, to collapse under its own weight.","665":"For a moving force would be declared to reside in the center of the epicycle (not in a body, but in a mathematical point), and to rouse itself to move from place to place, by an unequal amount in equal times; but at the same time would draw the planet along with itself at the distance of the epicycle\u2019s diameter; all the while causing the planet to gyrate around itself, by equal amounts in equal times.","666":"That this enormous variety cannot fall to a single moving mind (unless it be God), Aristotle gives supporting arguments in the Metaphysics Book XII Ch.","667":"8: he holds that the individual minds preside over individual, perfectly uniform and simple circular motions.","668":"Besides, how will some power sit in a non-body, and flow out of the non-body into the planet?","669":"Even if you divide up the tasks, and locate one motive intelligence at the center of the epicycle and another in the body of the planet, the one at the center will use the earth (a body, of course) as its reference, and will move around the earth nonuniformly in a circle, while the one at a point on the circumference (that is, in the planet's body) will move around an incorporeal center and do so uniformly.","670":"The question, then, is (as before), by what aids would it move around the incorporeal point?","671":"Not by geometrical imagination, for it does not admit of geometrical imagination of itself.","672":"Nor can a mobile point subsist in a non-body even in imagination.","673":"We humans, in imagining points of this sort, have recourse to the aids of tablets or paper, which we draw upon with our hands or at least remember ourselves to have drawn once.","674":"But it likewise cannot happen through a physical flowing of power (which is in the center of the epicycle) out to the circumference and the planet\u2019s body.","675":"For we have submitted to this outflow of power on the supposition that the tasks of the compound motions are divided between two minds.","676":"Why not also question whether in the first, eccentric motion, some natural force constituted to produce motion might subsist in some point entirely devoid of any body?","677":"And even more, whether this kind of incorporeal power can move itself around the earth, and go from place to place?","678":"And most of all, whether it can communicate or transfer another's motion through an efflux from itself, although it is not supported by any body that could serve as its nest?","679":"Those sublime considerations of the essence, motion, place, and operations of the blessed angels and of separate minds which some people will want to raise in opposition to me, are irrelevant.","680":"For we are arguing about natural things which are far inferior in dignity, about powers that exercise no choice of how to vary their action, and about minds which are not in the least separate, since they are yoked and bound to the celestial bodies which they are to bear.","681":"These, then, are the general objections that can be raised against  Ptolemy.","682":"But something further may be said to Ptolemy, on account of which in particular he would wish to abandon his mean position of the sun and embrace the apparent with us.","683":"For if the power moving the planet (whether single or double) acts with respect to the sun, so that it places the planet at the lowest point of the epicycle whenever the center of the epicycle is opposite the sun, I ask (as above) why it looks to the imaginary point \u03a5 (which sometimes precedes and sometimes follows the sun, here marked \u03a3, and is sometimes above and sometimes below it), rather than the sun's body itself?","684":"Or how it is that that power can have any perception whatever of the motion of \u03a5 around the earth K, since there is no body at \u03a8?","685":"Is it not more probable that the epicycle is restored to the lines \u039a\u03a3 of the sun\u2019s apparent position, when these pass through the center of the epicycle?","686":"Let us then see what is changed on the eccentric by substitution of the sun\u2019s apparent position.","687":"Again (as before) when the sun \u0393, the center of the sun\u2019s eccentric \u03a8, and the earth \u039a are on the same line, so that the line of the sun\u2019s apparent position \u03a8\u0393 and the line of its mean position \u039a\u0393 coincide, then for the center of the epicycle \u03a4 this place remains the same, whether its sidereal position is designated by \u039a\u03a4 or by \u03a8\u03a4, and the planet is really on the line \u039a\u03a4 or \u03a8\u03a4 and at the lowest point on its epicycle \u03a6, since here it is nearest to both \u03a8 and \u039a. The planet is thereby truly divested of its second inequality.","688":"But when the sun comes to the side of its eccentric (that is, to the middle distances), a great enough difference arises.","689":"For let the sun have gone from \u0393 to \u03a3, and the line of the sun\u2019s mean position \u039a\u03a5 be found in Aries, and the planet\u2019s line of vision \u039a\u03a9 precisely opposite in Libra, so that \u03a5\u039a\u03a9 is a single line.","690":"Now since  Ptolemy declared that the planet \u03a9 on this line of vision \u039a\u03a9 is divested of its second inequality, he places the center of the epicycle \u0396 on the line \u039a\u03a9.","691":"But since \u039a\u03a3 has gone beyond \u039a\u03a5, the sun\u2019s apparent position is beyond opposition to the planet.","692":"And in the last part of the time, \u039a\u03a9 is not descending, so as to be opposite \u039a\u03a3, but ascends towards \u039a\u03a6, because the lowest parts of the epicycle \u03a9 are retrograde and swifter than the center \u0396, and it is there, of course, that the planet is at opposition to the sun.","693":"Therefore, this apparent opposition precedes the mean one.","694":"Therefore, at some time preceding the moment designated by \u039a\u03a5 (let it be \u039a\u0398) when the sun is seen on the line \u039a\u039e, the planet will be seen opposite it (suppose it to be at \u0399) on \u039a\u0399 which forms a straight line with \u039a\u039e.","695":"Also, because it is now laid down that it sheds the second inequality at this true opposition, the center of the epicycle will also be seen on this line \u039e\u039a, say at \u039f. And because the planet is retrograde, at the time \u039a\u0398 prior to \u039a\u03a5 the planet is on the line \u039a\u0399 later than at \u039a\u03a9.","696":"But \u039a\u0399 and \u039a\u03a9 are parts of the lines \u039a\u039f and \u039a\u0396.","697":"Therefore, \u039a\u039f too is more to the east than \u039a\u0396.","698":"Thus it is clear what would be changed on the line of the epicycle\u2019s center by this restoration from the sun\u2019s mean position to its apparent position.","699":"For at \u03a4 and the opposite point on the original line the motions of the epicycle\u2019s center remain unchanged.","700":"At \u0396 this line, and the center of the epicycle upon it, is moved forward and a subtraction is made from the intervening time.","701":"At the opposite place the contrary happens: an addition is made to the time, and the line of motion of the center of the epicycle is moved back westward.","702":"And thus these lines of the center of the epicycle differ much from the original lines.","703":"For this reason also, when we investigate the causes and measure of the first inequality by a new and repeated operation using these several observed positions of the center of the epicycle (that is, using the observed positions of the planet, after which we suppose the center of the epicycle to lie upon the same line), the outcome of this operation differs much from that of the preceding one.","704":"That is, since the time in the semicircle containing the apogee will have been diminished, so that the planet is correspondingly faster, the eccentricity of the equant will come out smaller.","705":"And since in the greater quadrant \u0392\u0396 of the semicircle containing the apogee the time will have been diminished by an amount equal to the diminution in the other, smaller part, the planet has been made proportionally much faster in the remaining part of the semicircle.","706":"Therefore, the perigee has come closer to the latter, and the apogee has descended from \u03a7 towards \u0396.\nThe quantification of the new hypothesis will be made clear thus.","707":"It is presupposed that the planet \u03a9 falls on the line drawn from the center of the epicycle \u0396 through the earth \u039a, only when \u039a\u0396 is collinear with \u039a\u03a3, the sun\u2019s apparent position.","708":"Therefore, \u039a\u03a3 and the line drawn from \u0396 through the body of the planet always proceed in parallel.","709":"Moreover, we have just taken it from Ptolemy that at the time when the line of the sun\u2019s mean position was \u039a\u03a5, drawn through \u03a9, the planet was observed on the line \u039a\u03a9, and nonetheless we do not grant him that the center of the epicycle \u0396 is on \u039a\u03a9 at the same time.","710":"Therefore, in accord with our position, let a line be drawn from the planet\u2019s position \u03a9 parallel to \u039a\u03a3, and let this be \u03a9\u039f.","711":"We are supposing that the center of the epicycle is at this moment on the line \u03a9\u039f, or some other line nearby and parallel, according as \u03a9 (representing the planet) is closer to or farther from \u039a on the line \u039a\u0396.","712":"Let \u03a9\u039f be drawn from whatever point on the line \u039a\u0396 (now, it is \u03a9), equal to \u03a9\u0396.","713":"From \u039f let a line be drawn to \u0396\u039a parallel to \u039a\u03a8, and let this be \u039f\u0396.","714":"Now since \u0396\u03a9\u039f is equal to \u039a\u03a3\u03a8, and \u039a\u03a3 is imperceptibly greater than \u03a8\u03a3  or \u03a9\u039f (because \u039a\u03a8\u03a3 is right, and the angle at \u03a3 is not greater than 2\u00b0 3\u2019, so that if \u03a8\u03a3 is 100,000, \u039a\u03a3 is 100,064), \u039f\u0396 is also imperceptibly less than \u039a\u03a8.","715":"Let \u0396\u0394 be joined, and let a line be drawn at \u039f parallel to \u0396\u0394.","716":"Now the moment of time at which the center of the epicycle is placed at \u0396 by Ptolemy and at \u039f by me, is the same, and is designated by both of us by the line \u039a\u03a5 in the theory of the sun.","717":"In the theory of Mars, that moment should be designated in the former theory by \u0396\u0394, because \u0394 is the point of equality, while in the new theory it will be designated by a line parallel to \u0396\u0394.","718":"Therefore, there will be a new point of equality, about which the time is counted, on this parallel through \u039f.","719":"Further, the same things occur when the center of the epicycle (in Ptolemy's account) is at the other end of the line of the sun\u2019s mean position in the neighborhood of \u039a\u03a5 (which, for the sake of brevity, I shall not prove).","720":"Therefore, if some line is again drawn parallel to the Ptolemaic line of the mean position of the center of the epicycle, a line \u0394\u0394 drawn from \u0394 to where the two new parallels intersect will be parallel to \u0396\u039f or \u03a8\u039a, equal to \u0396\u039f, and very nearly equal to \u03a8\u039a, and the new \u0394 will be the common point of equality in the new hypothesis.","721":"But at the end of Ch.","722":"5 above, it was shown that if through \u0394 a line \u0394\u0394 be drawn parallel to \u039a\u03a8, \u039a\u03a8 being equal to \u0394\u0394, and if the new \u0394 be joined to \u039a, and the new line \u039a\u0394 be cut at \u039c in the same ratio in which the previous \u039a\u0394 was cut at \u0394, then by this new hypothesis a new eccentric is constructed, that is, one having a different position from the former, which even if applied in the prior hypothesis would still leave all the appearances to an observer at \u039a very nearly undisturbed.","723":"Let such a new eccentric be described about \u039c, equal to the former, and let \u039a\u039c be extended in both directions.","724":"The new apogee will be \u0397, and the center of the epicycle will be on the points \u0392, \u039f, of the new eccentric, with the planet nearer at \u0391 and farther at \u0399 than before.","725":"However, in positions in which the second inequality is involved, the former observations are thoroughly and vehemently perturbed by this new eccentric introduced into their hypothesis.","726":"(This is clearly so if an epicycle equal to the sun\u2019s eccentric is attributed to the planet, as it must be if we wish to carry over the force of Copernicus\u2019s and Tycho\u2019s discoveries into the Ptolemaic form.)","727":"The reason is not that the point of equality \u0394 does not remain the same, but that near the positions of the sun\u2019s apsides the centers of the two eccentrics, the Ptolemaic and ours, are distant by an interval \u039b\u039c.","728":"Also, from this distance of the centers there necessarily follows an equal distance of the positions of the planetary body.","729":"Furthermore, this discrepancy is not greatest when the center of the epicycle is about the sun\u2019s middle distances.","730":"For it has been said that at those places the position of the center of the epicycle on either eccentric is nearly the same, even though they stand apart by parallels from \u0394\u0394.","731":"It is therefore greatest near the sun\u2019s apsides, and greater near perigee on \u039c\u039b extended so as to intersect the eccentrics at \u03a1 and \u0395. For \u03a1\u0395 is of the same magnitude as \u039c\u039b.","732":"But this one line \u039c\u039b does not designate the same moment, since it is not \u039c or \u039b that is the point of equality, but \u0394. Therefore, let parallels be drawn from \u0394\u0394 towards \u03a1 and \u0395, which shall designate the same moment, and let them be \u0394\u03a1 and \u0394\u0395.","733":"Also, let the epicycles \u039d and \u03a0 be described about \u03a1 and \u0395.","734":"The question now is, where would this discrepancy appear greatest, in terms of the circumference of the epicycle?","735":"It is certain that this does not occur at the parts of the epicycle nearest \u039a, the earth, because these parts would be in the same direction as \u039a, nor at the highest parts of the epicycle, because they would be too far away.","736":"Therefore, this will occur at the parts of the epicycle near perigee, therefore when the sun, and the planet with it, are not exactly at perigee but nearby: namely (to put it briefly) at the points \u039d and \u03a0 corresponding to the same moment of time, such that the small circle through them and \u039a is a minimum.","737":"The center of this small circle is, moreover, on the line through \u039a which, extended upward and meeting \u03a1\u0394 likewise extended, makes an angle of 7\u00bd degrees.","738":"Let anyone who disagrees with this adapt the previous demonstration to the present conditions.","739":"The numbers are just the same, except for Ptolemy \u039c\u039b is greater than \u03bc\u03bb, in the numbers taken above.","740":"For this reason, the difference in apparent  position, \u039d\u039a\u03a0, is also greater.","741":"For previously, \u03b2\u03ba was to \u03bb\u03bc as \u03b4\u03b2 was to \u03b4\u03bb, which is less than half \u03b4\u03b2.","742":"To Ptolemy, \u0394\u0394\n(equal to \u03b2\u03ba) would be to \u039c\u039b as the whole \u039a\u0394 is to the half, \u039a\u039b.","743":"Finally, I shall deduce the same things in the Tychonic hypothesis.","744":"About center B let the solar eccentric GS be described, with line of apsides BG, C the position of the immobile earth, and B the point of equality, following the opinion of the authorities.","745":"For it will be shown in due course that the point of equality and the center of the eccentric are not the same in the theory of the sun.","746":"Upon BC let the perpendiculars BS and CV be erected, and let SC be joined, so that CV may be the line of the sun\u2019s mean position, and CS, of its apparent position.","747":"Now, although Tycho Brahe had never finally decided whether to refer the planets to the lines CV, or to CS instead, in his initial conception he used the lines CV, according to the explanation he left in the Progymnasmata, vol.","748":"I p.","749":"477 and vol.","750":"II p.","751":"188.","752":"This is the way shown him by the footprints of Ptolemy and Copernicus.","753":"Of this path trodden by Tycho (if we proceed on it with Ptolemy\u2019s views), it should be said that whenever a planet is on one of the lines of the sun\u2019s mean position CV, on the side opposite the sun, the planet is divested of its second inequality, which, in Brahe\u2019s opinion, is applied to it on account of the motion of the center of the eccentric around the earth in the same time as the sun does so.","754":"This common point, with respect to which all the planets are said to perform their eccentric motion, and at which the whole planetary system is  conceived as being attached to the sun\u2019s orbit\u2014this point, I say, is always on the line of the sun\u2019s mean position, distant from the earth C by a constant distance BS, and describing a concentric V equal to the eccentric GS.","755":"This was Tycho Brahe\u2019s opinion\u2014except that he denied solid orbs.","756":"So what we said about the attachment of the whole system to the sun\u2019s orbit, we said to win over those who believe in solid orbs.","757":"Let VC be extended, and let the planet be on that line beyond C. In this configuration, Brahe will place the point at which the planetary system is attached at V. The planet will be observed on the line VC.","758":"So, even though the observer is on the earth, C, it is exactly as if he were at V, the point upon which the first inequality depends.","759":"Next, let the planet\u2019s sidereal position be taken with instruments whenever it shall be seen at some point on the line CV opposite V beyond C (let this be on the lines CV, CG, and points opposite).","760":"Thus the center of the planetary system will be on the circle VP, the sun at S and G, and the body of the planet opposite it at O and F.","761":"(Nevertheless, in the theory of Mars, the planet\u2019s eccentric is so small in proportion to the sun\u2019s eccentric that Mars\u2019s eccentric and the points O and F are nearer to the earth C than is the sun S, which was one of the reasons why Brahe denied the solidity of the orbs.)","762":"From many positions of this sort, as many, in fact, as he could obtain, Tycho Brahe used to investigate the hypothesis of the first inequality, by removing the magnitude of the orb VP and treating it as a single point, as though in the meanwhile the center VP of the planetary  system, the point at which the system is attached, had remained at rest.","763":"So he set up a comparison of the elapsed times with the angles which VO and PF, drawn from a single point (V and P coinciding), would form.","764":"These are in fact identical to the angles OCF and VCP.","765":"Suppose this treatment done, and let the line of apsides of the eccentric come out to be VLD or PLD, D the equalizing point, L the center of the eccentric on this line, and the eccentric HO and FH.","766":"Let this hypothesis correspond to all positions of the planet observed at the moment of the planet's opposition to the sun\u2019s mean position.","767":"For the present, I am postponing a more careful examination of whether this sort of hypothesis is in accord with physical principles\u2014a hypothesis, that is, in which the sun, through its motive mind paying attention to the earth, moves around the earth, and of itself (since it lacks an orb) drives itself forward nonuniformly according to its approach to or recession from the earth (unless you would make the earth more important than the sun and ascribe to the earth the sun's motive force); while this same sun (as in Copernicus) sends out a motive force to all the planets, sweeping them around itself with a degree of speed corresponding to their degree of nearness to the sun; the planets meanwhile striving to accomplish their approach to and recession from the sun on a small epicycle, and at the same time to follow the sun, wherever it is supposed to be, in those same tracks not proper to them; and thus any planet, and most of all the sun, attends to many things at once, and the actual trajectories of the planets through the aethereal air (as with Ptolemy) make spirals, such as were depicted in Ch.","768":"1.","769":"Whether, I say, these are fitting, we shall consider elsewhere when the occasion arises.","770":"Here, let this form of hypothesis be supposed true in its general features.","771":"The question is, whether it is also fitting, in particular, that the planets follow the sun\u2019s body S, G, or whether they instead follow the point V, P, void of any body, four solar semidiameters (no more) from the center of the sun, which is now above the sun and now below, now before and now behind.","772":"And further, whether it is more fitting that the force that drives the planets in an orb around the sun make its nest in the body of the sun S, G, or in some other point such as VP void of body.","773":"In brief:  if the axle [axis] (to derive the sense of the word roughly from a wagon) of the planetary system, to which the orbs of the planets are fastened as with a nail\u2014if this, I say, is near the sun, why not in the sun itself?","774":"If this axis or point of attachment travels around the earth both close to the sun and in the very same period, why does it describe its own peculiar path?","775":"Why does it not hold to the very same path as the sun?","776":"I therefore wholeheartedly conclude that if, perchance, Tycho Brahe\u2019s opinion on the world system be universally true, it must be accepted in such form that the center of the planetary system lies upon SG, exactly on the sun\u2019s path, not upon VP; and finally, that it is in the sun itself, and that for liberating the first or eccentric inequality from the second, one should use the planet\u2019s oppositions to the apparent position of the sun, not the mean.","777":"Brahe himself in his final days embraced this procedure unreservedly.","778":"Let us, then, see what is changed on the eccentric.","779":"Once again, as before, when the sun is on the line BC, as at G, and the planet is at F opposite point P, the planet F will be opposite the sun itself, G. Consequently, the sidereal position of the planet will appear to be the same,  along the line GF, whether the continuation of the line be CP or CG, because both have been made into one line.","780":"Therefore, according to either procedure, the planet is divested of the second inequality.","781":"But when the sun comes to the side of its eccentric (that is, to the middle distances), an appreciable difference arises.","782":"For let the sun have gone from G to S, let the line of the sun\u2019s mean position CV be in Aries, and the planet\u2019s line of vision CO be exactly opposite in Libra, so that VCO is one line.","783":"Since CS is beyond CV, the sun's apparent position is beyond opposition to the planet.","784":"But, because of my alteration, the center of the planetary system is not at V but at S when the planet is seen along CO.","785":"Therefore, SO being connected, the earth C will lie outside the line SO, and hence, the planet\u2019s apparent position on the line CO still is intermingled with the second inequality.","786":"Nor will CO be farther east at a later time, so as to be at opposition to CS.","787":"Instead, it will ascend toward CF, because the sun\u2019s motion, and with it the motion of the center of the planetary system and of all its parts (and thus those of the planet O and of the center of the eccentric L), is from the line CO upward towards F, and is much faster than the motion of the eccentric or planet at O about L from the point H towards the bottom.","788":"Consequently, O is appreciably drawn back westward by a motion extraneous, not proper, to the eccentric; and indeed, it is well known that the planets are retrograde at opposition to the sun.","789":"Therefore, at a time preceding the moment designated by CV (let it be CT), when the sun appears on  line CQ, the planet will be seen at the point opposite its apparent position, at I. And now, since in the present case it is supposed to have shed the second inequality, QCI will be collinear; that is, the point whence the eccentricity arises will be on the line CQ.","790":"But CI, the retrograde planet\u2019s line of vision, earlier in time, is beyond the later (and hence more westerly) line of vision CO.","791":"Therefore, CQ will also be beyond CV, and Q will be the system\u2019s new center, beyond the old, V. Moreover, the line IQ was made to be more distant from the line \u039fV to the east by the angle OCI, while the line of apsides VD or PD (from which the motion begins) remains parallel to itself in the entire circuit.","792":"As a result, it appears to be established that the planet goes farther in a shorter period of time around the center Q of the system than it previously did in a greater period of time about the center V of the system.","793":"It thereby becomes apparent what is changed in the apparent eccentric motion by this restoration from the sun\u2019s mean position to its apparent position.","794":"For when the center of the system is at G and the point opposite, the line of the apparent eccentric position remains unchanged, at Q it is moved forward, and opposite Q it is moved back, for at Q the time is diminished, and opposite Q it is increased.","795":"Also, these lines differ greatly from the original ones.","796":"Accordingly, when we repeatedly use a new operation, based upon these several apparent positions of the planet (opposite which we are supposing the center of the planetary system to be found; that is, in the sun itself), to investigate the causes and measure of the first inequality, the result of the operation differs greatly from the previous result.","797":"For we have just transposed the point of attachment from the circle VP, upon which Brahe had it move around, to the circle GS, that is, to the body of the sun.","798":"This new center always stands on a line parallel to CB, at a distance CB from the original Brahean point; for example, above V and P at S and G. Therefore with the point of equality D fixed (so that CV represents the same moment), in order for it to be possible both for the planet to be at O and for the point of attachment to be at S, a new line of apsides needs to be drawn through D and S or G. Consequently, according to the demonstrations of Ch.","799":"5 (which we have brought forward above, in explaining the Copernican form), with DS or DG drawn and divided at M in the ratio in which DP or DV are divided at L, let there be described about center M, with the same radius as before, a new eccentric.","800":"This will not only account for the later observations, upon which it was constructed, but, introduced into the prior hypothesis, it will also save the observations previously cited, with a precision of within five minutes.","801":"However, computations which are carried out upon the previous eccentric and this new one at positions other than night rising will in some places (particularly near the sun\u2019s perigee) be able to differ by more than one degree, if we use numbers fitting and proper for Mars, which have been furnished by Brahe.","802":"There is no need to repeat the demonstration.","803":"The drawing is easiest in the Copernican diagram, if from the earth \u03bd you set up a line parallel to \u03b2\u03ba, measure off upon it, at an interval \u03b2\u03ba above \u03bd, the center of the sun's eccentric, and upon this center set up the Brahean eccentric of the sun through k, and delete the Copernican center of the earth\u2019s eccentric.","804":"The differences of the hypotheses, and their equivalence in the first inequalities but discrepancy in the second, have now been expounded.","805":"Let us then conclude the first part, which, as I see it, is the most difficult of the entire work, because of the almost inescapable labyrinths of opinion and the perpetual ambiguities of words and extremely tiresome circumlocutions.","806":"What necessity it was, however, that forced me to prefix this body of instruction, will now directly appear in Ch.","807":"7.","808":"Anyone who is less energetic can defer the whole part until he understands the easier parts."},"Entities":{"0":[],"1":[],"2":[],"3":[],"4":[],"5":[["rise","ASTR"]],"6":[],"7":[],"8":[["diurnal","ASTR"]],"9":[["sphere","GEOM"]],"10":[["north","ASTR"],["south","ASTR"]],"11":[["diurnal","ASTR"]],"12":[["conjunction","ASTR"]],"13":[],"14":[["interval","ASTR"],["circuit","ASTR"]],"15":[["Pythagoreans","NAME"]],"16":[],"17":[["star","ASTR"]],"18":[["star","ASTR"]],"19":[],"20":[],"21":[],"22":[],"23":[],"24":[],"25":[["Patricius,4","NAME"]],"26":[],"27":[["diurnal","ASTR"]],"28":[],"29":[["retrograde","ASTR"]],"30":[["fixed
