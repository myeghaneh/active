Now this observation is distant and isolated. It was reduced to the moment of opposition using the diurnal motion from the Prutenic Tables ^3. ","977":"On 1582 December 28 at 11h 30m, they set Mars down at 16\u00b0 47\u2019 Cancer by observation ^6. The moment of opposition assigned by Tycho comes 46 minutes later, during which the planet retrogressed less than one minute. Tycho therefore puts it at 16\u00b0 46\u2019 16\u201d Cancer ^7. On an inserted sheet here, an attempt was made to correct for a refraction of two minutes. This was, I think, first trial of the theory of refraction then being developed. Nevertheless, he followed the observed value unchanged, thus declining to consider the planet as something which could alter its position. Nor was there any need for  correction, since it was in Cancer, beyond the reach of refraction, and was in mid-sky where, in Cancer, there is no longitudinal parallax.","984":"On 1585 January 31 at 12h 0m, Mars was placed at 21\u00b0 18\u2019 11\u201d Leo ^8. The diurnal motion, by comparison of observations, was 24\u2019 15\u201d. The moment of opposition followed at 19h 35m, 7 hours and 35 minutes later. To this period belongs 7\u2019 41\u201d of diurnal motion westward. Therefore, at the designated moment, it would have been at 21\u00b0 10\u2019 30\u201d Leo, which is what was accepted. There is no mention of parallax. Nothing had to be done about refraction, because Mars was high and at mid-sky. I therefore find the bit of advice in the table about refraction (properly) ignored.","992":"On 1587 March 7 at 19h 10m they deduced the position of Mars from the observations, which was 25\u00b0 10\u2019 20\u201d Virgo. This they kept in the table, but changed the time to 17h 22m. The difference of 1h 48m multiplied by a diurnal motion of 24\u2019 gives the same number of minutes and seconds (that is, 1\u2019 48\u201d), no more. It therefore should have been 25\u00b0 8\u2019 32\u201d Virgo, which also approaches nearer the point opposite the sun. The difference is of practically no importance ^9. ","997":"On 1589 April 15 at 12h 5m they established the position of Mars very carefully at 3\u00b0 58' 21\" Scorpio, and corrected for longitudinal parallax so as to make it 3\u00b0 57\u2019 11\u201d ^10. There remain 1h 30m until the designated moment of opposition, which, for a diurnal motion of 22', bring the planet back 1\u2019 22\u201d, so as to be at 3\u00b0 55\u2019 49\u201d. They took the value of 3\u00b0 58\u2019 10\u201d. The former is closer to the sun\u2019s mean position.","1001":"On 1591 June 6 at 12h 20m, Mars is placed at 27\u00b0 15\u2019 Sagittarius ^11. There remained 2 days 4 hours and 5 minutes until the designated moment. In four days it was found to be moved forward 1\u00b0 12\u2019 47\u201d. Therefore, to 2d 4h 5m correspond 39\u2019 29\u201d. Consequently, at that moment Mars was at 26\u00b0 35\u2019 31\u201d Sagittarius. There is no need to consider any horizontal variations in longitude, since Mars is at mid-sky and at the beginning of Capricorn. The table has 26\u00b0 32\u2019 Sagittarius.","1008":"On 1593 24 August at 10h 30m they report Mars as being at 12\u00b0 38\u2019 Pisces12 with an observed diurnal motion of 16\u2019 45\u201d, and this near the nonagesimal13 where there is no longitudinal parallax. The moment designated for the opposition preceded this by 8h 17m (for it was at 2h 13m),14 to which corresponds a motion of 5\u2019 48\u201d eastward. Therefore, the planet falls at 12\u00b0 43\u2019 48\u201d Pisces. And the table has 12\u00b0 43\u2019 45\u201d.","1012":"On 1595 October 30 at 8h 20m, they found Mars at 17\u00b0 48\u2019 Taurus, with a diurnal motion of 22\u2019 54\u201d ^15. The designated moment preceded by 11h 48m, for which is required a motion of Mars of 11\u2019 7\u201d eastward, so that it would be at 17\u00b0 59\u2019 7\u201d Taurus. But it was projected eastward on account of parallax. Therefore, possibly using another observation on the meridian, they put down 17\u00b0 56\u2019 15\u201d Taurus in the table.","1016":"On 1597 December 10 at 8h 30m, they first placed Mars at 3\u00b0 30\u2019 Cancer, and again at 4\u00b0 1\u2019 Cancer, the mean being 3\u00b0 45\u00bd\u2019 Cancer ^16. The moment of opposition came 3 days 5h 5m later, to which, from Magini, corresponds 1\u00b0 15\u2019 westward. Therefore, Mars would have been at 2\u00b0 30\u00bd\u2019 Cancer. In the table, it was put at 2\u00b0 28\u2019. The reason for the rough measurement, carried out with a measuring staff, is clear from the date. Tycho had left the island, leaving all  instruments but the staff behind. Nevertheless, he did not wish to ignore this opposition completely. But I wish he had still remained on the island, for this opposition was a marvelous opportunity, not often recurring within a man\u2019s lifetime, for examining Mars\u2019s parallax.","1027":"Hence, Mars is at 10\u00b0 38\u2019 46\u201d Leo, at an adjusted time of 11h 40m reduced to the meridian of Uraniborg. But on January 24\/February 3 at the same time it was at 6\u00b0 18\u2019 Leo. This gives a diurnal motion of 23\u2019 44\u201d, and a position on January 19\/29 at 9h 40m of 8\u00b0 18\u2019 45\u201d Leo, just as they put it.","1071":"Again, at 7h 15m on the morning of December 27, it was 36\u00b0 43\u2019 from Cor Leonis,7 whose latitude is 0\u00b0 26\u00bd\u2019; hence, its longitude at the end of 1582 is 17\u00b0 28\u2153\u2019 Cancer, altitude 14\u00b0 4\u2019, and thus affected by refraction. Therefore, from 8h 28\u00bdm in the evening to 19h 15m, an interval of 10h 46\u00bdm, it was observed to retrogress 9\u2154\u2019.","1087":"On 1583 January 16 at 7h 30m in the evening,11 Mars was 23\u00b0 29\u2019 from the bright star in the foot of Erichthonius at an altitude of 51\u00b0. The next morning at 5h 0m, it was 43\u00b0 58\u2019 from Cor Leonis at an altitude of 15\u00b0. And, measured by the straight edge, Mars was perfectly collinear with the two stars. And so, since Mars\u2019s motion is carried out along this line, Brahe made a note that the longitudinal parallax is given from the diurnal motion of Mars. This is obtained here as follows. On January 16 at 10\u00bdh it was 23\u00b0 27\u2019 from the bright star in the foot of Erichthonius. On January 17 at 10\u2157h 12 it was 23\u00b0 12\u00bd\u2019 from the same star. Therefore, the diurnal motion would be 14\u00bd\u2019. Now in order to comply with Brahe\u2019s advice, we must set out the distance between the foot of Erichthonius and Cor Leonis, which is found to be 67\u00b0 21\u2019. Subtracting Mars's distance from the bright star in the foot of Erichthonius, 23\u00b0 29\u2019, leaves Mars's distance from Cor Leonis, 43\u00b0 52\u2019, at 7\u00bdh in the evening, which at 5h in the morning was 43\u00b0 58\u2019, 6 minutes greater. The time interval is 9\u00bd hours, to which ought to correspond 5\u215d\u2019 of the diurnal motion. Here, therefore, the  sum of the two parallaxes is no more than \u215c\u2019 except that the amount of Mars\u2019s longitudinal refraction at 15\u00b0 is added to it. But this is quite small. For Cancer and Leo are setting extremely obliquely, and Mars's large northern latitude put it at nearly the same altitude as Cor Leonis.","1101":"On January 17 at 5h 20m in the evening,13 Mars was 23\u00b0 16\u2019 from the foot of Erichthonius. On the following day, the 18th, at 3h 0m in the morning, this distance was 23\u00b0 9\u2019, and at 5h 5m in the evening it was 23\u00b0 1\u00bd\u2019. So the motion over 23h 45m is 14\u00bd\u2019, but over 9h 40m it is 7\u2019. This should have been 6\u2019. We are left with a longitudinal parallax of no more than 1\u2019. Refraction does not affect anything, since in both instances the altitude of Mars was about 30\u00b0.","1112":"On January 18 at 8h 52m in the evening15 there was 44\u00b0 22\u2019 between Mars and Cor Leonis. At 4\u00beh in the morning the same distance was 44\u00b0 27\u2153\u2019. Therefore, the motion over 7h 53m was 5\u2153\u2019. On January 19 following, at 7h 3m, this distance was 44\u00b0 32\u00bd\u2019. Therefore, for 22h 11m the motion is 10\u00bd\u2019. And for 8 hours there would be less than 4\u2019 of motion. Our profit is about 1\u00bd\u2019 of parallax.","1115":"On January 18 at 8h 52m in the evening15 there was 44\u00b0 22\u2019 between Mars and Cor Leonis. At 4\u00beh in the morning the same distance was 44\u00b0 27\u2153\u2019. Therefore, the motion over 7h 53m was 5\u2153\u2019. On January 19 following, at 7h 3m, this distance was 44\u00b0 32\u00bd\u2019. Therefore, for 22h 11m the motion is 10\u00bd\u2019. And for 8 hours there would be less than 4\u2019 of motion. Our profit is about 1\u00bd\u2019 of parallax.","1293":"On 1590 March 4 at 7h 10m in the evening, Mars's declination was 9\u00b0 26\u2019","1297":"On 1592 January 23 at 10h 15m in the evening, Mars was at 11\u00b0 34\u2019 30\u201d Aries with latitude 0\u00b0 2\u2019 south ^3. The altitude of Mars was 25\u00b0, and therefore (from the table for the fixed stars),4 there was no refraction. The parallax was about as much as the sun's, because Mars and the sun were sextile, and were therefore about equally distant from earth ^5. Nearly all of this was latitudinal. Therefore, about two minutes of latitude must be added northward to Mars in order to free it from parallax, and it thus will fall upon the ecliptic. For on February 6 it was already at about 7\u2019 northern latitude ^6. ","1305":"On 1595 October 27 at 12h 20m, Mars's true latitude after the removal of parallax was 0\u00b0 2\u2019 20\u201d south ^8. On the 28th, when the parallax had similarly been removed, the latitude was 0\u00b0 0\u2019 25\u201d north ^9. Therefore,*  in the meanwhile, it was at the ascending node.","1317":"I. On the morning of 1595 January 4, when Mars was observed at 7h 10m at altitude 8\u00b0, with reference to Spica Virginis and Cor Scorpii,10 it was observed at latitude 0\u00b0 3\u2019 46\u201d N, and it was itself at 13\u00b0 36\u2019 40\u201d Sagittarius ^11. The  parallax is small, because Mars was more than twice as far from the earth as is the sun. Refraction, on the other hand, is large: 6\u2019 45\u201d from the table for the fixed stars, or 11 minutes from the table for the sun ^12. This is nearly all latitudinal, owing to the low altitude of the nonagesimal ^13. Therefore, Mars (reckoning by the refraction displayed by the sun) was really at a few minutes south latitude\u2014about 2 or 3, or even more.","1383":"Accordingly, on 1588 November 10 at 6h 30m in the morning the planet Mars was seen at 25\u00b0 31\u2019 Virgo, with a latitude of 1\u00b0 36\u2019 45\u201d north, the sun being at 21 Scorpio ^4. The sun is thus only 62\u00bd\u02da from Mars, although it should have been 72\u00b0 from Mars in order to make the triangle isosceles, as the problem requires. Therefore, Mars is then farther from the earth than from the sun. Consequently, its latitude at that place appeared less than was the true inclination.","1393":"Similarly, on 1586 October 22 at 6h in the morning, about dawn, there was about 6\u00b0 9\u2019 eastward between Mars and Cor Leonis ^6. The declination of Mars from the equator was 13\u00b0 0\u2019 40\u201d north. Hence, its apparent longitude is found to be 0\u00b0 7\u2019 Virgo,7 latitude 1\u00b0 36\u2019 6\u201d N ^8. The sun stood at 8\u00b0 Scorpio, 68\u00b0 from Mars. It should have been farther. Consequently, the line between Mars and the earth was longer than that between Mars and the sun. And so the apparent latitude was less than the true digression of the planet from the ecliptic, and this was, in fact, long before it reached the limit.","1460":"On 1585 April 26 at 9h 42m, Mars was seen at 21\u00b0 26\u2019 Leo with latitude 1\u00b0 49\u00be\u2019 north ^18. The sun was at 16\u00b0 Taurus, right near the node. Mars\u2019s line of vision was a little inclined, since Mars was beyond 16\u00b0 Leo. Therefore, the angle of maximum inclination of the planes was only a little greater than 1\u00b0 49\u00be\u2019; that is, 1\u00b0 50\u2019 or a little greater.","1464":"Similarly, near the other limit, on 1591 October 16 at 6h 30m in the evening, Mars was seen at 1\u00b0 27\u2153\u2019 Aquarius with latitude 2\u00b0 10\u215a\u2019 south, decreasing ^19. (For on October 10 preceding, the latitude was 2\u00b0 18\u2154\u2019,20 and on October 2 it was 2\u00b0 38\u00bd\u2018.) The sun was at 2\u00bd\u00b0 Scorpio, above the node. The earth was therefore below the node towards Mars. So because of this proximity, the observed latitude was greater than the inclination of the plane of the ecliptic. Fourteen days later, when the sun was at the node, if it were again to have decreased 28 minutes (the amount of decrease in the previous 14 days), there would remain 1\u00b0 45\u2019. But the ratio of decrease does not remain the same when the earth departs from a star, or vice versa. For at a greater distance the decrease is always less. Therefore nothing can be adduced here against a maximum inclination of 1\u00b0 50\u2019. On the contrary: it is indirectly confirmed.","1560":"Suppose, however, that on 1580 November 12 at 10h 50m Mars was observed at 8\u00b0 37\u2019 Gemini,3 and the motion over five days was 1\u00b0 55\u2019. Since at the given time the sun stood at 0\u00b0 45\u2019 36\u201c Sagittarius, and its motion over five days is 5\u00b0 5\u2019, the sum of the two motions will come to 7\u00b0 0\u2019. But the sun is 7\u00b0 51\u2019 24\u201c removed from opposition to Mars. Of this, seven degrees exactly are traversed in 5 days, or 120 hours. So, according to the same ratio, the remaining 51\u2019 24\u201c will be traversed in 14 hours 41 minutes. Therefore, the moment of opposition was November 18 at 1h 31m. Its position was 6\u00b0 28\u2019 Gemini on the ecliptic. Now this is 20\u00b0 away from 16\u00bd\u00b0 Taurus. I want to know how much longer this makes the arc on the orbit extended from the node to the arc of  latitude through 6\u00b0 28\u2019 Gemini. So I turn to Philip Lansberg\u2019s trigonometry ^4. I mention him out of honor and gratitude, for he has supplied me in abundance with the finest axes, best adapted for building astronomical foundations, from nearby, and at little expense of time. Without him, these would have had to be sought from afar with great deal of trouble and toil, and the handles would not have been so well fitted. From Lansberge, then, the tangent of the 20\u00b0 side multiplied by the secant of the angle of inclination, 1\u00b0 50\u2019, the last five digits being dropped,5 gives an increase of only 18\u00bd of the smallest units, to which corresponds about 35 seconds. Mars therefore, standing opposite 6\u00b0 28\u2019 Gemini, is 35\u201c further along on its orbit. It should therefore be placed at 6\u00b0 28\u2019 35\u201c Gemini, a tiny and quite unnecessary correction.

But because Mars was elevated 37\u00bd\u00b0 above the horizon, diurnal parallax comes into the reckoning, and subtracts some small quantity from the longitude, thus making it 26\u00b0 26\u2019 Virgo, with a slightly greater latitude. For since the sun is nearly twice as far away from earth as is Mars, Mars\u2019s parallax will consequently be nearly twice the sun\u2019s. On the supposition that the sun\u2019s is 3\u2019, Mars\u2019s will be about 5\u2019. Now when 9\u00b0 Sagittarius is rising, the nonagesimal10 is 55\u00b0 from the zenith. Opposite this number in our parallactic table,11 under the column headed 5\u2019, the latitudinal parallax 4\u2019 is shown. Therefore, the latitude observed from the center of the earth would be 3\u00b0 42\u2019 22\u201c north. In Part V below, this will be useful to us in a more accurate examination of Mars\u2019s parallaxes, where a determination will be made of the precise inclination and of the absolutely certain distance of Mars for this position ^12. The sun\u2019s true position was 23\u00b0 59\u2019 11\u201c Pisces. The true opposition was therefore still to come. The stars were 2\u00b0 26\u2019 49\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 59\u2019 35\u201c, that of Mars 24\u2019, and their sum 1\u00b0 23\u2019 35\u201c. As this is to 24 hours, so is 2\u00b0 26\u2019 49\u201c to 1 day 18 hours 7 minutes, to which corresponds 42\u2019 7\u201c of Mars\u2019s motion. Therefore, the time of true opposition was March 6 at 7h 23m. Mars\u2019s position on the ecliptic was 25\u00b0 43\u2019 53\u201c Virgo. For the reduction to the orbit, 55\u201c must be subtracted. Therefore, on the orbit it was at 25\u00b0 43\u2019 Virgo. The latitude was decreasing. It was therefore somewhat less than 3\u00b0 38\u2019 N., or 3\u00b0 42\u2019 corrected for parallax.","1617":"On the night following 1589 April 15 at 12h 5m, the planet was found at 3\u00b0 58\u2019 20\u201c Scorpio,13 with latitude 1\u00b0 4\u2019 20\u201c north, decreasing. Mars\u2019s altitude was 22\u2155\u00b0, where refraction from the table for the fixed stars was zero, and from the table for the sun, 3\u00bd\u2019. But the parallax was about twice as great as the sun\u2019s, that is, 6 minutes at the horizon. The degree rising was 24\u00b0 Sagittarius. Therefore, the nonagesimal was 64\u00b0 from the zenith, giving a diurnal latitudinal parallax of 5\u2019 24\u201c. Whether it really was that much will become apparent below, through a careful consideration of latitudes ^14. For there, the northern latitude, free from diurnal parallax (and if there is no refraction), would come out to be 1\u00b0 9\u2019 45\u201c north. And because the altitude of the nonagesimal is 26\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax15 at the horizon is 2\u2019 38\u201c. But Mars is 40\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, counting from 4\u00b0 Scorpio to 24\u00b0 Virgo, which, under the column  headed 2\u2019 38\u201c shows a true longitudinal parallax of 1\u2019 42\u201c. That hastens Mars further forward than when viewed from the center of the earth, and this is so on the assumption that it underwent no refraction. But to me it is more probable that it undergoes the same refraction as the sun, greater, that is, than that of the fixed stars, because the opposition of the sun and Mars stirs up the air, while the fixed stars are observed when the air is as calm as possible. Still, let there be no refraction at all, and let Mars be placed at 3\u00b0 57\u2019 Scorpio. At that moment the sun was at 5\u00b0 36\u2019 20\u201c Taurus. At this time, therefore, Mars was 1\u00b0 39\u2019 20\u201c past opposition to the sun. Mars\u2019s diurnal motion, as is clear from comparison with April 13, is 22\u2019 8\u201c; the sun\u2019s, 58\u2019 10\u201c; the sum, 1\u00b0 20\u2019 18\u201c. As this is to 24 hours, so is 1\u00b0 39\u2019 20\u201c to 1 day 5 hours 42 minutes. Therefore, the moment of opposition was April 14 at 6h 23m PM. Its position was 4\u00b0 24\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio, or a little past, if refraction were applied or if the previously assumed value for the diurnal parallax was too great. For reduction to the orbit, some imperceptible quantity must be subtracted, since it is barely 12 degrees from the node. This would be about 24 seconds, which are of no importance, and Mars would be at 4\u00b0 24\u2019 Scorpio, with latitude three minutes greater than before. For from that position, the latitude was decreasing from the eighth of March; nor was it a maximum at opposition.\nVI. On the night following 1591 June 6 at 12h 20m, Mars was found at 27\u00b0 14\u2019 42\u201c Sagittarius,16 with latitude 3\u00b0 55\u00bd\u2019 south. Refraction was of course provided for (from the table for the fixed stars), since it was large, in that Mars had no more than 6\u00b0 altitude on the meridian. There was, however, no mention of parallax. But at that time Mars was distant from the earth by half the solar distance. Therefore, the horizontal parallax is greater than 6 minutes, on the supposition that the sun\u2019s parallax is 3\u2019. I omit it nonetheless, partly because the refraction is supplied from the table for the sun (which, as I said, is the more probable), exceeding that which Brahe took here by 4\u00bd\u2019, which almost completely cancels out the parallax; and partly because Mars was on the meridian and near the winter solstice point, and thus had no longitudinal parallax. Of the latitude, on the other hand, it will have to be seen below in Part IV whether it might not be a few minutes less, since the parallax projects the planet too far south.\nThe sun was at 24\u00b0 58\u2019 10\u201c Gemini. The difference in position between the stars was 2\u00b0 16\u2019 10\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 57\u2019 8\u201c, and Mars\u2019s (for four days) was 1\u00b0 12\u2019 24\u201c, since on June 10 at 11h 50m it was at 26\u00b0 2\u2019 18\u201c Sagittarius. For one day, therefore, 18\u2019 12\u201c. The sum of the diurnal motions is 1\u00b0 15\u2019 20\u201c. This corresponds to 1 day 19 hours 24 minutes, which, added to the 6th at 12h 20m (because opposition was yet to come), shows [the moment of opposition to be] the 8th at 7h 43m. Mars\u2019s position was 26\u00b0 41\u2019 48\u201c Sagittarius, to which are added 52\u201c for reduction to the orbit, so as to make it about 26\u00b0 43\u2019 Sagittarius. The latitude was six minutes greater than on 6 June, because, by the observations, the latitude here was increasing until the fortieth day after opposition, and increased nearly thirteen minutes between the 6th and the 10th of June. Therefore, ignoring parallax and keeping the same refraction, it would be 4\u00b0 1\u00bd\u2019 ^17. VII. On 1593 August 24 at 10h 30m, the ecliptic position of Mars was found  to be 12\u00b0 38\u2019 Pisces,18 with latitude 6\u00b0 5\u2019 30\u201c south. The altitude was great enough that horizontal variations canceled one another. On the August 29th following, at 10h 20m, Mars was observed at 11\u00b0 15\u2019 24\u201c Pisces, with latitude 5\u00b0 52\u2019 15\u201c south. It was decreasing precipitously. For before August 10 it was maximum, fourteen days before opposition. The motion for the five days was 1\u00b0 22\u2019 36\u201c, and for one day, 16\u2019 31\u201c. The sun\u2019s position on August 24 at 10\u00bdh was 11\u00b0 2\u2019 31\u201c Virgo. The stars were 1\u00b0 35\u2019 30\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 58\u2019 20\u201c. The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 14\u2019 51\u201c. This requires 1 day 6 hours 57 min. until opposition, so that this will be August 26 at 5h 27m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 12\u00b0 16\u2019 Pisces. Its latitude was 6\u00b0 2\u2019 south, approximately, if the horizontal variations do indeed cancel.","1639":"On the night following 1589 April 15 at 12h 5m, the planet was found at 3\u00b0 58\u2019 20\u201c Scorpio,13 with latitude 1\u00b0 4\u2019 20\u201c north, decreasing.

As this is to 24 hours, so is 1\u00b0 39\u2019 20\u201c to 1 day 5 hours 42 minutes. Therefore, the moment of opposition was April 14 at 6h 23m PM.

But Mars is 40\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, counting from 4\u00b0 Scorpio to 24\u00b0 Virgo, which, under the column  headed 2\u2019 38\u201c shows a true longitudinal parallax of 1\u2019 42\u201c. That hastens Mars further forward than when viewed from the center of the earth, and this is so on the assumption that it underwent no refraction. But to me it is more probable that it undergoes the same refraction as the sun, greater, that is, than that of the fixed stars, because the opposition of the sun and Mars stirs up the air, while the fixed stars are observed when the air is as calm as possible. Still, let there be no refraction at all, and let Mars be placed at 3\u00b0 57\u2019 Scorpio. At that moment the sun was at 5\u00b0 36\u2019 20\u201c Taurus. At this time, therefore, Mars was 1\u00b0 39\u2019 20\u201c past opposition to the sun. Mars\u2019s diurnal motion, as is clear from comparison with April 13, is 22\u2019 8\u201c; the sun\u2019s, 58\u2019 10\u201c; the sum, 1\u00b0 20\u2019 18\u201c. As this is to 24 hours, so is 1\u00b0 39\u2019 20\u201c to 1 day 5 hours 42 minutes. Therefore, the moment of opposition was April 14 at 6h 23m PM. Its position was 4\u00b0 24\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio, or a little past, if refraction were applied or if the previously assumed value for the diurnal parallax was too great. For reduction to the orbit, some imperceptible quantity must be subtracted, since it is barely 12 degrees from the node. This would be about 24 seconds, which are of no importance, and Mars would be at 4\u00b0 24\u2019 Scorpio, with latitude three minutes greater than before. For from that position, the latitude was decreasing from the eighth of March; nor was it a maximum at opposition.\nVI. On the night following 1591 June 6 at 12h 20m, Mars was found at 27\u00b0 14\u2019 42\u201c Sagittarius,16 with latitude 3\u00b0 55\u00bd\u2019 south. Refraction was of course provided for (from the table for the fixed stars), since it was large, in that Mars had no more than 6\u00b0 altitude on the meridian. There was, however, no mention of parallax. But at that time Mars was distant from the earth by half the solar distance. Therefore, the horizontal parallax is greater than 6 minutes, on the supposition that the sun\u2019s parallax is 3\u2019. I omit it nonetheless, partly because the refraction is supplied from the table for the sun (which, as I said, is the more probable), exceeding that which Brahe took here by 4\u00bd\u2019, which almost completely cancels out the parallax; and partly because Mars was on the meridian and near the winter solstice point, and thus had no longitudinal parallax. Of the latitude, on the other hand, it will have to be seen below in Part IV whether it might not be a few minutes less, since the parallax projects the planet too far south.\nThe sun was at 24\u00b0 58\u2019 10\u201c Gemini. The difference in position between the stars was 2\u00b0 16\u2019 10\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 57\u2019 8\u201c, and Mars\u2019s (for four days) was 1\u00b0 12\u2019 24\u201c, since on June 10 at 11h 50m it was at 26\u00b0 2\u2019 18\u201c Sagittarius. For one day, therefore, 18\u2019 12\u201c. The sum of the diurnal motions is 1\u00b0 15\u2019 20\u201c. This corresponds to 1 day 19 hours 24 minutes, which, added to the 6th at 12h 20m (because opposition was yet to come), shows [the moment of opposition to be] the 8th at 7h 43m. Mars\u2019s position was 26\u00b0 41\u2019 48\u201c Sagittarius, to which are added 52\u201c for reduction to the orbit, so as to make it about 26\u00b0 43\u2019 Sagittarius. The latitude was six minutes greater than on 6 June, because, by the observations, the latitude here was increasing until the fortieth day after opposition, and increased nearly thirteen minutes between the 6th and the 10th of June. Therefore, ignoring parallax and keeping the same refraction, it would be 4\u00b0 1\u00bd\u2019 ^17. VII. On 1593 August 24 at 10h 30m, the ecliptic position of Mars was found  to be 12\u00b0 38\u2019 Pisces,18 with latitude 6\u00b0 5\u2019 30\u201c south. The altitude was great enough that horizontal variations canceled one another. On the August 29th following, at 10h 20m, Mars was observed at 11\u00b0 15\u2019 24\u201c Pisces, with latitude 5\u00b0 52\u2019 15\u201c south. It was decreasing precipitously. For before August 10 it was maximum, fourteen days before opposition. The motion for the five days was 1\u00b0 22\u2019 36\u201c, and for one day, 16\u2019 31\u201c. The sun\u2019s position on August 24 at 10\u00bdh was 11\u00b0 2\u2019 31\u201c Virgo. The stars were 1\u00b0 35\u2019 30\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 58\u2019 20\u201c. The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 14\u2019 51\u201c. This requires 1 day 6 hours 57 min. until opposition, so that this will be August 26 at 5h 27m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 12\u00b0 16\u2019 Pisces. Its latitude was 6\u00b0 2\u2019 south, approximately, if the horizontal variations do indeed cancel.","1656":"On the night following 1589 April 15 at 12h 5m, the planet was found at 3\u00b0 58\u2019 20\u201c Scorpio,13 with latitude 1\u00b0 4\u2019 20\u201c north, decreasing. Mars\u2019s altitude was 22\u2155\u00b0, where refraction from the table for the fixed stars was zero, and from the table for the sun, 3\u00bd\u2019. But the parallax was about twice as great as the sun\u2019s, that is, 6 minutes at the horizon. The degree rising was 24\u00b0 Sagittarius. Therefore, the nonagesimal was 64\u00b0 from the zenith, giving a diurnal latitudinal parallax of 5\u2019 24\u201c. Whether it really was that much will become apparent below, through a careful consideration of latitudes ^14. For there, the northern latitude, free from diurnal parallax (and if there is no refraction), would come out to be 1\u00b0 9\u2019 45\u201c north. And because the altitude of the nonagesimal is 26\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax15 at the horizon is 2\u2019 38\u201c. But Mars is 40\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, counting from 4\u00b0 Scorpio to 24\u00b0 Virgo, which, under the column  headed 2\u2019 38\u201c shows a true longitudinal parallax of 1\u2019 42\u201c. That hastens Mars further forward than when viewed from the center of the earth, and this is so on the assumption that it underwent no refraction. But to me it is more probable that it undergoes the same refraction as the sun, greater, that is, than that of the fixed stars, because the opposition of the sun and Mars stirs up the air, while the fixed stars are observed when the air is as calm as possible. Still, let there be no refraction at all, and let Mars be placed at 3\u00b0 57\u2019 Scorpio. At that moment the sun was at 5\u00b0 36\u2019 20\u201c Taurus. At this time, therefore, Mars was 1\u00b0 39\u2019 20\u201c past opposition to the sun. Mars\u2019s diurnal motion, as is clear from comparison with April 13, is 22\u2019 8\u201c; the sun\u2019s, 58\u2019 10\u201c; the sum, 1\u00b0 20\u2019 18\u201c. As this is to 24 hours, so is 1\u00b0 39\u2019 20\u201c to 1 day 5 hours 42 minutes. Therefore, the moment of opposition was April 14 at 6h 23m PM. Its position was 4\u00b0 24\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio, or a little past, if refraction were applied or if the previously assumed value for the diurnal parallax was too great. For reduction to the orbit, some imperceptible quantity must be subtracted, since it is barely 12 degrees from the node.

For from that position, the latitude was decreasing from the eighth of March; nor was it a maximum at opposition.\nVI. On the night following 1591 June 6 at 12h 20m, Mars was found at 27\u00b0 14\u2019 42\u201c Sagittarius,16 with latitude 3\u00b0 55\u00bd\u2019 south. Refraction was of course provided for (from the table for the fixed stars), since it was large, in that Mars had no more than 6\u00b0 altitude on the meridian.

The difference in position between the stars was 2\u00b0 16\u2019 10\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 57\u2019 8\u201c, and Mars\u2019s (for four days) was 1\u00b0 12\u2019 24\u201c, since on June 10 at 11h 50m it was at 26\u00b0 2\u2019 18\u201c Sagittarius. For one day, therefore, 18\u2019 12\u201c. The sum of the diurnal motions is 1\u00b0 15\u2019 20\u201c. This corresponds to 1 day 19 hours 24 minutes, which, added to the 6th at 12h 20m (because opposition was yet to come), shows [the moment of opposition to be] the 8th at 7h 43m. Mars\u2019s position was 26\u00b0 41\u2019 48\u201c Sagittarius, to which are added 52\u201c for reduction to the orbit, so as to make it about 26\u00b0 43\u2019 Sagittarius. The latitude was six minutes greater than on 6 June, because, by the observations, the latitude here was increasing until the fortieth day after opposition, and increased nearly thirteen minutes between the 6th and the 10th of June. Therefore, ignoring parallax and keeping the same refraction, it would be 4\u00b0 1\u00bd\u2019 ^17. VII. On 1593 August 24 at 10h 30m, the ecliptic position of Mars was found  to be 12\u00b0 38\u2019 Pisces,18 with latitude 6\u00b0 5\u2019 30\u201c south. The altitude was great enough that horizontal variations canceled one another. On the August 29th following, at 10h 20m, Mars was observed at 11\u00b0 15\u2019 24\u201c Pisces, with latitude 5\u00b0 52\u2019 15\u201c south. It was decreasing precipitously. For before August 10 it was maximum, fourteen days before opposition. The motion for the five days was 1\u00b0 22\u2019 36\u201c, and for one day, 16\u2019 31\u201c. The sun\u2019s position on August 24 at 10\u00bdh was 11\u00b0 2\u2019 31\u201c Virgo. The stars were 1\u00b0 35\u2019 30\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 58\u2019 20\u201c. The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 14\u2019 51\u201c. This requires 1 day 6 hours 57 min. until opposition, so that this will be August 26 at 5h 27m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 12\u00b0 16\u2019 Pisces. Its latitude was 6\u00b0 2\u2019 south, approximately, if the horizontal variations do indeed cancel.","1671":"VIII. On 1595 October 30 at 8h 20m, the planet was found at 17\u00b0 47\u2019 15\u201c Taurus,19 not far from the nonagesimal. We may thus be sure of the parallax, although we must take it into account. The latitude was 0\u00b0 5\u2019 10\u201c north. The sun\u2019s position was 16\u00b0 50\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio. The distance between the stars was 56\u2019 45\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 35\u201c; that of Mars, 22\u2019 54\u201c, as appears by comparing the nearby observations. The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 23\u2019 29\u201c. If the distance between the stars be divided by this, it comes out to 40\u2019 47\u201c of a day, or 16 hours 19 min. Therefore, the true opposition was 0h 39m PM on October 31. Mars\u2019s position was 17\u00b0 31\u2019 40\u201c Taurus. This needs no reduction to the orbit, as it is nearly at the node. The latitude was about 0\u00b0 8\u2019 north. But comparison with the preceding and following days shows a latitude of about 5\u2019 north.\nIX. Let, at any rate, Mars\u2019s position on 1597 December 10 at 8h 30m be 3\u00b0 45\u00bd\u2019 Cancer (as above) ^20. The sun\u2019s position was 29\u00b0 4\u2019 53\u201c Sagittarius. The distance between the stars was 4\u00b0 40\u2019 37\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 61\u2019 20\u201c, that of Mars 23\u2019 40\u201c (for in 1580 the diurnal motion in Gemini was 23\u2019, and in 1582, at 17\u00b0 Cancer, it was 24\u2019). Therefore, the sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 25\u2019 0\u201c. These data show that the time of true opposition followed 3 days 7 hours 14 min. later, on December 14 at 3h 44m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 2\u00b0 27\u2153\u2019 Cancer. The reduction to the orbit (quite ridiculous here, since the observation itself has an uncertainty of several minutes) requires the addition of about 52\u201c. Therefore, the corrected position was 2\u00b0 28\u2019 Cancer. The latitude, from the table, was 3\u00b0 33\u2019 north.\nOn the same night, the one following December 10, at 12\u2159h, Fabricius in East Frisia found Mars\u2019s position to be 3\u00b0 40\u00bc\u2019 Cancer with latitude 3\u00b0 23\u2019 N. In this observation the longitude comes out nearly the same. For the motion over 3h 40m is 3\u00bd\u2019, so that in the Brahean observation too, at 12\u2159h Mars could have been at 3\u00b0 42\u2019 Cancer\u2014two minutes beyond the Fabrician position.\nX. On 1600 January 13\/23 at 11h 40m, the time being adjusted to Uraniborg time, the planet was observed at 10\u00b0 38\u2019 46\u201c Leo ^21. The sun\u2019s position was 3\u00b0 26\u2019 30\u201c Aquarius. The stars were 7\u00b0 12\u2019 16\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion for the next few days was 1\u00b0 1\u2019 3\u201c; that of Mars, 23\u2019 44\u201c. The sum: 1\u00b0 24\u2019 47\u201c. The opposition therefore followed 5 days 2h 22m after; that is, on January 19\/29 at 2h 2m in the morning, before dawn. Mars was at 8\u00b0 38\u2019 Leo. There is no need for reduction, since it is near the limit. The latitude, from the table, was 4\u00b0 30\u2019 50\u201c N.\nXI. On the evening of 1602 Febr. 18\/28 at 10h 30m, using the Tychonic  instruments (with the help of the learned Matthias Seiffard,22 bequeathed us by Tycho), I took the distance of Mars from the middle star of the tail of Ursa Major 23 to be 52\u00b0 22\u2019. And since the distance between Cor Leonis and Procyon was 37\u00b0 22\u2019 20\u201c, which should have been 37\u00b0 19\u2019 50\u201c,24 we know that the sextant reads 2\u00bd minutes high. Therefore, the corrected distance of Mars from the tail of Ursa was 52\u00b0 19\u00bd\u2019. And since the latitude of the fixed star is 56\u00b0 22\u2019, the remainder, by subtraction, is 4\u00b0 2\u00bd\u2019\u2014supposing that Mars was at precisely the same longitude as the fixed star. But because there was a difference of 3\u00be degrees between them (as is clear from the following observations), a slight correction is required.\n For let AB be 3\u00b0 43\u2019 30\u201c on a parallel close to the ecliptic, B Mars, C the fixed star, and BC 52\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c. Dividing the secant of BC by the secant of AB gives the  secant of CA, 52\u00b0 14\u2019, which, subtracted from 56\u00b0 22\u2019 (the latitude of the fixed star) leaves 4\u00b0 8\u2019 north as Mars\u2019s observed latitude. At the same time, we found 19\u00b0 23\u2019 between Mars and Cor Leonis (19\u00b0 20\u00bd corrected), and 21\u00b0 20\u2019 between Mars and the bright star in the wing of Virgo25 (21\u00b0 17\u00bd\u2019 corrected). From these two distances (using the latitudes of the stars and Mars), Mars\u2019s longitude is found to be 13\u00b0 19\u2019 6\u201c Virgo, by consensus of all measurements.\nAlternatively, the meridian altitude of Mars was found at 12h 40m, using two quadrants, to be 50\u00b0 19\u2019, while the tail of Leo26 was 56\u00b0 45\u2019. Therefore, from the declinations and right ascensions of the fixed stars and our distances, Mars\u2019s position is determined as 13\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c Virgo, latitude 4\u00b0 7\u2019 55\u201c ^27. This is the Tychonic procedure. I have included the other for the sake of showing a consensus, and also that it might be evident that despite the lack of absolute perfection in the demonstration, short cuts either in computation or in our understanding can under certain circumstances be applied. For in that previous procedure there is less in the actual work than in the reporting of it. At Prague, 5\u00b0 Scorpio was rising ^28. Therefore, the nonagesimal was about 32\u00bd\u00b0 from the zenith. And since Mars\u2019s distance from the earth was rather more than half the sun\u2019s distance, the resulting parallax of about 5\u2019 opposite 32\u00bd\u00b0 in our parallactic table, shows a latitudinal parallax of 2\u2019 41\u201c. Thus the latitude as seen from the middle of the earth would be 4\u00b0 10\u2154\u2019 north. And because the altitude of the nonagesimal was 57\u00bd\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax at the horizon was 4\u2019 13\u201c. But since Mars was 38\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, the longitudinal parallax corresponding to this position is 2\u2019 36\u201c, and if this be eliminated, Mars would be placed at about 13\u00b0 18\u2019 Virgo ^29. At that moment, the sun\u2019s position was 10\u00b0 16\u2019 42\u201c Pisces. The distance between the bodies was 3\u00b0 1\u2019 18\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 4\u201c, and that of Mars, 24\u2019 5\u201c (for it was 24\u2019 18\u201c at 21\u00b0 Leo in 1585, and 24\u2019 at 26 Virgo in 1587). The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 24\u2019 9\u201c. The true opposition therefore followed 2 days 3 hours 43 minutes later, on 21 February\/3 March before dawn at 2h 13m, Mars being at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 35\u201c Virgo. Forty seconds must be subtracted to reduce the position to the orbit, putting Mars at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 Virgo, with slightly less latitude than before, since the latitude was then decreasing. It was therefore about 4\u00b0 10\u2019, or 4\u00b0 7\u2153\u2019 if the parallax be neglected.\n But because, since Tycho\u2019s death, we have not made frequent observations nor continued them over several days, it would be best, for certainty\u2019s sake, also to make use of those observations which David Fabricius of East Frisia, a sedulous practitioner of astronomy, has communicated to me.\nOn February 16, old style, at 5h in the morning, he took the planet\u2019s distances from the tail of Leo (for the latitude), from the neck of Leo,30 and, on the other hand, from the bright star in the southern wing of Virgo, so as to check its longitude by working it out twice.\nI could make use of Tycho\u2019s line of reasoning, which he routinely adopted in volume I of the Progymnasmata when (as here) the declination of the planet was not known. But because that method extends to ten operations, I prefer for the sake of brevity to proceed as I did before with my own observations. Here there are no hidden dangers.\nFirst, the star in the wing of Virgo, adjusted to our time, is at 4\u00b0 36\u2019 30\u201c Libra with latitude 2\u00b0 50\u2019 north. Fabricius found that Mars is 20\u00b0 18\u2019 westward from it on the zodiac, which puts Mars at about 14\u00b0 18\u2019 30\u201c Virgo. This is a preliminary, approximate figure: the longitude will shortly be corrected. Now the tail of Leo31 is at 16\u00b0 4\u2019 Virgo, with latitude 12\u00b0 18\u2019 North, and Mars was found to be 8\u00b0 17\u2019 distant from the Tail. What is sought is the distance of its parallel from the Tail, since the difference in longitude is 1\u00b0 45\u2019. Dividing the secant of 8\u00b0 17\u2019 by the secant of 1\u00b0 45\u2019 gives the secant of 8\u00b0 6\u2019, the arc sought. This subtracted from the fixed star\u2019s northern latitude of 12\u00b0 18\u2019 leaves Mars\u2019s latitude, 4\u00b0 12\u2019 north. This I now take as determined, and compare it with the latitudes of the fixed stars according to the laws of trigonometry. From the Wing of Virgo, I find Mars\u2019s longitude to be 14\u00b0 19\u2019 Virgo; from the Neck of Leo, 14\u00b0 23\u2019 36\u201c. The mean of these two is 14\u00b0 21\u2019 18\u201c Virgo. And since the sextant gave distances larger than the truth, the latitude would come out at 4\u00b0 14\u2019 north.\nOn the night following February 23, at 12h, he observed Mars in relation to five fixed stars: the Tail of Leo and Arcturus for latitude, and for the longitude, in the first instance, Spica (which followed it), and, in the second, the Neck of Leo and Cor Leonis (which preceded it).\nBy a rough estimate, I foresee that Mars is going to fall at 11\u00bc\u00b0 Virgo. It was found to be 9\u00b0 24\u2019 from the Tail of Leo, and hence, its latitude comes out at 4\u00b0 6\u2019 ^32. And now, through this and the latitudes of the fixed stars, together with their distances (17\u00b0 26\u2019 from Regulus, 17\u00b0 51\u2019 from the Neck of Leo, 37\u00b0 28\u2019 from Spica, 44\u00b0 15\u2019 from Arcturus), Mars\u2019s position comes out at 11\u00b0 21\u2019 23\u201c Virgo (from Regulus), 11\u00b0 20\u2019 52\u201c Virgo (from the Neck of Leo), and 11\u00b0 17\u2019 40\u201c (from Spica). Again (as you see) the distances err in being too great. For from the Heart and the Neck [of Leo], Mars is pushed a little eastward, and from Spica and Arcturus a little westward, and more from Arcturus, owing to its greater northern latitude ^33. The mean (ignoring Arcturus), 11\u00b0 19\u2019 20\u201c Virgo, is very nearly true. Also, the latitude is greater, namely, 4\u00b0 7\u2019 40\u201c north. Now from February 15 at 17h to 23 February at 12h, a period of 7 days 19 hours, Mars moved 3\u00b0 0\u2019: 180 minutes in 187 hours. That is, about one minute per hour. And if you wish to take it into account, the parallax (if any) is subtracted from the longitude on February 16 and a little is added on February 23.\n Because the last observation follows the time of observation found by me by 2 days 21 hours 47 min., add the motion corresponding to this time, 1\u00b0 7\u2019: the position will come out 12\u00b0 26\u2019 Virgo. The agreement is thus very good\u2014it could not be better\u2014given that both of us [that is, Kepler and Fabricius] work independently and do not rely on the facilities used by Tycho Brahe.","1685":"VIII. On 1595 October 30 at 8h 20m, the planet was found at 17\u00b0 47\u2019 15\u201c Taurus,19 not far from the nonagesimal. We may thus be sure of the parallax, although we must take it into account. The latitude was 0\u00b0 5\u2019 10\u201c north. The sun\u2019s position was 16\u00b0 50\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio. The distance between the stars was 56\u2019 45\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 35\u201c; that of Mars, 22\u2019 54\u201c, as appears by comparing the nearby observations. The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 23\u2019 29\u201c. If the distance between the stars be divided by this, it comes out to 40\u2019 47\u201c of a day, or 16 hours 19 min. Therefore, the true opposition was 0h 39m PM on October 31. Mars\u2019s position was 17\u00b0 31\u2019 40\u201c Taurus. This needs no reduction to the orbit, as it is nearly at the node. The latitude was about 0\u00b0 8\u2019 north. But comparison with the preceding and following days shows a latitude of about 5\u2019 north.\nIX. Let, at any rate, Mars\u2019s position on 1597 December 10 at 8h 30m be 3\u00b0 45\u00bd\u2019 Cancer (as above) ^20. The sun\u2019s position was 29\u00b0 4\u2019 53\u201c Sagittarius. The distance between the stars was 4\u00b0 40\u2019 37\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 61\u2019 20\u201c, that of Mars 23\u2019 40\u201c (for in 1580 the diurnal motion in Gemini was 23\u2019, and in 1582, at 17\u00b0 Cancer, it was 24\u2019). Therefore, the sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 25\u2019 0\u201c. These data show that the time of true opposition followed 3 days 7 hours 14 min. later, on December 14 at 3h 44m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 2\u00b0 27\u2153\u2019 Cancer. The reduction to the orbit (quite ridiculous here, since the observation itself has an uncertainty of several minutes) requires the addition of about 52\u201c. Therefore, the corrected position was 2\u00b0 28\u2019 Cancer. The latitude, from the table, was 3\u00b0 33\u2019 north.\nOn the same night, the one following December 10, at 12\u2159h, Fabricius in East Frisia found Mars\u2019s position to be 3\u00b0 40\u00bc\u2019 Cancer with latitude 3\u00b0 23\u2019 N. In this observation the longitude comes out nearly the same. For the motion over 3h 40m is 3\u00bd\u2019, so that in the Brahean observation too, at 12\u2159h Mars could have been at 3\u00b0 42\u2019 Cancer\u2014two minutes beyond the Fabrician position.\nX. On 1600 January 13\/23 at 11h 40m, the time being adjusted to Uraniborg time, the planet was observed at 10\u00b0 38\u2019 46\u201c Leo ^21. The sun\u2019s position was 3\u00b0 26\u2019 30\u201c Aquarius. The stars were 7\u00b0 12\u2019 16\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion for the next few days was 1\u00b0 1\u2019 3\u201c; that of Mars, 23\u2019 44\u201c. The sum: 1\u00b0 24\u2019 47\u201c. The opposition therefore followed 5 days 2h 22m after; that is, on January 19\/29 at 2h 2m in the morning, before dawn. Mars was at 8\u00b0 38\u2019 Leo. There is no need for reduction, since it is near the limit. The latitude, from the table, was 4\u00b0 30\u2019 50\u201c N.\nXI. On the evening of 1602 Febr. 18\/28 at 10h 30m, using the Tychonic  instruments (with the help of the learned Matthias Seiffard,22 bequeathed us by Tycho), I took the distance of Mars from the middle star of the tail of Ursa Major 23 to be 52\u00b0 22\u2019. And since the distance between Cor Leonis and Procyon was 37\u00b0 22\u2019 20\u201c, which should have been 37\u00b0 19\u2019 50\u201c,24 we know that the sextant reads 2\u00bd minutes high. Therefore, the corrected distance of Mars from the tail of Ursa was 52\u00b0 19\u00bd\u2019. And since the latitude of the fixed star is 56\u00b0 22\u2019, the remainder, by subtraction, is 4\u00b0 2\u00bd\u2019\u2014supposing that Mars was at precisely the same longitude as the fixed star. But because there was a difference of 3\u00be degrees between them (as is clear from the following observations), a slight correction is required.\n For let AB be 3\u00b0 43\u2019 30\u201c on a parallel close to the ecliptic, B Mars, C the fixed star, and BC 52\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c. Dividing the secant of BC by the secant of AB gives the  secant of CA, 52\u00b0 14\u2019, which, subtracted from 56\u00b0 22\u2019 (the latitude of the fixed star) leaves 4\u00b0 8\u2019 north as Mars\u2019s observed latitude. At the same time, we found 19\u00b0 23\u2019 between Mars and Cor Leonis (19\u00b0 20\u00bd corrected), and 21\u00b0 20\u2019 between Mars and the bright star in the wing of Virgo25 (21\u00b0 17\u00bd\u2019 corrected). From these two distances (using the latitudes of the stars and Mars), Mars\u2019s longitude is found to be 13\u00b0 19\u2019 6\u201c Virgo, by consensus of all measurements.\nAlternatively, the meridian altitude of Mars was found at 12h 40m, using two quadrants, to be 50\u00b0 19\u2019, while the tail of Leo26 was 56\u00b0 45\u2019. Therefore, from the declinations and right ascensions of the fixed stars and our distances, Mars\u2019s position is determined as 13\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c Virgo, latitude 4\u00b0 7\u2019 55\u201c ^27. This is the Tychonic procedure. I have included the other for the sake of showing a consensus, and also that it might be evident that despite the lack of absolute perfection in the demonstration, short cuts either in computation or in our understanding can under certain circumstances be applied. For in that previous procedure there is less in the actual work than in the reporting of it. At Prague, 5\u00b0 Scorpio was rising ^28. Therefore, the nonagesimal was about 32\u00bd\u00b0 from the zenith. And since Mars\u2019s distance from the earth was rather more than half the sun\u2019s distance, the resulting parallax of about 5\u2019 opposite 32\u00bd\u00b0 in our parallactic table, shows a latitudinal parallax of 2\u2019 41\u201c. Thus the latitude as seen from the middle of the earth would be 4\u00b0 10\u2154\u2019 north. And because the altitude of the nonagesimal was 57\u00bd\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax at the horizon was 4\u2019 13\u201c. But since Mars was 38\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, the longitudinal parallax corresponding to this position is 2\u2019 36\u201c, and if this be eliminated, Mars would be placed at about 13\u00b0 18\u2019 Virgo ^29. At that moment, the sun\u2019s position was 10\u00b0 16\u2019 42\u201c Pisces. The distance between the bodies was 3\u00b0 1\u2019 18\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 4\u201c, and that of Mars, 24\u2019 5\u201c (for it was 24\u2019 18\u201c at 21\u00b0 Leo in 1585, and 24\u2019 at 26 Virgo in 1587). The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 24\u2019 9\u201c. The true opposition therefore followed 2 days 3 hours 43 minutes later, on 21 February\/3 March before dawn at 2h 13m, Mars being at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 35\u201c Virgo. Forty seconds must be subtracted to reduce the position to the orbit, putting Mars at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 Virgo, with slightly less latitude than before, since the latitude was then decreasing. It was therefore about 4\u00b0 10\u2019, or 4\u00b0 7\u2153\u2019 if the parallax be neglected.\n But because, since Tycho\u2019s death, we have not made frequent observations nor continued them over several days, it would be best, for certainty\u2019s sake, also to make use of those observations which David Fabricius of East Frisia, a sedulous practitioner of astronomy, has communicated to me.\nOn February 16, old style, at 5h in the morning, he took the planet\u2019s distances from the tail of Leo (for the latitude), from the neck of Leo,30 and, on the other hand, from the bright star in the southern wing of Virgo, so as to check its longitude by working it out twice.\nI could make use of Tycho\u2019s line of reasoning, which he routinely adopted in volume I of the Progymnasmata when (as here) the declination of the planet was not known. But because that method extends to ten operations, I prefer for the sake of brevity to proceed as I did before with my own observations. Here there are no hidden dangers.\nFirst, the star in the wing of Virgo, adjusted to our time, is at 4\u00b0 36\u2019 30\u201c Libra with latitude 2\u00b0 50\u2019 north. Fabricius found that Mars is 20\u00b0 18\u2019 westward from it on the zodiac, which puts Mars at about 14\u00b0 18\u2019 30\u201c Virgo. This is a preliminary, approximate figure: the longitude will shortly be corrected. Now the tail of Leo31 is at 16\u00b0 4\u2019 Virgo, with latitude 12\u00b0 18\u2019 North, and Mars was found to be 8\u00b0 17\u2019 distant from the Tail. What is sought is the distance of its parallel from the Tail, since the difference in longitude is 1\u00b0 45\u2019. Dividing the secant of 8\u00b0 17\u2019 by the secant of 1\u00b0 45\u2019 gives the secant of 8\u00b0 6\u2019, the arc sought. This subtracted from the fixed star\u2019s northern latitude of 12\u00b0 18\u2019 leaves Mars\u2019s latitude, 4\u00b0 12\u2019 north. This I now take as determined, and compare it with the latitudes of the fixed stars according to the laws of trigonometry. From the Wing of Virgo, I find Mars\u2019s longitude to be 14\u00b0 19\u2019 Virgo; from the Neck of Leo, 14\u00b0 23\u2019 36\u201c. The mean of these two is 14\u00b0 21\u2019 18\u201c Virgo. And since the sextant gave distances larger than the truth, the latitude would come out at 4\u00b0 14\u2019 north.\nOn the night following February 23, at 12h, he observed Mars in relation to five fixed stars: the Tail of Leo and Arcturus for latitude, and for the longitude, in the first instance, Spica (which followed it), and, in the second, the Neck of Leo and Cor Leonis (which preceded it).\nBy a rough estimate, I foresee that Mars is going to fall at 11\u00bc\u00b0 Virgo. It was found to be 9\u00b0 24\u2019 from the Tail of Leo, and hence, its latitude comes out at 4\u00b0 6\u2019 ^32. And now, through this and the latitudes of the fixed stars, together with their distances (17\u00b0 26\u2019 from Regulus, 17\u00b0 51\u2019 from the Neck of Leo, 37\u00b0 28\u2019 from Spica, 44\u00b0 15\u2019 from Arcturus), Mars\u2019s position comes out at 11\u00b0 21\u2019 23\u201c Virgo (from Regulus), 11\u00b0 20\u2019 52\u201c Virgo (from the Neck of Leo), and 11\u00b0 17\u2019 40\u201c (from Spica). Again (as you see) the distances err in being too great. For from the Heart and the Neck [of Leo], Mars is pushed a little eastward, and from Spica and Arcturus a little westward, and more from Arcturus, owing to its greater northern latitude ^33. The mean (ignoring Arcturus), 11\u00b0 19\u2019 20\u201c Virgo, is very nearly true. Also, the latitude is greater, namely, 4\u00b0 7\u2019 40\u201c north. Now from February 15 at 17h to 23 February at 12h, a period of 7 days 19 hours, Mars moved 3\u00b0 0\u2019: 180 minutes in 187 hours. That is, about one minute per hour. And if you wish to take it into account, the parallax (if any) is subtracted from the longitude on February 16 and a little is added on February 23.\n Because the last observation follows the time of observation found by me by 2 days 21 hours 47 min., add the motion corresponding to this time, 1\u00b0 7\u2019: the position will come out 12\u00b0 26\u2019 Virgo. The agreement is thus very good\u2014it could not be better\u2014given that both of us [that is, Kepler and Fabricius] work independently and do not rely on the facilities used by Tycho Brahe.","1698":"VIII. On 1595 October 30 at 8h 20m, the planet was found at 17\u00b0 47\u2019 15\u201c Taurus,19 not far from the nonagesimal. We may thus be sure of the parallax, although we must take it into account. The latitude was 0\u00b0 5\u2019 10\u201c north. The sun\u2019s position was 16\u00b0 50\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio. The distance between the stars was 56\u2019 45\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 35\u201c; that of Mars, 22\u2019 54\u201c, as appears by comparing the nearby observations. The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 23\u2019 29\u201c. If the distance between the stars be divided by this, it comes out to 40\u2019 47\u201c of a day, or 16 hours 19 min. Therefore, the true opposition was 0h 39m PM on October 31. Mars\u2019s position was 17\u00b0 31\u2019 40\u201c Taurus. This needs no reduction to the orbit, as it is nearly at the node. The latitude was about 0\u00b0 8\u2019 north. But comparison with the preceding and following days shows a latitude of about 5\u2019 north.\nIX. Let, at any rate, Mars\u2019s position on 1597 December 10 at 8h 30m be 3\u00b0 45\u00bd\u2019 Cancer (as above) ^20. The sun\u2019s position was 29\u00b0 4\u2019 53\u201c Sagittarius. The distance between the stars was 4\u00b0 40\u2019 37\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 61\u2019 20\u201c, that of Mars 23\u2019 40\u201c (for in 1580 the diurnal motion in Gemini was 23\u2019, and in 1582, at 17\u00b0 Cancer, it was 24\u2019). Therefore, the sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 25\u2019 0\u201c. These data show that the time of true opposition followed 3 days 7 hours 14 min. later, on December 14 at 3h 44m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 2\u00b0 27\u2153\u2019 Cancer. The reduction to the orbit (quite ridiculous here, since the observation itself has an uncertainty of several minutes) requires the addition of about 52\u201c. Therefore, the corrected position was 2\u00b0 28\u2019 Cancer. The latitude, from the table, was 3\u00b0 33\u2019 north.\nOn the same night, the one following December 10, at 12\u2159h, Fabricius in East Frisia found Mars\u2019s position to be 3\u00b0 40\u00bc\u2019 Cancer with latitude 3\u00b0 23\u2019 N. In this observation the longitude comes out nearly the same. For the motion over 3h 40m is 3\u00bd\u2019, so that in the Brahean observation too, at 12\u2159h Mars could have been at 3\u00b0 42\u2019 Cancer\u2014two minutes beyond the Fabrician position.\nX. On 1600 January 13\/23 at 11h 40m, the time being adjusted to Uraniborg time, the planet was observed at 10\u00b0 38\u2019 46\u201c Leo ^21. The sun\u2019s position was 3\u00b0 26\u2019 30\u201c Aquarius. The stars were 7\u00b0 12\u2019 16\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion for the next few days was 1\u00b0 1\u2019 3\u201c; that of Mars, 23\u2019 44\u201c. The sum: 1\u00b0 24\u2019 47\u201c. The opposition therefore followed 5 days 2h 22m after; that is, on January 19\/29 at 2h 2m in the morning, before dawn. Mars was at 8\u00b0 38\u2019 Leo. There is no need for reduction, since it is near the limit. The latitude, from the table, was 4\u00b0 30\u2019 50\u201c N.\nXI. On the evening of 1602 Febr. 18\/28 at 10h 30m, using the Tychonic  instruments (with the help of the learned Matthias Seiffard,22 bequeathed us by Tycho), I took the distance of Mars from the middle star of the tail of Ursa Major 23 to be 52\u00b0 22\u2019. And since the distance between Cor Leonis and Procyon was 37\u00b0 22\u2019 20\u201c, which should have been 37\u00b0 19\u2019 50\u201c,24 we know that the sextant reads 2\u00bd minutes high. Therefore, the corrected distance of Mars from the tail of Ursa was 52\u00b0 19\u00bd\u2019. And since the latitude of the fixed star is 56\u00b0 22\u2019, the remainder, by subtraction, is 4\u00b0 2\u00bd\u2019\u2014supposing that Mars was at precisely the same longitude as the fixed star. But because there was a difference of 3\u00be degrees between them (as is clear from the following observations), a slight correction is required.\n For let AB be 3\u00b0 43\u2019 30\u201c on a parallel close to the ecliptic, B Mars, C the fixed star, and BC 52\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c. Dividing the secant of BC by the secant of AB gives the  secant of CA, 52\u00b0 14\u2019, which, subtracted from 56\u00b0 22\u2019 (the latitude of the fixed star) leaves 4\u00b0 8\u2019 north as Mars\u2019s observed latitude. At the same time, we found 19\u00b0 23\u2019 between Mars and Cor Leonis (19\u00b0 20\u00bd corrected), and 21\u00b0 20\u2019 between Mars and the bright star in the wing of Virgo25 (21\u00b0 17\u00bd\u2019 corrected). From these two distances (using the latitudes of the stars and Mars), Mars\u2019s longitude is found to be 13\u00b0 19\u2019 6\u201c Virgo, by consensus of all measurements.\nAlternatively, the meridian altitude of Mars was found at 12h 40m, using two quadrants, to be 50\u00b0 19\u2019, while the tail of Leo26 was 56\u00b0 45\u2019. Therefore, from the declinations and right ascensions of the fixed stars and our distances, Mars\u2019s position is determined as 13\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c Virgo, latitude 4\u00b0 7\u2019 55\u201c ^27. This is the Tychonic procedure. I have included the other for the sake of showing a consensus, and also that it might be evident that despite the lack of absolute perfection in the demonstration, short cuts either in computation or in our understanding can under certain circumstances be applied. For in that previous procedure there is less in the actual work than in the reporting of it. At Prague, 5\u00b0 Scorpio was rising ^28. Therefore, the nonagesimal was about 32\u00bd\u00b0 from the zenith. And since Mars\u2019s distance from the earth was rather more than half the sun\u2019s distance, the resulting parallax of about 5\u2019 opposite 32\u00bd\u00b0 in our parallactic table, shows a latitudinal parallax of 2\u2019 41\u201c. Thus the latitude as seen from the middle of the earth would be 4\u00b0 10\u2154\u2019 north. And because the altitude of the nonagesimal was 57\u00bd\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax at the horizon was 4\u2019 13\u201c. But since Mars was 38\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, the longitudinal parallax corresponding to this position is 2\u2019 36\u201c, and if this be eliminated, Mars would be placed at about 13\u00b0 18\u2019 Virgo ^29. At that moment, the sun\u2019s position was 10\u00b0 16\u2019 42\u201c Pisces. The distance between the bodies was 3\u00b0 1\u2019 18\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 4\u201c, and that of Mars, 24\u2019 5\u201c (for it was 24\u2019 18\u201c at 21\u00b0 Leo in 1585, and 24\u2019 at 26 Virgo in 1587). The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 24\u2019 9\u201c. The true opposition therefore followed 2 days 3 hours 43 minutes later, on 21 February\/3 March before dawn at 2h 13m, Mars being at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 35\u201c Virgo. Forty seconds must be subtracted to reduce the position to the orbit, putting Mars at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 Virgo, with slightly less latitude than before, since the latitude was then decreasing. It was therefore about 4\u00b0 10\u2019, or 4\u00b0 7\u2153\u2019 if the parallax be neglected.\n But because, since Tycho\u2019s death, we have not made frequent observations nor continued them over several days, it would be best, for certainty\u2019s sake, also to make use of those observations which David Fabricius of East Frisia, a sedulous practitioner of astronomy, has communicated to me.\nOn February 16, old style, at 5h in the morning, he took the planet\u2019s distances from the tail of Leo (for the latitude), from the neck of Leo,30 and, on the other hand, from the bright star in the southern wing of Virgo, so as to check its longitude by working it out twice.\nI could make use of Tycho\u2019s line of reasoning, which he routinely adopted in volume I of the Progymnasmata when (as here) the declination of the planet was not known. But because that method extends to ten operations, I prefer for the sake of brevity to proceed as I did before with my own observations. Here there are no hidden dangers.\nFirst, the star in the wing of Virgo, adjusted to our time, is at 4\u00b0 36\u2019 30\u201c Libra with latitude 2\u00b0 50\u2019 north. Fabricius found that Mars is 20\u00b0 18\u2019 westward from it on the zodiac, which puts Mars at about 14\u00b0 18\u2019 30\u201c Virgo. This is a preliminary, approximate figure: the longitude will shortly be corrected. Now the tail of Leo31 is at 16\u00b0 4\u2019 Virgo, with latitude 12\u00b0 18\u2019 North, and Mars was found to be 8\u00b0 17\u2019 distant from the Tail. What is sought is the distance of its parallel from the Tail, since the difference in longitude is 1\u00b0 45\u2019. Dividing the secant of 8\u00b0 17\u2019 by the secant of 1\u00b0 45\u2019 gives the secant of 8\u00b0 6\u2019, the arc sought. This subtracted from the fixed star\u2019s northern latitude of 12\u00b0 18\u2019 leaves Mars\u2019s latitude, 4\u00b0 12\u2019 north. This I now take as determined, and compare it with the latitudes of the fixed stars according to the laws of trigonometry. From the Wing of Virgo, I find Mars\u2019s longitude to be 14\u00b0 19\u2019 Virgo; from the Neck of Leo, 14\u00b0 23\u2019 36\u201c. The mean of these two is 14\u00b0 21\u2019 18\u201c Virgo. And since the sextant gave distances larger than the truth, the latitude would come out at 4\u00b0 14\u2019 north.\nOn the night following February 23, at 12h, he observed Mars in relation to five fixed stars: the Tail of Leo and Arcturus for latitude, and for the longitude, in the first instance, Spica (which followed it), and, in the second, the Neck of Leo and Cor Leonis (which preceded it).\nBy a rough estimate, I foresee that Mars is going to fall at 11\u00bc\u00b0 Virgo. It was found to be 9\u00b0 24\u2019 from the Tail of Leo, and hence, its latitude comes out at 4\u00b0 6\u2019 ^32. And now, through this and the latitudes of the fixed stars, together with their distances (17\u00b0 26\u2019 from Regulus, 17\u00b0 51\u2019 from the Neck of Leo, 37\u00b0 28\u2019 from Spica, 44\u00b0 15\u2019 from Arcturus), Mars\u2019s position comes out at 11\u00b0 21\u2019 23\u201c Virgo (from Regulus), 11\u00b0 20\u2019 52\u201c Virgo (from the Neck of Leo), and 11\u00b0 17\u2019 40\u201c (from Spica). Again (as you see) the distances err in being too great. For from the Heart and the Neck [of Leo], Mars is pushed a little eastward, and from Spica and Arcturus a little westward, and more from Arcturus, owing to its greater northern latitude ^33. The mean (ignoring Arcturus), 11\u00b0 19\u2019 20\u201c Virgo, is very nearly true. Also, the latitude is greater, namely, 4\u00b0 7\u2019 40\u201c north. Now from February 15 at 17h to 23 February at 12h, a period of 7 days 19 hours, Mars moved 3\u00b0 0\u2019: 180 minutes in 187 hours. That is, about one minute per hour. And if you wish to take it into account, the parallax (if any) is subtracted from the longitude on February 16 and a little is added on February 23.\n Because the last observation follows the time of observation found by me by 2 days 21 hours 47 min., add the motion corresponding to this time, 1\u00b0 7\u2019: the position will come out 12\u00b0 26\u2019 Virgo. The agreement is thus very good\u2014it could not be better\u2014given that both of us [that is, Kepler and Fabricius] work independently and do not rely on the facilities used by Tycho Brahe.","1759":"VIII. On 1595 October 30 at 8h 20m, the planet was found at 17\u00b0 47\u2019 15\u201c Taurus,19 not far from the nonagesimal. We may thus be sure of the parallax, although we must take it into account. The latitude was 0\u00b0 5\u2019 10\u201c north. The sun\u2019s position was 16\u00b0 50\u2019 30\u201c Scorpio. The distance between the stars was 56\u2019 45\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 35\u201c; that of Mars, 22\u2019 54\u201c, as appears by comparing the nearby observations. The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 23\u2019 29\u201c. If the distance between the stars be divided by this, it comes out to 40\u2019 47\u201c of a day, or 16 hours 19 min. Therefore, the true opposition was 0h 39m PM on October 31. Mars\u2019s position was 17\u00b0 31\u2019 40\u201c Taurus. This needs no reduction to the orbit, as it is nearly at the node. The latitude was about 0\u00b0 8\u2019 north. But comparison with the preceding and following days shows a latitude of about 5\u2019 north.\nIX. Let, at any rate, Mars\u2019s position on 1597 December 10 at 8h 30m be 3\u00b0 45\u00bd\u2019 Cancer (as above) ^20. The sun\u2019s position was 29\u00b0 4\u2019 53\u201c Sagittarius. The distance between the stars was 4\u00b0 40\u2019 37\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 61\u2019 20\u201c, that of Mars 23\u2019 40\u201c (for in 1580 the diurnal motion in Gemini was 23\u2019, and in 1582, at 17\u00b0 Cancer, it was 24\u2019). Therefore, the sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 25\u2019 0\u201c. These data show that the time of true opposition followed 3 days 7 hours 14 min. later, on December 14 at 3h 44m in the morning. Mars\u2019s position was 2\u00b0 27\u2153\u2019 Cancer. The reduction to the orbit (quite ridiculous here, since the observation itself has an uncertainty of several minutes) requires the addition of about 52\u201c. Therefore, the corrected position was 2\u00b0 28\u2019 Cancer. The latitude, from the table, was 3\u00b0 33\u2019 north.\nOn the same night, the one following December 10, at 12\u2159h, Fabricius in East Frisia found Mars\u2019s position to be 3\u00b0 40\u00bc\u2019 Cancer with latitude 3\u00b0 23\u2019 N. In this observation the longitude comes out nearly the same. For the motion over 3h 40m is 3\u00bd\u2019, so that in the Brahean observation too, at 12\u2159h Mars could have been at 3\u00b0 42\u2019 Cancer\u2014two minutes beyond the Fabrician position.\nX. On 1600 January 13\/23 at 11h 40m, the time being adjusted to Uraniborg time, the planet was observed at 10\u00b0 38\u2019 46\u201c Leo ^21. The sun\u2019s position was 3\u00b0 26\u2019 30\u201c Aquarius. The stars were 7\u00b0 12\u2019 16\u201c apart. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion for the next few days was 1\u00b0 1\u2019 3\u201c; that of Mars, 23\u2019 44\u201c. The sum: 1\u00b0 24\u2019 47\u201c. The opposition therefore followed 5 days 2h 22m after; that is, on January 19\/29 at 2h 2m in the morning, before dawn. Mars was at 8\u00b0 38\u2019 Leo. There is no need for reduction, since it is near the limit. The latitude, from the table, was 4\u00b0 30\u2019 50\u201c N.\nXI. On the evening of 1602 Febr. 18\/28 at 10h 30m, using the Tychonic  instruments (with the help of the learned Matthias Seiffard,22 bequeathed us by Tycho), I took the distance of Mars from the middle star of the tail of Ursa Major 23 to be 52\u00b0 22\u2019. And since the distance between Cor Leonis and Procyon was 37\u00b0 22\u2019 20\u201c, which should have been 37\u00b0 19\u2019 50\u201c,24 we know that the sextant reads 2\u00bd minutes high. Therefore, the corrected distance of Mars from the tail of Ursa was 52\u00b0 19\u00bd\u2019. And since the latitude of the fixed star is 56\u00b0 22\u2019, the remainder, by subtraction, is 4\u00b0 2\u00bd\u2019\u2014supposing that Mars was at precisely the same longitude as the fixed star. But because there was a difference of 3\u00be degrees between them (as is clear from the following observations), a slight correction is required.\n For let AB be 3\u00b0 43\u2019 30\u201c on a parallel close to the ecliptic, B Mars, C the fixed star, and BC 52\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c. Dividing the secant of BC by the secant of AB gives the  secant of CA, 52\u00b0 14\u2019, which, subtracted from 56\u00b0 22\u2019 (the latitude of the fixed star) leaves 4\u00b0 8\u2019 north as Mars\u2019s observed latitude. At the same time, we found 19\u00b0 23\u2019 between Mars and Cor Leonis (19\u00b0 20\u00bd corrected), and 21\u00b0 20\u2019 between Mars and the bright star in the wing of Virgo25 (21\u00b0 17\u00bd\u2019 corrected). From these two distances (using the latitudes of the stars and Mars), Mars\u2019s longitude is found to be 13\u00b0 19\u2019 6\u201c Virgo, by consensus of all measurements.\nAlternatively, the meridian altitude of Mars was found at 12h 40m, using two quadrants, to be 50\u00b0 19\u2019, while the tail of Leo26 was 56\u00b0 45\u2019. Therefore, from the declinations and right ascensions of the fixed stars and our distances, Mars\u2019s position is determined as 13\u00b0 19\u2019 30\u201c Virgo, latitude 4\u00b0 7\u2019 55\u201c ^27. This is the Tychonic procedure. I have included the other for the sake of showing a consensus, and also that it might be evident that despite the lack of absolute perfection in the demonstration, short cuts either in computation or in our understanding can under certain circumstances be applied. For in that previous procedure there is less in the actual work than in the reporting of it. At Prague, 5\u00b0 Scorpio was rising ^28. Therefore, the nonagesimal was about 32\u00bd\u00b0 from the zenith. And since Mars\u2019s distance from the earth was rather more than half the sun\u2019s distance, the resulting parallax of about 5\u2019 opposite 32\u00bd\u00b0 in our parallactic table, shows a latitudinal parallax of 2\u2019 41\u201c. Thus the latitude as seen from the middle of the earth would be 4\u00b0 10\u2154\u2019 north. And because the altitude of the nonagesimal was 57\u00bd\u00b0, the longitudinal parallax at the horizon was 4\u2019 13\u201c. But since Mars was 38\u00b0 from the nonagesimal, the longitudinal parallax corresponding to this position is 2\u2019 36\u201c, and if this be eliminated, Mars would be placed at about 13\u00b0 18\u2019 Virgo ^29. At that moment, the sun\u2019s position was 10\u00b0 16\u2019 42\u201c Pisces. The distance between the bodies was 3\u00b0 1\u2019 18\u201c. The sun\u2019s diurnal motion was 1\u00b0 0\u2019 4\u201c, and that of Mars, 24\u2019 5\u201c (for it was 24\u2019 18\u201c at 21\u00b0 Leo in 1585, and 24\u2019 at 26 Virgo in 1587). The sum of the diurnal motions was 1\u00b0 24\u2019 9\u201c. The true opposition therefore followed 2 days 3 hours 43 minutes later, on 21 February\/3 March before dawn at 2h 13m, Mars being at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 35\u201c Virgo. Forty seconds must be subtracted to reduce the position to the orbit, putting Mars at 12\u00b0 27\u2019 Virgo, with slightly less latitude than before, since the latitude was then decreasing. It was therefore about 4\u00b0 10\u2019, or 4\u00b0 7\u2153\u2019 if the parallax be neglected.\n But because, since Tycho\u2019s death, we have not made frequent observations nor continued them over several days, it would be best, for certainty\u2019s sake, also to make use of those observations which David Fabricius of East Frisia, a sedulous practitioner of astronomy, has communicated to me.\nOn February 16, old style, at 5h in the morning, he took the planet\u2019s distances from the tail of Leo (for the latitude), from the neck of Leo,30 and, on the other hand, from the bright star in the southern wing of Virgo, so as to check its longitude by working it out twice.\nI could make use of Tycho\u2019s line of reasoning, which he routinely adopted in volume I of the Progymnasmata when (as here) the declination of the planet was not known. But because that method extends to ten operations, I prefer for the sake of brevity to proceed as I did before with my own observations. Here there are no hidden dangers.\nFirst, the star in the wing of Virgo, adjusted to our time, is at 4\u00b0 36\u2019 30\u201c Libra with latitude 2\u00b0 50\u2019 north. Fabricius found that Mars is 20\u00b0 18\u2019 westward from it on the zodiac, which puts Mars at about 14\u00b0 18\u2019 30\u201c Virgo. This is a preliminary, approximate figure: the longitude will shortly be corrected. Now the tail of Leo31 is at 16\u00b0 4\u2019 Virgo, with latitude 12\u00b0 18\u2019 North, and Mars was found to be 8\u00b0 17\u2019 distant from the Tail. What is sought is the distance of its parallel from the Tail, since the difference in longitude is 1\u00b0 45\u2019. Dividing the secant of 8\u00b0 17\u2019 by the secant of 1\u00b0 45\u2019 gives the secant of 8\u00b0 6\u2019, the arc sought. This subtracted from the fixed star\u2019s northern latitude of 12\u00b0 18\u2019 leaves Mars\u2019s latitude, 4\u00b0 12\u2019 north. This I now take as determined, and compare it with the latitudes of the fixed stars according to the laws of trigonometry. From the Wing of Virgo, I find Mars\u2019s longitude to be 14\u00b0 19\u2019 Virgo; from the Neck of Leo, 14\u00b0 23\u2019 36\u201c. The mean of these two is 14\u00b0 21\u2019 18\u201c Virgo. And since the sextant gave distances larger than the truth, the latitude would come out at 4\u00b0 14\u2019 north.\nOn the night following February 23, at 12h, he observed Mars in relation to five fixed stars: the Tail of Leo and Arcturus for latitude, and for the longitude, in the first instance, Spica (which followed it), and, in the second, the Neck of Leo and Cor Leonis (which preceded it).\nBy a rough estimate, I foresee that Mars is going to fall at 11\u00bc\u00b0 Virgo. It was found to be 9\u00b0 24\u2019 from the Tail of Leo, and hence, its latitude comes out at 4\u00b0 6\u2019 ^32. And now, through this and the latitudes of the fixed stars, together with their distances (17\u00b0 26\u2019 from Regulus, 17\u00b0 51\u2019 from the Neck of Leo, 37\u00b0 28\u2019 from Spica, 44\u00b0 15\u2019 from Arcturus), Mars\u2019s position comes out at 11\u00b0 21\u2019 23\u201c Virgo (from Regulus), 11\u00b0 20\u2019 52\u201c Virgo (from the Neck of Leo), and 11\u00b0 17\u2019 40\u201c (from Spica). Again (as you see) the distances err in being too great. For from the Heart and the Neck [of Leo], Mars is pushed a little eastward, and from Spica and Arcturus a little westward, and more from Arcturus, owing to its greater northern latitude ^33. The mean (ignoring Arcturus), 11\u00b0 19\u2019 20\u201c Virgo, is very nearly true. Also, the latitude is greater, namely, 4\u00b0 7\u2019 40\u201c north. Now from February 15 at 17h to 23 February at 12h, a period of 7 days 19 hours, Mars moved 3\u00b0 0\u2019: 180 minutes in 187 hours. That is, about one minute per hour. And if you wish to take it into account, the parallax (if any) is subtracted from the longitude on February 16 and a little is added on February 23.\n Because the last observation follows the time of observation found by me by 2 days 21 hours 47 min., add the motion corresponding to this time, 1\u00b0 7\u2019: the position will come out 12\u00b0 26\u2019 Virgo. The agreement is thus very good\u2014it could not be better\u2014given that both of us [that is, Kepler and Fabricius] work independently and do not rely on the facilities used by Tycho Brahe.","2414":"Now to the observations: on 1585 May 18 at 10\u00bdh at night Mars was observed at 0\u00b0 50' 45\" Virgo with latitude 1\u00b0 19' 30\" north ^6. Magini puts it at 1\u00b0 5' Virgo,7 14' or 15' too much. Therefore, when on the 30th at 5h in the evening he puts it at 6\u00b0 48' Virgo, we shall again subtract the discrepancy of eleven days previously. So he will be left with 6\u00b0 34' Virgo. Here we will assume that some very few minutes are in error because the deduction over 12 days is too great, and the diurnal motion is not exactly the same as that obtained here from Magini. For consider that on April 18 preceding at 10h Mars was found at 17\u00b0 37\u00bd\u2019 Leo, while Magini puts it at 18\u00b0 0' Leo. The difference is 22\u00bd\u2019. Over the 33 days elapsed to May 18 this difference was diminished to the measure of 14\u00bc\u2019 . So if we extrapolate, since over 33 days eight minutes vanished, in the same ratio, over the 12 following days 3 minutes will vanish. Therefore, on May 30 the difference will be 11\u00bc\u2019. So, more accurately, Mars is at 6\u00b0 37' Virgo.","2420":"Similarly, on 1591 January 22 at 7h in the morning, Mars was 34\u00b0 32' 45\" from Spica with declination 17\u00b0 25' south, at an altitude of 16\u00b0 ^8. Therefore, after correction for horizontal variations, the declination was 17\u00b0 30'. Hence, the right ascension was 230\u00b0 23' 12\", longitude 22\u00b0 33' Scorpio, latitude 1\u00b0 0' 30\" north. Now this time differs from ours by 1 day 19 hours, and the diurnal motion, from Magini, is 33'. Therefore, 59' are required for the intervening time. Therefore, the remainder is the position of Mars on January 20 at 0h (which, as we said, corresponds to the other time): 21\u00b0 34' Scorpio.  ","2425":"Similarly, on 1591 January 22 at 7h in the morning, Mars was 34\u00b0 32' 45\" from Spica with declination 17\u00b0 25' south, at an altitude of 16\u00b0 ^8.

But because the Ninth is not described in Brahe's catalogue (since in its stead in the ninth place is another, distant by more than three degrees from the Ptolemaic, and less than all of them), we shall call upon the latitude of Mars as our counsel. For an approximate knowledge of it will suffice. Now the mean longitude of Mars on the morning of October 29 at 5h (which is an estimate, since I did not write down the time) is found to be 1s 29\u00b0 10' 43\". Therefore, its eccentric position was 9\u00b0 43' Gemini, 23\u00b0 20\u2019 from the node. Therefore, the inclination was 43' 52\". But the sun was at 15\u00b0 40' Scorpio, and the apparent position of Mars, by anticipation, was about 12\u00bd\u00b0 Cancer. Therefore, the latitude was 1\u00b0 36\u2019 24\" ^14. Let a computation be made of the longitude of a point on the line from the twelfth to the fourth, having a latitude of 1\u00b0 30\u00bd' North. Since the fourth is at 9\u00b0 54' Cancer, latitude 7\u00b0 43' N., and the twelfth is at 12\u00b0 56' Cancer, lat. 0\u00b0 13\u00bd' S., the longitude of our point, by interpolation, will be 12\u00b0 16' 17\" Cancer. But on 29 October, Mars was not yet here, and on the 30th it had already passed it. The diurnal motion was no more than 5 minutes, half of which is 2\u00bd', so that on the morning of the 30th it was at 12\u00b0 18\u00bd' Cancer. And so indeed it was at the end of 1600, but in 1597 it was at 12\u00b0 16' Cancer. Three minutes of error in latitude barely produce one in longitude. So the position is certain enough. If you also explore it using the first and the fifth, and use the point on that line whose latitude is 1\u00b0 30\u00bd', it falls at 12\u00b0 9' Cancer. And Mars was farther east, that is, forward in longitude, at about 12\u00b0 16' or a little before, also intermediate. Therefore, the latitude computed by us is confirmed. For it should be approximately intermediate, and indeed it is. That is, between the Martian latitude of 1\u00b0 30\u00bd' and the 5\u00b0 42\u00bd' of the fifth there is 4\u00b0 12', and between this and the 10\u00b0 2' of the first there is an intermediate 4\u00b0 20'.","4737":"Therefore, let Mars be at 12\u00b0 16' Cancer.

Now since the equated anomaly was 166\u00b0 36', the distance between Mars and the sun was 138,556, and between the earth and the sun, 100,666. Hence, in the diagram of Chapter 13, if A is the sun, B the earth, C Mars, and AB is 100,666, AC 138,556, and EBC 6\u00b0 2' 30\", the declination BAC of the orbit from the ecliptic at this point is shown to be 1\u00b0 39' 22\". And since the node is at 16\u00b0 43' Taurus,2 I subtract from this 12\u00b0 16' Pisces. There remains an arc of 64\u00b0 27'. And as the sine of this is to the inclination here of 1\u00b0 39' 22\", so is the whole sine to 1\u00b0 50' 10\", the inclination of the southern limit ^3. ","5910":"But since the position is rather far from the limit, in order to cut off any opportunity for suspicion, let us consult observations at positions other than acronychal, where Mars is near the limit. In undertaking this, I shall also present a universally applicable demonstration of the ratio between the inclination and the observed latitude. On 1593 July 21 at 14h (in astronomical terms),4 the planet was observed at 17\u00b0 45\u00be' Pisces, with latitude 5\u00b0 46\u00bc\u2019 south ^5. At this hour the eccentric position of Mars is found to be 20\u00b0 1\u00bd\u2019 Aquarius, while the sun's position was 8\u00b0 26' Leo.","6116":" And I was now about to choose the mean between 17\u00b0 Leo and 25\u00b0 Leo, namely, 21\u00b0 Leo, but the year 1585 gave me pause, since in that year the latitude observed at 21\u00b0 36' Leo was clearly not a maximum. For while the opposition was on the night following January 30, the latitude observed on the 24th, preceding the opposition, was 4\u00b0 31', still increasing, while on January 31, 16 hours past opposition, the observed latitude was again 4\u00b0 31'. It is therefore evident that on the 24th, if the opposition had occurred at that eccentric position, a latitude greater than 4\u00b0 31' would have been observed, for two reasons: first, because the celestial body was nearer the earth than when it was not at its acronychal position, and second, because Mars was farther from apogee, and was lower.","6538":" Let us therefore follow whither our inclinations and our arguments lead: as in the first case, in the second year of Antonine, on the 12th day of Epiphi, at the 8th hour, at Alexandria in Egypt, let Mars's mean motion from the  equinoctial be 11\u00b0 18' 30\" Sagittarius. This time corresponds to the common year of Christ 139 May 27. The difference of meridians between Hven and Alexandria is nearly two hours, from the most recent geographical tables. Therefore, at Hven in the year of Christ 139 May 27 at 6h the mean motion was 8s 11\u00b0 18' 30\". But in that year, Cor Leonis had a longitude of 2\u00b0 30' Leo, that is, 4s 2\u00b0 30' 0\". Therefore Mars's mean motion was 4s 8\u00b0 48' 30\" from Cor Leonis. But on  159944 May 27 at 6h Mars's mean motion was 0s 0\u00b0 47' 30\" from the equinoctial, while the distance of Cor Leonis from that point, as demonstrated by Brahe, was 4s 24\u00b0 15' 45\".

But the longitude of Cor Leonis was found to be 2\u00b0 30' Leo. Therefore, the mean motion of the sun preceded Cor Leonis by 5s 1\u00b0 47' 0\". But on 1599 February 23 at 3h 30m at Hven the mean motion of the sun was at 12\u00b0 47' 41\" Pisces, and Cor Leonis 24\u00b0 15\u2019 30\" Leo.
