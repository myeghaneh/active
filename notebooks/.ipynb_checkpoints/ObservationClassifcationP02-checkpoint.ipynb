    "Kepler's \"New Astronomy (Astronomia Nova)\" was completed and published in Linz in 1609. Buried deep in this, at times very mystical book, is Kepler's first formulation of his first and second laws of planetary motion, which in modern parlance can be stated as follows:\n",
    "*  Planetary orbits are ellipses, with the Sun located at one focus;\n",
    "*  Planets move along their elliptical orbit with a speed such that a line segment joining the planet to the Sun sweeps equal surface areas in equal time intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the same time he reconceptualized \"oppositions\" as based upon the observed, rather than \"average,\" position of the Sun, Kepler analyzed Brahe's individual **observations** of Mars for potential errors of various other kinds. With this introduction observations, sentiments play an important role in tracking the knowledge. This motivates us to:  \n",

These were, however, required courses, nothing that would bespeak an exceptional inclination towards astronomy. And since I was supported at the expense of the Duke of Württemberg, and saw my comrades, whom the Prince, upon request, kept trying to send to foreign countries, stalling in various ways out of love for their country, I, being hardier, quite maturely agreed with myself that whithersoever I was destined I would promptly go.   \n",

Thereafter, it was shown that whether we follow the sun's apparent motion and the hypothesis found in Ch. 16, or the sun's mean motion and the hypothesis proposed in Ch. 8 according to Brahe's revision, in both instances there result false distances of the planet from the center, whether of the sun (for Copernicus and Brahe) or of the world (for Ptolemy). Consequently, what we had previously constructed from the Brahean observations we have later in turn destroyed using other observations of his. This was the necessary consequence of our having followed (in imitation of previous theorists) several things that were plausible but really false.   \n",

Count back another 687. This will end up at 1592 January 23, when the planet was observed right at the node. If you do the same a third time, you will come out at 1590 March 7, while on the fourth day preceding, Mars had some southern latitude, which it would make up over the four days, so as to fall at the node about the seventh.   \n",

Nevertheless, he followed the observed value unchanged, thus declining to consider the planet as something which could alter its position.

Now this observation is distant and isolated. It was reduced to the moment of opposition using the diurnal motion from the Prutenic Tables ^3.    \n",
       "1  On 1582 December 28 at 11h 30m, they set Mars down at 16° 47’ Cancer by observation ^6. The moment of opposition assigned by Tycho comes 46 minutes later, during which the planet retrogressed less than one minute. Tycho therefore puts it at 16° 46’ 16” Cancer ^7. On an inserted sheet here, an attempt was made to correct for a refraction of two minutes. This was, I think, first trial of the theory of refraction then being developed. Nevertheless, he followed the observed value unchanged, thus declining to consider the planet as something which could alter its position. Nor was there any need for  correction, since it was in Cancer, beyond the reach of refraction, and was in mid-sky where, in Cancer, there is no longitudinal parallax.   \n",
       "2                                                                                                                                                                                 On 1585 January 31 at 12h 0m, Mars was placed at 21° 18’ 11” Leo ^8. The diurnal motion, by comparison of observations, was 24’ 15”. The moment of opposition followed at 19h 35m, 7 hours and 35 minutes later. To this period belongs 7’ 41” of diurnal motion westward. Therefore, at the designated moment, it would have been at 21° 10’ 30” Leo, which is what was accepted. There is no mention of parallax. Nothing had to be done about refraction, because Mars was high and at mid-sky. I therefore find the bit of advice in the table about refraction (properly) ignored.   \n",

This they kept in the table, but changed the time to 17h 22m. The difference of 1h 48m multiplied by a diurnal motion of 24’ gives the same number of minutes and seconds (that is, 1’ 48”), no more. It therefore should have been 25° 8’ 32” Virgo, which also approaches nearer the point opposite the sun. The difference is of practically no importance ^9.    \n",

There remain 1h 30m until the designated moment of opposition, which, for a diurnal motion of 22', bring the planet back 1’ 22”, so as to be at 3° 55’ 49”. They took the value of 3° 58’ 10”. The former is closer to the sun’s mean position.   \n",

There remained 2 days 4 hours and 5 minutes until the designated moment. In four days it was found to be moved forward 1° 12’ 47”. Therefore, to 2d 4h 5m correspond 39’ 29”. Consequently, at that moment Mars was at 26° 35’ 31” Sagittarius. There is no need to consider any horizontal variations in longitude, since Mars is at mid-sky and at the beginning of Capricorn. The table has 26° 32’ Sagittarius.   \n",

The moment designated for the opposition preceded this by 8h 17m (for it was at 2h 13m),14 to which corresponds a motion of 5’ 48” eastward. Therefore, the planet falls at 12° 43’ 48” Pisces. And the table has 12° 43’ 45”.   \n",

The designated moment preceded by 11h 48m, for which is required a motion of Mars of 11’ 7” eastward, so that it would be at 17° 59’ 7” Taurus. But it was projected eastward on account of parallax. Therefore, possibly using another observation on the meridian, they put down 17° 56’ 15” Taurus in the table.   \n",
       "8         On 1597 December 10 at 8h 30m, they first placed Mars at 3° 30’ Cancer, and again at 4° 1’ Cancer, the mean being 3° 45½’ Cancer ^16. The moment of opposition came 3 days 5h 5m later, to which, from Magini, corresponds 1° 15’ westward. Therefore, Mars would have been at 2° 30½’ Cancer. In the table, it was put at 2° 28’. The reason for the rough measurement, carried out with a measuring staff, is clear from the date. Tycho had left the island, leaving all  instruments but the staff behind. Nevertheless, he did not wish to ignore this opposition completely. But I wish he had still remained on the island, for this opposition was a marvelous opportunity, not often recurring within a man’s lifetime, for examining Mars’s parallax.   \n",

But on January 24/February 3 at the same time it was at 6° 18’ Leo. This gives a diurnal motion of 23’ 44”, and a position on January 19/29 at 9h 40m of 8° 18’ 45” Leo, just as they put it.   \n",

I certainly had enough intelligence, nor did I have any difficulty understanding the geometrical and astronomical topics included in the normal curriculum, aided as I was by figures, numbers, and proportions. These were, however, required courses, nothing that would bespeak an exceptional inclination towards astronomy. And since I was supported at the expense of the Duke of Württemberg, and saw my comrades, whom the Prince, upon request, kept trying to send to foreign countries, stalling in various ways out of love for their country, I, being hardier, quite maturely agreed with myself that whithersoever I was destined I would promptly go.   \n",

These were, however, required courses, nothing that would bespeak an exceptional inclination towards astronomy. And since I was supported at the expense of the Duke of Württemberg, and saw my comrades, whom the Prince, upon request, kept trying to send to foreign countries, stalling in various ways out of love for their country, I, being hardier, quite maturely agreed with myself that whithersoever I was destined I would promptly go.   \n",
