       "3188  Instead, in order to dissolve this suspicion that the motions are impeded, let us  take another example from the magnet. Its power is not at all impeded by the interposition of matter (because, of course, it is immaterial), but passes through sheets of silver, copper, gold, glass, bone, wood, and attracts iron lying beyond these sheets exactly as if no sheets were there. Granted, it is impeded by the interposition of a magnetic plate. But the cause is ready at hand: the plate acts as a counterpart to the magnet. It therefore overcomes, by its strength, the more distant magnet lying beyond it. And although it is impeded by the interposition of the iron plate, this too belongs to the magnetic nature, and it immediately drinks up the magnet's power and uses it as if it were its own.   \n",

For while the opposition was on the night following January 30, the latitude observed on the 24th, preceding the opposition, was 4° 31', still increasing, while on January 31, 16 hours past opposition, the observed latitude was again 4° 31'. It is therefore evident that on the 24th, if the opposition had occurred at that eccentric position, a latitude greater than 4° 31' would have been observed, for two reasons: first, because the celestial body was nearer the earth than when it was not at its acronychal position, and second, because Mars was farther from apogee, and was lower.   \n",
       "71   Let us therefore follow whither our inclinations and our arguments lead: as in the first case, in the second year of Antonine, on the 12th day of Epiphi, at the 8th hour, at Alexandria in Egypt, let Mars's mean motion from the  equinoctial be 11° 18' 30\" Sagittarius. This time corresponds to the common year of Christ 139 May 27. The difference of meridians between Hven and Alexandria is nearly two hours, from the most recent geographical tables. Therefore, at Hven in the year of Christ 139 May 27 at 6h the mean motion was 8s 11° 18' 30\". But in that year, Cor Leonis had a longitude of 2° 30' Leo, that is, 4s 2° 30' 0\". Therefore Mars's mean motion was 4s 8° 48' 30\" from Cor Leonis. But on  159944 May 27 at 6h Mars's mean motion was 0s 0° 47' 30\" from the equinoctial, while the distance of Cor Leonis from that point, as demonstrated by Brahe, was 4s 24° 15' 45\". Therefore Mars was 7s 6° 31' 45\" from Cor Leonis.   \n",

The moment of opposition assigned by Tycho comes 46 minutes later, during which the planet retrogressed less than one minute. Tycho therefore puts it at 16° 46’ 16” Cancer ^7. On an inserted sheet here, an attempt was made to correct for a refraction of two minutes. This was, I think, first trial of the theory of refraction then being developed. Nevertheless, he followed the observed value unchanged, thus declining to consider the planet as something which could alter its position. Nor was there any need for  correction, since it was in Cancer, beyond the reach of refraction, and was in mid-sky where, in Cancer, there is no longitudinal parallax.</td>\n",

The moment of opposition followed at 19h 35m, 7 hours and 35 minutes later. To this period belongs 7’ 41” of diurnal motion westward.

Since the present angle is greater, the distance of Mars from the earth turns out to be less than the distance of Mars from the sun. The apparent magnitude of the inclination—at least, of this point from the plane of the ecliptic—is consequently greater. But since on December 5 the planet in its eccentric motion was already several degrees beyond the limit, again diminishing its true digression from the ecliptic, this was consequently greater right at the limit. And since these two effects cancel one another, the maximum inclination of the planes will be about 1° 50’.</td>\n",

Mars’s altitude was 22⅕°, where refraction from the table for the fixed stars was zero, and from the table for the sun, 3½’. But the parallax was about twice as great as the sun’s, that is, 6 minutes at the horizon. The degree rising was 24° Sagittarius. Therefore, the nonagesimal was 64° from the zenith, giving a diurnal latitudinal parallax of 5’ 24“. Whether it really was that much will become apparent below, through a careful consideration of latitudes ^14. For there, the northern latitude, free from diurnal parallax (and if there is no refraction), would come out to be 1° 9’ 45“ north. And because the altitude of the nonagesimal is 26°, the longitudinal parallax15 at the horizon is 2’ 38“.

Now this observation is distant and isolated. It was reduced to the moment of opposition using the diurnal motion from the Prutenic Tables ^3.    \n",

The moment of opposition assigned by Tycho comes 46 minutes later, during which the planet retrogressed less than one minute. Tycho therefore puts it at 16° 46’ 16” Cancer ^7. On an inserted sheet here, an attempt was made to correct for a refraction of two minutes. This was, I think, first trial of the theory of refraction then being developed. Nevertheless, he followed the observed value unchanged, thus declining to consider the planet as something which could alter its position. Nor was there any need for  correction, since it was in Cancer, beyond the reach of refraction, and was in mid-sky where, in Cancer, there is no longitudinal parallax.   \n",

The diurnal motion, by comparison of observations, was 24’ 15”. The moment of opposition followed at 19h 35m, 7 hours and 35 minutes later. To this period belongs 7’ 41” of diurnal motion westward. Therefore, at the designated moment, it would have been at 21° 10’ 30” Leo, which is what was accepted. There is no mention of parallax. Nothing had to be done about refraction, because Mars was high and at mid-sky. I therefore find the bit of advice in the table about refraction (properly) ignored.   \n",

This they kept in the table, but changed the time to 17h 22m. The difference of 1h 48m multiplied by a diurnal motion of 24’ gives the same number of minutes and seconds (that is, 1’ 48”), no more. It therefore should have been 25° 8’ 32” Virgo, which also approaches nearer the point opposite the sun. The difference is of practically no importance ^9.    \n",

There remain 1h 30m until the designated moment of opposition, which, for a diurnal motion of 22', bring the planet back 1’ 22”, so as to be at 3° 55’ 49”. They took the value of 3° 58’ 10”.

The moment of opposition came 3 days 5h 5m later, to which, from Magini, corresponds 1° 15’ westward. Therefore, Mars would have been at 2° 30½’ Cancer. In the table, it was put at 2° 28’. The reason for the rough measurement, carried out with a measuring staff, is clear from the date. Tycho had left the island, leaving all  instruments but the staff behind. Nevertheless, he did not wish to ignore this opposition completely. But I wish he had still remained on the island, for this opposition was a marvelous opportunity, not often recurring within a man’s lifetime, for examining Mars’s parallax.   \n",

Therefore, from 8h 28½m in the evening to 19h 15m, an interval of 10h 46½m, it was observed to retrogress 9⅔’.   \n",
       "10  On 1583 January 16 at 7h 30m in the evening,11 Mars was 23° 29’ from the bright star in the foot of Erichthonius at an altitude of 51°. The next morning at 5h 0m, it was 43° 58’ from Cor Leonis at an altitude of 15°. And, measured by the straight edge, Mars was perfectly collinear with the two stars. And so, since Mars’s motion is carried out along this line, Brahe made a note that the longitudinal parallax is given from the diurnal motion of Mars. This is obtained here as follows. On January 16 at 10½h it was 23° 27’ from the bright star in the foot of Erichthonius. On January 17 at 10⅗h 12 it was 23° 12½’ from the same star. Therefore, the diurnal motion would be 14½’. Now in order to comply with Brahe’s advice, we must set out the distance between the foot of Erichthonius and Cor Leonis, which is found to be 67° 21’. Subtracting Mars's distance from the bright star in the foot of Erichthonius, 23° 29’, leaves Mars's distance from Cor Leonis, 43° 52’, at 7½h in the evening, which...   \n",

The parallax was about as much as the sun's, because Mars and the sun were sextile, and were therefore about equally distant from earth ^5. Nearly all of this was latitudinal. Therefore, about two minutes of latitude must be added northward to Mars in order to free it from parallax, and it thus will fall upon the ecliptic. For on February 6 it was already at about 7’ northern latitude ^6.    \n",

The  parallax is small, because Mars was more than twice as far from the earth as is the sun. Refraction, on the other hand, is large: 6’ 45” from the table for the fixed stars, or 11 minutes from the table for the sun ^12. This is nearly all latitudinal, owing to the low altitude of the nonagesimal ^13. Therefore, Mars (reckoning by the refraction displayed by the sun) was really at a few minutes south latitude—about 2 or 3, or even more.   \n",

The sun is thus only 62½˚ from Mars, although it should have been 72° from Mars in order to make the triangle isosceles, as the problem requires. Therefore, Mars is then farther from the earth than from the sun. Consequently, its latitude at that place appeared less than was the true inclination.   \n",

Therefore, since the sun was 73½° from Mars, the digression of the point which Mars then occupied on its orbit was a little less than 1° 53½’ (since there should have been  72° between Mars and the sun). Since the present angle is greater, the distance of Mars from the earth turns out to be less than the distance of Mars from the sun. The apparent magnitude of the inclination—at least, of this point from the plane of the ecliptic—is consequently greater. But since on December 5 the planet in its eccentric motion was already several degrees beyond the limit, again diminishing its true digression from the ecliptic, this was consequently greater right at the limit. And since these two effects cancel one another, the maximum inclination of the planes will be about 1° 50’.   \n",

It should have been farther. Consequently, the line between Mars and the earth was longer than that between Mars and the sun.

The sun was at 30° Pisces, 76 degrees from Mars. It should have been a little closer. Therefore, Mars’s true digression from the ecliptic was a little less than the observed latitude. However, this digression was not at its maximum, since Mars had not yet approached within about 25 degrees of the limit. So once again, indirect support is provided for a maximum digression of about 1° 50’ at the limit.   \n",

(For on October 10 preceding, the latitude was 2° 18⅔’,20 and on October 2 it was 2° 38½‘.) The sun was at 2½° Scorpio, above the node. The earth was therefore below the node towards Mars. So because of this proximity, the observed latitude was greater than the inclination of the plane of the ecliptic. Fourteen days later, when the sun was at the node, if it were again to have decreased 28 minutes (the amount of decrease in the previous 14 days), there would remain 1° 45’. But the ratio of decrease does not remain the same when the earth departs from a star, or vice versa. For at a greater distance the decrease is always less. Therefore nothing can be adduced here against a maximum inclination of 1° 50’. On the contrary: it is indirectly confirmed.   \n",

Since at the given time the sun stood at 0° 45’ 36“ Sagittarius, and its motion over five days is 5° 5’, the sum of the two motions will come to 7° 0’. But the sun is 7° 51’ 24“ removed from opposition to Mars. Of this, seven degrees exactly are traversed in 5 days, or 120 hours. So, according to the same ratio, the remaining 51’ 24“ will be traversed in 14 hours 41 minutes. Therefore, the moment of opposition was November 18 at 1h 31m. Its position was 6° 28’ Gemini on the ecliptic. Now this is 20° away from 16½° Taurus.

The distance was 1° 3’ 20“. The sun’s diurnal motion was 61’ 16“, that of Mars 24’ 15“, and their sum 85’ 31“. Now as 1° 25’ 31“ is to 24 hours, so is 1° 3’ 20“ to 17 hours 46 minutes, to which correspond about 18’ of Mars’s motion. Therefore the time was January 30 at 19h 14m, and Mars’s ecliptic position was 21° 36’ 10“ Leo. For reduction, some very small quantity is subtracted, because Mars is then beyond the limit. Therefore, the extension of the arc on the orbit from the following node is directed westward. But because Mars was only 4 or 5 degrees from the node, the subtraction is rendered quite imperceptible. The latitude, on the authority of the Tychonic table, was 4° 32’ 10“ north. For the observation on January 31 at 12h gave 4° 31’.

       "29  On the night following 1587 March 4, at 1h 16m past midnight, the position of Mars was found to be 26° 26’ 17“ Virgo,8 from Cor Leonis9 and Spica Virginis, with an observed latitude of 3° 38’ 16“ north. But because Mars was elevated 37½° above the horizon, diurnal parallax comes into the reckoning, and subtracts some small quantity from the longitude, thus making it 26° 26’ Virgo, with a slightly greater latitude. For since the sun is nearly twice as far away from earth as is Mars, Mars’s parallax will consequently be nearly twice the sun’s. On the supposition that the sun’s is 3’, Mars’s will be about 5’. Now when 9° Sagittarius is rising, the nonagesimal10 is 55° from the zenith. Opposite this number in our parallactic table,11 under the column headed 5’, the latitudinal parallax 4’ is shown. Therefore, the latitude observed from the center of the earth would be 3° 42’ 22“ north.

The distance between the stars was 4° 40’ 37“. The sun’s diurnal motion was 61’ 20“, that of Mars 23’ 40“ (for in 1580 the diurnal motion in Gemini was 23’, and in 1582, at 17° Cancer, it was 24’). Therefore, the sum of the diurnal motions was 1° 25’ 0“. These data show that the time of true opposition followed 3 days 7 hours 14 min. later, on December 14 at 3h 44m in the morning. Mars’s position was 2° 27⅓’ Cancer. The reduction to the orbit (quite ridiculous here, since the observation itself has an uncertainty of several minutes) requires the addition of about 52“. Therefore, the corrected position was 2° 28’ Cancer. The latitude, from the table, was 3° 33’ north.\n",
      "On the same night, the one following December 10, at 12⅙h, Fabricius in East Frisia found Mars’s position to be 3° 40¼’ Cancer with latitude 3° 23’ N. In this observation the longitude comes out nearly the same. For the motion over 3h 40m is 3½’, so that in the Brahean observation too, at 12⅙h Mars could have been at 3° 42’ Cancer—two minutes beyond the Fabrician position.\n",
      "X. On 1600 January 13/23 at 11h 40m, the time being adjusted to Uraniborg time, the planet was observed at 10° 38’ 46“ Leo ^21. The sun’s position was 3° 26’ 30“ Aquarius. The stars were 7° 12’ 16“ apart. The sun’s diurnal motion for the next few days was 1° 1’ 3“; that of Mars, 23’ 44“. The sum: 1° 24’ 47“. The opposition therefore followed 5 days 2h 22m after; that is, on January 19/29 at 2h 2m in the morning, before dawn. Mars was at 8° 38’ Leo. There is no need for reduction, since it is near the limit. The latitude, from the table, was 4° 30’ 50“ N.\n",
      "XI. On the evening of 1602 Febr. 18/28 at 10h 30m, using the Tychonic  instruments (with the help of the learned Matthias Seiffard,22 bequeathed us by Tycho), I took the distance of Mars from the middle star of the tail of Ursa Major 23 to be 52° 22’. And since the distance between Cor Leonis and Procyon was 37° 22’ 20“, which should have been 37° 19’ 50“,24 we know that the sextant reads 2½ minutes high. Therefore, the corrected distance of Mars from the tail of Ursa was 52° 19½’. And since the latitude of the fixed star is 56° 22’, the remainder, by subtraction, is 4° 2½’—supposing that Mars was at precisely the same longitude as the fixed star. But because there was a difference of 3¾ degrees between them (as is clear from the following observations), a slight correction is required.\n",
      " For let AB be 3° 43’ 30“ on a parallel close to the ecliptic, B Mars, C the fixed star, and BC 52° 19’ 30“. Dividing the secant of BC by the secant of AB gives the  secant of CA, 52° 14’, which, subtracted from 56° 22’ (the latitude of the fixed star) leaves 4° 8’ north as Mars’s observed latitude. At the same time, we found 19° 23’ between Mars and Cor Leonis (19° 20½ corrected), and 21° 20’ between Mars and the bright star in the wing of Virgo25 (21° 17½’ corrected). From these two distances (using the latitudes of the stars and Mars), Mars’s longitude is found to be 13° 19’ 6“ Virgo, by consensus of all measurements.\n",
      "Alternatively, the meridian altitude of Mars was found at 12h 40m, using two quadrants, to be 50° 19’, while the tail of Leo26 was 56° 45’. Therefore, from the declinations and right ascensions of the fixed stars and our distances, Mars’s position is determined as 13° 19’ 30“ Virgo, latitude 4° 7’ 55“ ^27. This is the Tychonic procedure. I have included the other for the sake of showing a consensus, and also that it might be evident that despite the lack of absolute perfection in the demonstration, short cuts either in computation or in our understanding can under certain circumstances be applied. For in that previous procedure there is less in the actual work than in the reporting of it. At Prague, 5° Scorpio was rising ^28. Therefore, the nonagesimal was about 32½° from the zenith. And since Mars’s distance from the earth was rather more than half the sun’s distance, the resulting parallax of about 5’ opposite 32½° in our parallactic table, shows a latitudinal parallax of 2’ 41“. Thus the latitude as seen from the middle of the earth would be 4° 10⅔’ north. And because the altitude of the nonagesimal was 57½°, the longitudinal parallax at the horizon was 4’ 13“. But since Mars was 38° from the nonagesimal, the longitudinal parallax corresponding to this position is 2’ 36“, and if this be eliminated, Mars would be placed at about 13° 18’ Virgo ^29. At that moment, the sun’s position was 10° 16’ 42“ Pisces. The distance between the bodies was 3° 1’ 18“. The sun’s diurnal motion was 1° 0’ 4“, and that of Mars, 24’ 5“ (for it was 24’ 18“ at 21° Leo in 1585, and 24’ at 26 Virgo in 1587). The sum of the diurnal motions was 1° 24’ 9“. The true opposition therefore followed 2 days 3 hours 43 minutes later, on 21 February/3 March before dawn at 2h 13m, Mars being at 12° 27’ 35“ Virgo. Forty seconds must be subtracted to reduce the position to the orbit, putting Mars at 12° 27’ Virgo, with slightly less latitude than before, since the latitude was then decreasing. It was therefore about 4° 10’, or 4° 7⅓’ if the parallax be neglected.\n",
      " But because, since Tycho’s death, we have not made frequent observations nor continued them over several days, it would be best, for certainty’s sake, also to make use of those observations which David Fabricius of East Frisia, a sedulous practitioner of astronomy, has communicated to me.\n",
      "On February 16, old style, at 5h in the morning, he took the planet’s distances from the tail of Leo (for the latitude), from the neck of Leo,30 and, on the other hand, from the bright star in the southern wing of Virgo, so as to check its longitude by working it out twice.\n",
      "I could make use of Tycho’s line of reasoning, which he routinely adopted in volume I of the Progymnasmata when (as here) the declination of the planet was not known. But because that method extends to ten operations, I prefer for the sake of brevity to proceed as I did before with my own observations. Here there are no hidden dangers.\n",
      "First, the star in the wing of Virgo, adjusted to our time, is at 4° 36’ 30“ Libra with latitude 2° 50’ north. Fabricius found that Mars is 20° 18’ westward from it on the zodiac, which puts Mars at about 14° 18’ 30“ Virgo. This is a preliminary, approximate figure: the longitude will shortly be corrected. Now the tail of Leo31 is at 16° 4’ Virgo, with latitude 12° 18’ North, and Mars was found to be 8° 17’ distant from the Tail. What is sought is the distance of its parallel from the Tail, since the difference in longitude is 1° 45’. Dividing the secant of 8° 17’ by the secant of 1° 45’ gives the secant of 8° 6’, the arc sought. This subtracted from the fixed star’s northern latitude of 12° 18’ leaves Mars’s latitude, 4° 12’ north. This I now take as determined, and compare it with the latitudes of the fixed stars according to the laws of trigonometry. From the Wing of Virgo, I find Mars’s longitude to be 14° 19’ Virgo; from the Neck of Leo, 14° 23’ 36“. The mean of these two is 14° 21’ 18“ Virgo. And since the sextant gave distances larger than the truth, the latitude would come out at 4° 14’ north.\n",
      "On the night following February 23, at 12h, he observed Mars in relation to five fixed stars: the Tail of Leo and Arcturus for latitude, and for the longitude, in the first instance, Spica (which followed it), and, in the second, the Neck of Leo and Cor Leonis (which preceded it).\n",
      "By a rough estimate, I foresee that Mars is going to fall at 11¼° Virgo. It was found to be 9° 24’ from the Tail of Leo, and hence, its latitude comes out at 4° 6’ ^32. And now, through this and the latitudes of the fixed stars, together with their distances (17° 26’ from Regulus, 17° 51’ from the Neck of Leo, 37° 28’ from Spica, 44° 15’ from Arcturus), Mars’s position comes out at 11° 21’ 23“ Virgo (from Regulus), 11° 20’ 52“ Virgo (from the Neck of Leo), and 11° 17’ 40“ (from Spica). Again (as you see) the distances err in being too great. For from the Heart and the Neck [of Leo], Mars is pushed a little eastward, and from Spica and Arcturus a little westward, and more from Arcturus, owing to its greater northern latitude ^33. The mean (ignoring Arcturus), 11° 19’ 20“ Virgo, is very nearly true. Also, the latitude is greater, namely, 4° 7’ 40“ north. Now from February 15 at 17h to 23 February at 12h, a period of 7 days 19 hours, Mars moved 3° 0’: 180 minutes in 187 hours. That is, about one minute per hour. And if you wish to take it into account, the parallax (if any) is subtracted from the longitude on February 16 and a little is added on February 23.\n",
      " Because the last observation follows the time of observation found by me by 2 days 21 hours 47 min., add the motion corresponding to this time, 1° 7’: the position will come out 12° 26’ Virgo. The agreement is thus very good—it could not be better—given that both of us [that is, Kepler and Fabricius] work independently and do not rely on the facilities used by Tycho Brahe.\n"
