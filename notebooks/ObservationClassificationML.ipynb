       "6694   As shown in Figure 2B, the Sun is assumed to be at the center of the planetary system. The longitudes of Mars and Earth's in reference to the center of the Sun are 198° 21' 30\" and 199° 20' 8\" respectively. The deviation of elongation between Mars and the Earth remain 58' 38\". To find the position of Mars at opposition, Kepler computed the angular distance that Mars and Earth—now substituting the place of the Sun—moved during 17 hours 20 minutes; Mars moved eastward about 16' 20\" and the Sun westward about 42' 18\". Accordingly, Kepler determined the longitude of Mars at opposition to be 198° 37' 50\" from which he subtracted about 39\" in order to correct Mars's orbit; he got 198° 37' 10\" (18° 37' 10\" Libra).   \n",
